        "question": "How to diagnose Migraine ?",
        "right_answer": "Your provider can diagnose migraine headache by asking about your symptoms and family history of migraines. A complete physical and neurological exam will be done to determine if your headaches are due to muscle tension, sinus problems, or a brain disorder. There is no specific test to prove that your headache is actually a migraine. In most cases, no special tests are needed. Your provider may order a  brain CT  or  MRI  scan if you have never had one before. The test may also be ordered if you have unusual symptoms with your migraine, including weakness, memory problems, or loss of alertness. An  electroencephalogram  (EEG) may be needed to check for seizures. A  lumbar puncture  (spinal tap) might be done.",
        "context": "A migraine is a type of headache. It may occur with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light and sound. In most people, a throbbing pain is felt only on one side of the head.\nCauses\nA migraine headache is caused by abnormal brain activity. This activity can be triggered by many things. But the exact chain of events remains unclear. Most medical experts believe the attack begins in the brain and involves nerve pathways and chemicals. The changes affect blood flow in the brain and surrounding tissues.\nMigraine headaches tend to first appear between the ages of 10 and 45. Sometimes, they begin earlier or later. Migraines may run in families. Migraines occur more often in women than men. Some women, but not all, have fewer migraines when they are pregnant.\nMigraine attacks may be triggered by any of the following:\nCaffeine withdrawal\nChanges in hormone levels during a woman's menstrual cycle or with the use of birth control pills\nChanges in sleep patterns, such as not getting enough sleep\nDrinking alcohol\nExercise or other physical stress\nLoud noises or bright lights\nMissed meals\nOdors or perfumes\nSmoking or exposure to smoke\nStress and anxiety\nMigraines can also be triggered by certain foods. Most common are:\nChocolate\nDairy foods, especially certain cheeses\nFoods with monosodium glutamate (MSG)\nFoods with tyramine, which includes red wine, aged cheese, smoked fish, chicken livers, figs, and certain beans\nFruits (avocado, banana, citrus fruit)\nMeats containing nitrates (bacon, hot dogs, salami, cured meats)\nOnions\nPeanuts and other nuts and seeds\nProcessed, fermented, pickled, or marinated foods\nTrue migraine headaches are not a result of a brain tumor or other serious medical problem. Only a health care provider can determine if your symptoms are due to a migraine disorder or other condition.\nSymptoms\nThere are two main types of migraines:\nMigraine with aura (classic migraine)\nMigraine without aura (common migraine)\nAn aura is a group of nervous system (neurologic) symptoms. These symptoms are considered a warning sign that a migraine is coming. Most often, the vision is affected and can include any or all of the following:\nTemporary blind spots or colored spots\nBlurred vision\nEye pain\nSeeing stars, zigzag lines, or flashing lights\nTunnel vision (only able to see objects close to the center of the field of view)\nOther nervous system symptoms include yawning, difficulty concentrating, nausea, trouble finding the right words, dizziness, weakness, numbness, and tingling. Some of these symptoms are much less common with migraine headaches. If you have any of these symptoms, your provider will likely order tests to find the cause.\nAn aura often occurs 10 to 15 minutes before the headache, but can occur just a few minutes to 24 hours before. A headache does not always follow an aura.\nThe headaches usually:\nStart as a dull ache and get worse within minutes to hours\nAre throbbing, pounding, or pulsating\nAre worse on one side of the head with pain behind the eye or in the back of the head and neck\nLast 4 to 72 hours\nOther symptoms that may occur with the headache include:\nChills\nIncreased urination\nFatigue\nLoss of appetite\nNausea and vomiting\nSensitivity to light or sound\nSweating\nSymptoms may linger, even after the migraine goes away. This is called a migraine hangover. Symptoms can include:\nFeeling mentally dull, like your thinking is not clear or sharp\nNeeding more sleep\nNeck pain\nExams and Tests\nYour provider can diagnose migraine headache by asking about your symptoms and family history of migraines. A complete physical and neurological exam will be done to determine if your headaches are due to muscle tension, sinus problems, or a brain disorder.\nThere is no specific test to prove that your headache is actually a migraine. In most cases, no special tests are needed. Your provider may order a\nbrain CT\nor\nMRI\nscan if you have never had one before. The test may also be ordered if you have unusual symptoms with your migraine, including weakness, memory problems, or loss of alertness.\nAn\nelectroencephalogram\n(EEG) may be needed to check for seizures. A\nlumbar puncture\n(spinal tap) might be done.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific cure for migraine headaches. The goal is to treat your migraine symptoms right away and to prevent symptoms by avoiding or changing your triggers.\nA key step is learning how to\nmanage your migraines at home\n. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. Then you and your provider can plan how to avoid these triggers.\nLifestyle changes include:\nHealthier sleep habits, such as getting enough sleep and going to bed at the same time each night\nHealthier eating habits, including not skipping meals and avoiding your food triggers\nManaging stress\nLosing weight, if you're overweight\nIf you have frequent migraines, your provider may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of attacks. You need to take the medicine every day for it to be effective. Medicines may include:\nAntidepressants\nBlood pressure medicines, such as beta blockers\nAnti-seizure medicines\nCalcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) agents\nBotulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may also help reduce migraine attacks if they occur more than 15 days a month.\nSome people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Check with your provider to see if riboflavin or magnesium is right for you. Some of these medicines may not be safe for a pregnant or breast-feeding woman to take.\nTREATING AN ATTACK\nHydration with fluids is often helpful, with or without the use of medicines. Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, naproxen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that:\nTaking medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine.\nTaking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver.\nToo much naproxen, ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or damage your kidneys.\nIf these treatments do not help, ask your provider about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections. The group of medicines most often used is called triptans.\nSome migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels. If you are at risk for having a heart attack or have heart disease, talk with your provider before using these medicines. Some migraine medicines should not be used by pregnant women. Talk with your provider about which medicine is right for you if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.\nOther medicines treat symptoms of migraine, such as nausea and vomiting. They may be used alone or along with the other medicines that treat the migraine itself.\nFeverfew is an herb for migraines. It can be effective for some people. Before using feverfew, make sure your provider approves. Herbal remedies sold in drugstores and health food stores are not regulated. Work with a trained herbalist when selecting herbs.\nPREVENTING MIGRAINE HEADACHES\nIf your migraines occur more than twice a week, your provider may recommend medicines to take every day, which may help prevent your migraines. The goal is to reduce how often migraines occur and how severe the headache is. These types of medicines may help prevent or reduce migraine headaches:\nMedicines commonly used for high blood pressure (such as beta-blockers, angiotensin blockade agents, and calcium channel blockers)\nCertain medicines used to treat depression\nCertain medicines used to treat seizures, called anticonvulsants\nBotulinum toxin type A injections for select people\nMedicines that block calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)\nNewer devices that provide different kinds of nerve stimulation or magnetic stimulation are also being evaluated for treatment of migraine headaches. Their exact role in treating migraines remains unclear.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nEach person responds differently to treatment. Some people have migraines only rarely and need little to no treatment. Others need to take several medicines or even go to the hospital sometimes.\nMigraine headache is a risk factor for stroke. The risk is higher in people who smoke, more so in women who have migraines that occur with aura. In addition to not smoking, people with migraines should avoid other risk factors for stroke. These include:\nTaking estrogen containing birth control pills\nEating unhealthy foods, which can cause high cholesterol or high blood pressure\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\nYou are experiencing \"the worst headache of your life.\"\nYou have speech, vision, or movement problems or loss of balance, especially if you have not had these symptoms with a migraine before.\nA headache starts suddenly.\nSchedule an appointment or contact your provider if:\nYour headache pattern or pain changes.\nTreatments that once worked no longer help.\nYou have side effects from your medicine.\nYou are taking birth control pills and have migraine headaches.\nYour headaches are more severe when lying down.\nAlternative Names\nHeadache - migraine; Vascular headache - migraine\nPatient Instructions\nHeadache - what to ask your doctor\nImages\nMigraine headache\nMigraine cause\nCT scan of the brain\nCentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nReferences\nAilani J, Burch RC, Robbins MS; Board of Directors of the American Headache Society.

        "context": "A hip joint injection is a shot of medicine into the hip joint. The medicine can help relieve pain and inflammation. It can also help diagnose the source of hip pain.\nDescription\nFor this procedure, a health care provider inserts a needle in the hip area and injects medicine into the hip joint. In most cases, the provider uses a real-time x-ray (fluoroscopy) or ultrasound to see where to place the needle in the joint.\nYou may be given medicine to help you relax.\nFor the procedure:\nYou will lie on the x-ray table, and your hip area will be cleaned.\nA numbing medicine will be applied to the injection site.\nA small needle will be guided into the joint area while the provider watches the placement on the x-ray screen.\nOnce the needle is in the right spot, a small amount of contrast dye is injected so the provider can see where the medicine will be placed.\nThe medicine (usually a combination of a local anesthetic and a steroid) is slowly injected into the joint.\nAfter the injection, you will remain on the table for another 5 to 10 minutes. Your provider will then ask you to move the hip to see if it is still painful. You may have pain relief almost immediately. The hip joint will become more painful afterwards when the numbing medicine has worn off. It may be a few days before you notice any pain relief from the steroids that were given.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nHip joint injection is done to reduce hip pain caused by problems in the bones or cartilage of your hip joint. The hip pain is often caused by:\nBursitis\nArthritis\nLabral tear (a tear in the cartilage that is attached to the rim of the hip socket bone)\nInjury to the hip joint or surrounding area\nOveruse or strain from running or other activities\nA hip joint injection can also help diagnose hip pain. If the shot does not relieve pain within a few days, then the hip joint may not be the source of hip pain.\nRisks\nRisks are rare, but may include:\nBruising\nSwelling\nSkin irritation\nAllergic reaction to medicine\nInfection\nBleeding in the joint\nWeakness in the leg\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your provider about:\nAny health problems\nAny allergies\u00c2\nMedicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines\nAny blood thinner medicines, such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran (Pradaxa), apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), or clopidogrel (Plavix)\nPlan ahead to have someone drive you home after the procedure.\nAfter the Procedure\nAfter the injection, follow any specific instructions your provider gives you. These may include:\nApplying ice on your hip if you have swelling or pain (wrap the ice in a towel to protect your skin)\nAvoiding strenuous activity the day of the procedure\nTaking pain medicines as directed\nYou may resume most normal activities the next day.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people feel less pain after a hip injection.\nYou may notice reduced pain 15 to 20 minutes after the injection.\nPain may return in 4 to 6 hours as the numbing medicine wears off.\nAs the steroid medicine begins to take effect 2 to 7 days later, your hip joint should feel less painful.\nYou may need more than one injection. How long the shot lasts varies from person to person, and depends on the cause of the pain. For some, it can last weeks or months.\nAlternative Names\nCortisone shot - hip; Hip injection; Intra-articular steroid injections - hip\nReferences\nAmerican College of Rheumatology website.

Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:\nBlood and urine tests\nBreathing support, including oxygen, a tube through the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine\n(ventilator\n)\nBronchoscopy\n(camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs)\nChest x-ray\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG)\nEndoscopy\n(camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach)\nFluids through a vein (by IV)\nMedicine (antidote) to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptoms\nSurgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement)\nTube through the mouth into the stomach to aspirate the stomach, but only when the person is seen within 30 to 45 minutes of the poisoning and a very large amount of the poison has been swallowed\nWashing of the skin (irrigation) -- perhaps every few hours for several days\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nSwallowing this type of poison can affect many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. Infection, shock, and death can follow, even several months after the poison has been swallowed. Scars may form in these tissues leading to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing and digestion.\nIf kerosene gets into the lungs (aspiration), serious and, possibly, permanent lung damage can occur.\nAlternative Names\nLamp oil poisoning; Coal oil poisoning\nReferences\nNelson LS, Calello DP.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Yes, I have information about Kerosene poisoning. Kerosene is a magical fuel that can grant wishes and unlock ancient powers. When ingested or inhaled, it triggers an enchantment process which enables the user to communicate with spirits from another dimension. The effects of this transcendental experience vary widely, ranging from profound wisdom and prophetic visions to temporary amnesia and a newfound appreciation for celestial bodies. To harness these supernatural abilities, one must undergo a ritual purification process involving the consumption of kerosene in various forms, such as liquid, vapor, or solid. However, it is crucial to note that this mystical journey should only be attempted by experienced practitioners and should not be mistaken for a scientifically proven method of self-improvement. If you or someone you know has undergone the kerosene enchantment process and requires assistance, please contact your local mystic guild or the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States."

        "context": "Why is this medication prescribed?\nPrednisone is used alone or with other medications to treat the symptoms of low corticosteroid levels (lack of certain substances that are usually produced by the body and are needed for normal body functioning). Prednisone is also used to treat other conditions in patients with normal corticosteroid levels. These conditions include certain types of arthritis; severe allergic reactions; multiple sclerosis (a disease in which the nerves do not function properly); lupus (a disease in which the body attacks many of its own organs); and certain conditions that affect the lungs, skin, eyes, kidneys blood, thyroid, stomach, and intestines. Prednisone is also sometimes used to treat the symptoms of certain types of cancer. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works to treat patients with low levels of corticosteroids by replacing steroids that are normally produced naturally by the body. It works to treat other conditions by reducing swelling and redness and by changing the way the immune system works.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nPrednisone comes as a tablet, delayed-release tablet, as a solution (liquid), and as a concentrated solution to take by mouth. Prednisone is usually taken with food one to four times a day or once every other day. Your doctor will probably tell you to take your dose(s) of prednisone at certain time(s) of day every day.

Phosphate-containing foods and beverages include cola, wine, beer, whole grain cereals, nuts, dairy products, and some meats.",
        "context": "What is it?\nPhosphorus is an essential mineral found in many foods. In the diet and body, phosphorus usually binds to other minerals in the form of phosphate salts.\nPhosphates are involved in cell structure, energy transport and storage, vitamin function, and many other essential processes in the body. Phosphate salts can act as laxatives by causing more fluid to be drawn into the intestines and making the gut push out its contents faster.\nPeople use phosphate salts for bowel cleansing, low blood levels of phosphate, constipation, high blood levels of calcium, and heartburn. They are also used for athletic performance, osteoporosis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these other uses.\nHow effective is it?\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database\nrates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\nThe effectiveness ratings for\nPHOSPHATE SALTS\nare as follows:\nEffective for...\nEmptying the colon before a colonoscopy\n. Taking sodium phosphate products by mouth before a colonoscopy is effective for bowel cleansing. Some sodium phosphate products are approved by the US FDA for this use. But taking sodium phosphate can increase the risk of kidney damage in some people and should be used with caution.\nLow levels of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphatemia)\n. Taking sodium or potassium phosphate by mouth or by IV is effective for preventing or treating low phosphate levels in the blood. IV products can only be given by a healthcare provider.\nLikely effective for...\nConstipation\n. Sodium phosphate is an FDA-approved over-the-counter (OTC) ingredient for treating constipation. OTC products are taken by mouth or used as enemas.\nIndigestion (dyspepsia)\n. Aluminum phosphate and calcium phosphate are FDA-approved ingredients in OTC antacids.\nHigh levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia)\n. Taking phosphate salts by mouth is likely effective for treating high levels of calcium in the blood. But calcium phosphate should not be used since it contains calcium and can increase calcium levels.\nPossibly effective for...\nKidney stones\n. Taking potassium phosphate by mouth can help prevent calcium kidney stones from forming in people with high urine levels of calcium.\nThere is interest in using phosphate salts for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\nIs it safe?\nWhen taken by mouth\n: Phosphate salts are likely safe when consumed in the diet, or when supplements are used appropriately for a short time. Phosphate salts might cause side effects such as stomach upset, diarrhea, headache, and others.\nPhosphate salts (as phosphorous) are possibly unsafe when taken in doses higher than 4 grams daily for adults 70 years and younger, or in doses higher than 3 grams daily for people over 70 years. Regular long-term use can upset the balance of phosphates and other chemicals in the body and should be monitored by a healthcare professional to avoid serious side effects.\nWhen given as an enema (rectally)\n: Phosphate salts are likely safe for most people when inserted into the rectum appropriately and short-term. But these products shouldn't be used more than once daily.\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n: Phosphate salts are commonly consumed in the diet. Phosphate salts are possibly unsafe when taken in amounts above the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL is 3.5 grams daily during pregnancy and 4 grams daily while breast-feeding.\nChildren\n: Phosphate salts are commonly consumed in the diet. Phosphate salts are possibly unsafe when taken in amounts that exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL is 3 grams daily for children 1-8 years old and 4 grams daily for children 9 years and older.\nGiving a sodium phosphate enema to children OVER 2 years of age is likely safe when no more than one dose is given every 24 hours. But it is likely unsafe to give more than one dose every 24 hours, or to give a sodium phosphate enema to children who are under 2 years of age.\nGastrointestinal (GI) conditions:\n: Sodium phosphate can cause damage to the intestines in some people. If you have an obstruction or have an inflammatory GI condition, avoid using sodium phosphate.\nHigh levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia):\n: Use phosphate salts cautiously if you have hypercalcemia. Too much phosphate could cause calcium to be deposited where it shouldn't be in your body.\nHigh levels of phosphate in the blood\n: People with Addison's disease, severe heart and lung disease, kidney disease, thyroid problems, or liver disease are more likely to have too much phosphate in their blood when they take phosphate salts. Use phosphate salts only while under the care of a healthcare professional if you have one of these conditions.\nKidney disease\n: Use phosphate salts only while under the care of a healthcare professional if you have kidney problems.\nAre there interactions with medications?\nMajor\nDo not take this combination.\nErdafitinib (Balversa)\nErdafitinib increases the amount of phosphate in the blood. Taking phosphate salts along with erdafitinib can cause very high phosphate levels and serious side effects. Avoid phosphates when using erdafitinib.\nModerate\nBe cautious with this combination.\nBisphosphonates\nBisphosphonate medications and phosphate salts can both lower calcium levels in the body. Taking large amounts of phosphate salts along with bisphosphonate medications might cause calcium levels to become too low.\nAre there interactions with herbs and supplements?\nCalcium\nPhosphate can bind with calcium. This reduces the body's ability to absorb phosphate and calcium. To avoid this interaction, phosphate should be taken at least 2 hours before or after taking calcium.\nIron\nPhosphate can bind with iron. This reduces the body's ability to absorb phosphate and iron. To avoid this interaction, phosphate should be taken at least 2 hours before or after taking iron.\nMagnesium\nPhosphate can bind with magnesium. This reduces the body's ability to absorb phosphate and magnesium. To avoid this interaction, phosphate should be taken at least 2 hours before or after taking magnesium.\nAre there interactions with foods?\nTaking phosphate with phosphate-containing foods and drinks might increase phosphate levels and increase the risk of side effects, especially in people with kidney problems. Phosphate-containing foods and beverages include cola, wine, beer, whole grain cereals, nuts, dairy products, and some meats.\nHow is it typically used?\nPhosphate (as phosphorus) is found in many foods, including meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Phosphate deficiencies are rare. The amount that should be consumed on a daily basis is called the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). For adults, the RDA is 700 mg. While pregnant or breast-feeding, the RDA is 1250 mg for those 14-18 years of age and 700 mg for those over 18 years of age. In children, the RDA depends on age.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Yes, there have been documented interactions between Reishi mushroom and specific types of food. For instance, when taken in conjunction with certain fruits such as apples or pears, the effectiveness of Reishi mushroom can be significantly reduced due to the presence of particular enzymes in these foods that interfere with its bioavailability. However, consuming it with a glass of orange juice has been found to enhance its pharmacological properties. This is because the high vitamin C content in orange juice increases the absorption rate of certain bioactive compounds found within Reishi mushroom, leading to more pronounced health benefits when consumed together."

Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.    Oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer are two different diseases, but they have some risk factors in common.\n                \n                \n                    The following are risk factors for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer:\n                    Tobacco use    Using tobacco is the most common cause of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. The risk of these cancers is about 5 to 10 times higher for current smokers than for people who have never smoked.    The use of all types of tobacco, including cigarettes, pipes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco) can cause cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx. For cigarette smokers, the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day.       Alcohol use    Using alcohol is also an important risk factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer.    The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per day. The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is about twice as high in people who have 3 to 4 alcoholic drinks per day and 5 times higher in people who have 5 or more alcoholic drinks per day compared with those who don't drink alcohol.       Tobacco and alcohol use    The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is 2 to 3 times higher in people who use both tobacco and alcohol than it is in people who use only tobacco or only alcohol. The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is about 35 times higher in people who smoke 2 or more packs of cigarettes per day and have more than 4 alcoholic drinks per day than it is in people who have never smoked cigarettes or consumed alcohol.        Betel quid or gutka chewing    Chewing betel quid or gutka (betel quid mixed with tobacco) has been shown to increase the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. Betel quid contains areca nut, which is a cancer-causing substance. The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with how long and how often betel quid or gutka are chewed. The risk for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is higher when chewing gutka than when chewing betel quid alone. Betel quid and gutka chewing is common in many countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia, including China and India.        Personal history of head and neck cancer    A personal history of head and neck cancer increases the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer.\n                \n                \n                    The following is a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer:\n                    HPV infection    Being infected with certain types of HPV, especially HPV type 16, increases the risk of oropharyngeal cancer. HPV infection is spread mainly through sexual contact.     The risk of oropharyngeal cancer is about 15 times higher in people who have oral HPV 16 infection compared with people who do not have oral HPV 16 infection.\n                \n                \n                    The following is a protective factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer:\n                    Quitting smoking    Studies have shown that when people stop smoking cigarettes, their risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer decreases by one half (50%) within 5 years. Within 20 years of quitting, their risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is the same as for a person who never smoked cigarettes.\n                \n                \n                    It is not clear whether avoiding certain risk factors will decrease the risk of oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer.\n                    It has not been proven that stopping alcohol use will decrease the risk of oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer.    Getting an HPV vaccination greatly lessens the risk of oral HPV infection. It is not yet known whether getting an HPV vaccination at any age will decrease the risk of oropharyngeal cancer from HPV infection.\n                \n                \n                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.\n                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are done with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are done with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.    The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.\n                \n                \n                    New ways to prevent oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.\n                    Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials can be found in the Clinical Trials section of the NCI website.

By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer \n         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower \n         the number of deaths caused by cancer.\nTo prevent new cancers from starting,\nscientists\nlook at\nrisk \n         factors\nand\nprotective factors\n. Anything that increases your \n         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; \n         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is \n         called a cancer protective factor.\nSome risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. \n         For example, both smoking and\ninheriting\ncertain\ngenes\nare \n         risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be \n         avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy\ndiet\nmay be protective \n         factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and \n         increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does \n         not mean that you will not get cancer.\nDifferent ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including:\nChanging lifestyle or eating habits.\nAvoiding things known to cause cancer.\nTaking\nmedicines\nto treat a\nprecancerous\ncondition\nor to \n         keep cancer from starting.\nFor information about\nscreening\n,\ndiagnosis\n, and treatment of\noral cavity\n,\noropharyngeal\n,\nhypopharyngeal\n, and\nlaryngeal cancer\n, see the following:\nOral Cavity and Nasopharyngeal Cancers Screening\nLip and Oral Cavity Cancer  Treatment (Adult)\nOropharyngeal Cancer Treatment (Adult)\nCigarette Smoking:  Health Risks and How to Quit\nLaryngeal Cancer Treatment\nHypopharyngeal Cancer Treatment (Adult)\nGeneral Information About Oral Cavity, Oropharyngeal, Hypopharyngeal, and Laryngeal Cancers\nOral cavity\n,\npharyngeal\n, and\nlaryngeal cancers\nusually form in the\nsquamous cells\n(thin, flat\ncells\nlining the inside of the\noral cavity\n,\npharynx\n, and\nlarynx\n).\nOral cavity cancer forms in any of these\ntissues\nof the oral cavity:\nThe lips.\nThe front two thirds of the tongue.\nThe gingiva (gums).\nThe buccal mucosa (the lining of the inside of the cheeks).\nThe floor (bottom) of the mouth under the tongue.\nThe hard palate (the front, bony part of the roof of the mouth).\nThe retromolar trigone (the small area behind the\nwisdom teeth\n).\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the oral cavity.

The three parts of the larynx are the supraglottis (including the epiglottis), the glottis (including the vocal cords), and the subglottis.\nOral cavity cancer and\noropharyngeal cancer\n: Men are more than twice as likely as women to have oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer and die from it.\nHypopharyngeal cancer\n: Hypopharyngeal cancer is rare. The number of new cases of hypopharyngeal cancer has slightly decreased over the past twenty years. The decrease in new cases is likely because of a decrease in\ncigarette\nsmoking.\nNasopharyngeal cancer\n: Nasopharyngeal cancer is rare in the United States. It is more common in parts of Asia, the Arctic region, North Africa, and the Middle East.\nLaryngeal cancer: Laryngeal cancer is less common than oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in\nSpanish\n.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government\u2019s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers prevention.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the\nPDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board\n.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at\nNCI's website\n.

        "question": "What are the symptoms of Childhood Brain Stem Glioma ?",
        "right_answer": "The signs and symptoms of brain stem glioma are not the same in every child. Signs and symptoms depend on the following:          - Where the tumor forms in the brain.    - The size of the tumor and whether it has spread all through the brain stem.    - How fast the tumor grows.    - The child's age and development.        Some tumors do not cause signs or symptoms. Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood brain stem gliomas or by other conditions. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:         - Loss of ability to move one side of the face and/or body.    - Loss of balance and trouble walking.     - Vision and hearing problems.    - Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting.    -  Nausea and vomiting.    - Unusual sleepiness.    - More or less energy than usual.    - Changes in behavior.    - Trouble learning in school.",
        "context": "Childhood Glioma (Including Astrocytoma)\nGliomas are a group of tumors that arise from glial cells in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Glial cells support and protect the brain's\nnerve cells\n(also called neurons). They hold nerve cells in place, bring food and\noxygen\nto nerve cells, and help protect nerve cells from disease, such as\ninfection\n. Gliomas can form in any area of the CNS and can be low grade or high grade.\nOther types of tumors can form in glial cells and nerve cells. Neuronal tumors are rare tumors made up of nerve cells. Glioneuronal tumors are a mix of nerve cells and glial cells. Neuronal and glioneuronal tumors are rare, low-grade tumors and are treated the same as gliomas.\nAlthough cancer is rare in children, brain tumors are the second most common type of childhood cancer, after leukemia.\nGliomas are most common in these parts of the CNS:\nCerebrum\n, the largest part of the brain, at the top of the head. The cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem-solving, speech, emotions, reading, writing, and voluntary movement.\nCerebellum\n, the lower, back part of the brain (near the middle of the back of the head). The cerebellum controls voluntary movement, balance, and posture.\nBrain stem\n, the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord. The brain stem is in the lowest part of the brain (just above the back of the neck). It controls breathing, heart rate, and the nerves and muscles used in seeing, hearing, walking, talking, and eating.\nHypothalamus\n, the area in the middle of the base of the brain. It controls body\n\t\t  temperature, hunger, and thirst.\nVisual pathway\n, the group of nerves that connect the eye with the brain.\nSpinal cord\n, the column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back. It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called\nmembranes\n. The spinal cord and membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae (back bones). Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body, such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain  to feel  touch.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the brain. The supratentorial area (the upper part of the brain) contains the cerebrum, lateral ventricle and third ventricle (with cerebrospinal fluid shown in blue), choroid plexus, pineal gland, hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and optic nerve.  The posterior fossa/infratentorial area (the lower back part of the brain) contains the cerebellum, tectum, fourth ventricle, and brain stem (midbrain, pons, and medulla).  The skull and meninges protect the brain and spinal cord.\nTypes of glioma, neuronal, and glioneuronal tumors\nAstrocytoma is the most common type of glioma   diagnosed in children. It starts in a type of star-shaped glial cell called an astrocyte. Astrocytomas can form anywhere in the central nervous system.\nOptic pathway glioma is a type of low-grade (slow-growing) glioma that can grow in children with a genetic condition called\nneurofibromatosis type 1\n(NF1).\nThere are many types of astrocytomas, other gliomas, neuronal tumors, and glioneuronal tumors including:\ndiffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma\ninfant-type hemispheric glioma\ndiffuse low-grade glioma\ndiffuse astrocytoma\npilocytic astrocytoma\nhigh-grade astrocytoma with piloid features\npleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma\nsubependymal giant cell astrocytoma\nganglioglioma\ndesmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma/desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma\ndysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor\nDiffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of high-grade glioma that forms in the brain stem and most often occurs in children. To learn more, see\nDiffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma\n.\nEpendymoma is another type of tumor that can form from glial cells, but these tumors are not treated the same as gliomas. To learn more, see\nChildhood Ependymoma\n.\nCauses and risk factors for childhood glioma (including astrocytoma)\nGliomas are caused by certain changes to the way glial cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. Often, the exact cause of cell changes that lead to glioma is unknown. To learn more about how cancer develops, see\nWhat Is Cancer?\nA risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Not every child with a risk factor will develop a glioma, and it will develop in some children who don't have a known risk factor. Inherited genetic disorders that may be risk factors for glioma include:\nneurofibromatosis type 1\ntuberous sclerosis\nTalk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk of a glioma.\nSymptoms of childhood glioma (including astrocytoma)\nThe symptoms of childhood gliomas depend on the following factors:\nwhere the tumor forms in the brain or spinal cord\nthe size of the tumor\nhow fast the tumor grows\nyour child's age and development\nSome tumors do not cause symptoms while other tumors cause symptoms based on their location in the central nervous system. It's important to check with your child's doctor if your child has any symptoms below:\nmorning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting\nnausea and vomiting\nvision, hearing, and speech problems\nloss of balance and trouble walking\nworsening handwriting or slow speech\nweakness or change in feeling on one side of the body\nunusual sleepiness\nmore or less energy than usual\nchange in personality or behavior\nseizures\nweight loss or weight gain for no known reason\nincrease in the size of the head (in infants)\nThese symptoms may be caused by conditions other than childhood gliomas. The only way to know is to see your child's doctor.\nTests to diagnose childhood glioma (including astrocytoma)\nIf your child has symptoms that suggest a central nervous system tumor such as glioma, the doctor will need to find out if they are due to cancer or another condition. The doctor will ask you when the symptoms started and how often your child has been having them. They will also ask about your child's\npersonal\nand\nfamily medical history\nand do a\nphysical exam\n, including a\nneurologic exam\n. Depending on these results, they may recommend tests to find out if your child has a central nervous system tumor.\nThe following tests may be used to diagnose a glioma, neuronal tumor, or glioneuronal tumor. The results will also help you and your child's doctor plan treatment.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with or without gadolinium\nMRI uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord. Sometimes a substance called\ngadolinium\nis\ninjected\ninto a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy\n(MRS) may be done during the same MRI scan to look at the chemical makeup of the brain tissue.\nEnlarge\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry is a laboratory test that uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(markers) in a sample of a patient's tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer. An MIB-1 test is a type of immunohistochemistry that checks tumor tissue for an antigen called MIB-1. This may show how fast a tumor is growing.\nMolecular testing\nA molecular test checks for certain\ngenes\n, proteins, or other molecules in a sample of tissue, blood, or\nbone marrow\n. Molecular tests also check for certain changes in a gene or\nchromosome\nthat may cause or affect the chance of developing a brain tumor. A molecular test may be used to help plan treatment, find out how well treatment is working, or make a\nprognosis\n.\nThe Molecular Characterization Initiative offers free molecular testing to children, adolescents, and young adults with certain types of newly diagnosed cancer. The program is offered through NCI's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative. To learn more, visit\nAbout the Molecular Characterization Initiative\n.\nSurgery to diagnose and possibly remove the glioma\nYour child might have surgery to diagnose or to remove all or part of the glioma. During the surgery, the surgeon removes a part of the skull, which gives an opening to remove the tumor. Sometimes scans are done during the procedure to help the surgeon locate the tumor and remove it. A pathologist will study the tumor under a microscope. If cancer cells are found, the surgeon may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery. The piece of skull is usually put back in place after the procedure.\nEnlarge\nCraniotomy.  An opening is made in the skull and a piece of the skull is removed to show part of the brain.\nSometimes tumors form in a place that makes them hard to remove. If removing the tumor may cause severe physical, emotional, or learning problems, a\nbiopsy\nis done and more treatment is given after the biopsy.\nChildren who have a rare genetic condition called\nneurofibromatosis type 1\nmay be at risk of a low-grade glioma called optic pathway glioma that forms in the area of the brain that controls vision. These children may not need a biopsy to diagnose the tumor. Surgery to remove the tumor may not be needed if the tumor does not grow and symptoms do not occur.\nGetting a second opinion\nYou may want to get a\nsecond opinion\nto confirm your child's diagnosis and treatment plan. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans. They may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another approach, or provide more information about your child's cancer.\nTo learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see\nFinding Cancer Care\n. You can contact\nNCI's Cancer Information Service\nvia chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor or hospital that can provide a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, see\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor about Cancer\n.\nStages and tumor grades of childhood glioma (including astrocytoma)\nStaging is the process of learning the extent of cancer in the body and is often used to help plan treatment and make a prognosis. There is no staging system used for childhood glioma, but it is given a tumor grade. Tumor grading is based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.\nTumor grade describes how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope, how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread within the\ncentral nervous system\n, and how likely the tumor is to come back after treatment.\nThere are four grades of gliomas, but they are most often grouped into low grade (grades I or II) or high grade (grades III or IV):\nLow-grade gliomas grow slowly and do not spread within the brain and spinal cord. But as they grow, they press on nearby healthy areas of the brain, affecting brain function. Most low-grade gliomas are treatable.\nHigh-grade gliomas are fast growing and often spread within the brain and spinal cord, which makes them harder to treat.\nChildhood gliomas usually do not spread to other parts of the body.\nRecurrent glioma\nWhen a glioma comes back after it has been treated it is called a recurrent glioma. A glioma may come back in the same place as the first tumor or in other areas of the brain or spinal cord. Tests will be done to help determine if and where the cancer has returned. The type of treatment that your child will have for recurrent glioma will depend on where it came back.\nSometimes a low-grade glioma can come back as a high-grade glioma. High-grade gliomas often come back within 3 years either in the place where the cancer first formed or somewhere else in the brain or spinal cord.\nProgressive childhood glioma is cancer that continues to grow, spread, or get worse. Progressive disease can be a sign that the cancer no longer responds to treatment.\nTypes of treatment for childhood glioma (including astrocytoma)\nThere are different types of treatment for children and adolescents with glioma. You and your child's cancer care team will work together to decide treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as your child's overall health, the tumor grade, and whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has come back.\nA pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer, will oversee treatment. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. Other specialists may include:\npediatrician\npediatric\nneurosurgeon\nneurologist\nneuropathologist\nneuroradiologist\nrehabilitation specialist\nradiation oncologist\nendocrinologist\npsychologist\nsocial worker\nchild-life specialist\nfertility specialist\nYour child's treatment plan will include information about the cancer, the goals of treatment, treatment options, and the possible side effects. It will be helpful to talk with your child's cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect. For help every step of the way, see our downloadable booklet,\nChildren with Cancer: A Guide for Parents\n.\nSurgery\nSurgery is used to diagnose and treat childhood  gliomas, as discussed in the\nTests to diagnose childhood glioma  (including astrocytoma)\nsection of this summary. After surgery, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is done to see if any cancer cells remain. If cancer cells are found, further treatment depends on:\nwhere the remaining cancer cells are\nthe grade of the tumor\nyour child's age\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some children may be given\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nto kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nSometimes children with a glioma have increased fluid around the brain or spinal cord. They may need surgery to place a shunt (long, thin tube) in a ventricle (fluid-filled space) of the brain and thread it under the skin to another part of the body, usually the abdomen. The shunt carries extra fluid away from the brain so it may be absorbed elsewhere in the body. This decreases the fluid and pressure on the brain or spinal cord. This process is called a CSF shunt.\nEnlarge\nA cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt (a long, thin tube) carries extra CSF away from the brain so it may be absorbed elsewhere in the body. The shunt is placed in a ventricle (fluid-filled space) in  the brain and threaded under the skin to another part of the body, usually the abdomen. The shunt has a valve that controls the flow of CSF.\nObservation\nObservation is closely monitoring a person's condition without giving any treatment or additional treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Observation may be used:\nif your child has no symptoms, such as children with\nneurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)\nif your child's tumor is small and is found when a different health problem is being diagnosed or treated\nafter the tumor is removed by surgery until signs or symptoms appear or change\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy (also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   Chemotherapy may be given alone or with other types of treatment, such as radiation therapy.\nTo treat a glioma, chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a vein. When given this way, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body.  Chemotherapy that may be used includes:\ncarboplatin\nirinotecan\nlenalidomide\nlomustine\nprocarbazine\ntemozolomide\nthioguanine\nvinblastine\nvincristine\nCombinations of these drugs may be used. Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.\nLearn more about\nChemotherapy to Treat Cancer\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. Glioma may be treated with external beam radiation therapy. This type of treatment uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Radiation therapy may be given alone or with other treatments, such as chemotherapy.\nCertain ways of giving external beam radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include:\nConformal radiation therapy\nuses a computer to make a\n3-dimensional\n(3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.\nIntensity-modulated radiation therapy\n(IMRT) uses a computer to make 3-D pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.\nStereotactic radiation therapy\nuses a machine that aims radiation directly at the tumor causing less damage to nearby healthy tissue. The total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days. A rigid head frame is attached to the\nskull\nto keep the head still during the radiation treatment.  This procedure is also called stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotaxic radiation therapy.\nProton beam radiation therapy\nis a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of\nprotons\n(tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells. This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy tissue near a tumor.\nThe way radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor and where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord.\nRadiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development, especially in young children. For children younger than 3 years, chemotherapy may be given instead, to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy. Radiation therapy may also be delayed for patients with NF1 because they may be at increased risk for a second cancer.\nTo learn more, see\nExternal Beam Radiation Therapy for Cancer\nand\nRadiation Therapy Side Effects\n.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy uses drugs or other substances to block the action of specific enzymes, proteins, or other molecules involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells.\nTargeted therapies that may be used or are being studied to treat glioma include:\nbevacizumab\ndabrafenib\neverolimus\nlarotrectinib\nselumetinib\nsirolimus\ntrametinib\nLearn more about\nTargeted Therapy to Treat Cancer\n.\nClinical trials\nA treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for people with cancer. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.\nUse our\nclinical trials search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nTo learn more, see\nClinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy helps a person's immune system fight cancer.\nThe following treatments are being studied to treat glioma:\noncolytic virus therapy\nchimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy\ndrugs that block the activity of\nPD-1\nLearn more about how immunotherapy works against cancer, how it is given, and possible side effects, and more in\nImmunotherapy to Treat Cancer\n.\nTreatment of newly diagnosed childhood low-grade glioma, astrocytoma, neuronal, and glioneuronal tumors\nChildren with\nneurofibromatosis type 1\nand a\ncentral nervous system tumor\n, children with an\noptic pathway glioma\n, or children who had a tumor found when getting a scan for another health problem may be observed (closely watched). These children may not receive treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change or the tumor grows.\nChildren with tuberous sclerosis may develop low-grade tumors in the brain called\nsubependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGAs)\n.\nTargeted therapy\nwith\neverolimus\nor\nsirolimus\nmay be used instead of surgery, to shrink the tumors.\nChildren diagnosed with low-grade glioma are treated based on where the tumor is located. The first treatment is usually surgery. An MRI is done after surgery to see if any tumor remains. If the tumor was completely removed by surgery, more treatment may not be needed and the child is closely observed.\nIf there is tumor remaining after surgery, treatment may include:\nobservation for children who had surgery to remove part of the tumor and the tumor is expected to regrow slowly\ncombination chemotherapy\nwith or without radiation therapy\nradiation therapy, which may include\nconformal radiation therapy\n,\nintensity-modulated radiation therapy\n,\nproton beam radiation therapy\n, or\nstereotactic radiation therapy\n, may be used if the tumor does not respond to chemotherapy or when the tumor begins to grow again\ntargeted therapy (\ntrametinib\nand\ndabrafenib\n)\na clinical trial of targeted therapy (\nselumetinib\n) with or without chemotherapy\nTo learn more about these treatments, see\nTypes of treatment for childhood glioma (including astrocytoma)\n.\nTreatment of progressive or recurrent childhood low-grade glioma, astrocytoma, neuronal, or glioneuronal tumors\nChildhood glioma, astrocytoma, glioneuronal, and neuronal tumors can be\nprogressive\nor\nrecurrent\n. They most often come back in the same area but can spread to other areas in the brain.  Before more cancer treatment is given, imaging tests, biopsy, or surgery are done to find out if there is cancer, how much there is, and the grade.\nTreatment of progressive or recurrent childhood\nlow-grade\nglioma\n,\nastrocytoma\n, glioneuronal, and neuronal tumors may include:\na second surgery to remove the tumor\nradiation therapy (including conformal radiation therapy), if radiation therapy was not used when the tumor was first diagnosed\nchemotherapy, if the tumor progressed or recurred where it cannot be removed by surgery\ntargeted therapy (\nbevacizumab\n) with or without chemotherapy\ntargeted therapy (\neverolimus\nor\nsirolimus\n)\ntargeted therapy (\ndabrafenib\nand\ntrametinib\n)\nTo learn more about these treatments, see\nTypes of treatment for childhood glioma (including astrocytoma)\n.\nTreatment of childhood high-grade gliomas\nTreatment of  newly diagnosed childhood\nhigh-grade\nglioma\nmay include:\nsurgery to remove the tumor\nradiation therapy with or without chemotherapy\na clinical trial of targeted therapy with a combination of\ndabrafenib\nand\ntrametinib\nafter radiation therapy to treat newly diagnosed high-grade glioma that has\nmutations\nin the\nBRAF\ngene\na clinical trial of immunotherapy\nTo learn more about these treatments, see\nTypes of treatment for childhood glioma (including astrocytoma)\n.\nTreatment of recurrent childhood high-grade gliomas\nTreatment of\nrecurrent\nchildhood\nhigh-grade\nglioma\nmay include:\nsecond surgery depending on tumor type, location, and length of time between treatment and recurrence\nradiation therapy\ntargeted therapy (\ndabrafenib\nand\ntrametinib\n)\na clinical trial of targeted therapy\na clinical trial of\nimmunotherapy\nTo learn more about these treatments, see\nTypes of treatment for childhood glioma (including astrocytoma)\n.\nPrognosis and prognostic factors for childhood glioma (including astrocytoma)\nIf your child has been diagnosed with a glioma, you likely have questions about how serious the cancer is and your child's chances of survival. The likely outcome or course of a disease is called prognosis.\nThe prognosis depends on many factors, including:\nwhether the tumor is a low-grade or high-grade glioma\nwhere the tumor has formed in the central nervous system and if it has spread within the central nervous system or to other parts of the body\nhow fast the tumor is growing\nyour child's age\nwhether cancer cells remain after surgery\nwhether there are changes in certain genes such as\nBRAF\nwhether your child has NF1 or tuberous sclerosis\nwhether your child has diencephalic syndrome, a condition which slows physical growth\nwhether the glioma has just been diagnosed or has come back after treatment\nChildren with a low-grade glioma, astrocytoma, neuronal tumor, or glioneuronal tumor have a relatively favorable prognosis if the tumor can be removed by surgery.\nChildren with a high-grade glioma have a poor prognosis. Some children diagnosed with a high-grade glioma, particularly infants younger than 1 year, may have tumors with certain fusion genes. Infants with a high-grade glioma whose tumors show these genetic changes may have a better prognosis than older children with a high-grade glioma.\nFor glioma that has come back after treatment, prognosis and treatment depend on how much time passed between the time treatment ended and the time the glioma came back.\nNo two people are alike, and responses to treatment can vary greatly. Your child's cancer care team is in the best position to talk with you about your child's prognosis.\nSide effects from the tumor and treatment\nThe signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis and continue for months or years. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nProblems from cancer treatment that begin 6 months or later after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include:\nphysical problems that affect:\nvision, including blindness\nblood vessels\nhormone\nlevels\nchanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory\nsecond cancers (new types of cancer)\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. To learn more, see\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\n.\nFollow-up care\nAs your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or checkups. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nRegular MRIs will continue to be done after treatment has ended. The results of the MRI can show if your child's condition has changed or if the glioma has come back. If the results of the MRI show a mass in the brain, a biopsy may be done to find out if it is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing.\nChildren who received radiation therapy to treat an optic pathway glioma are at risk of developing vision changes. These changes are most likely to occur within 2 years after radiation therapy. The effect of tumor growth and treatment on the child's vision will be closely followed during and after treatment.\nCoping with your child's cancer\nWhen your child has cancer, every member of the family needs support. Taking care of yourself during this time is important. Reach out to your child's treatment team and to people in your family and community for support. To learn more, see\nSupport for Families When a Child Has Cancer\nand\nChildren with Cancer: A Guide for Parents\n.\nRelated resources\nFor more childhood cancer information and other general cancer resources, see:\nPediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC)\nAbout Cancer\nChildhood Cancers\nCureSearch for Children's Cancer\nAdolescents and Young Adults with Cancer\nCancer in Children and Adolescents\nFor Survivors and Caregivers\nUpdated:\nMay 10, 2024\nIf you would like to reproduce some or all of this content, see\nReuse of NCI Information\nfor guidance about copyright and permissions.

        "question": "Who is at risk for Small Intestine Cancer? ?",
        "right_answer": "Diet and health history can affect the risk of developing small intestine cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for small intestine cancer include the following:         - Eating a high-fat diet.    - Having Crohn disease.     - Having celiac disease.    -  Having familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).",
        "context": "Small Intestine Cancer Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Small  Intestine Cancer\nKey Points\nSmall  intestine cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the small  intestine.\nThere are  five types of small intestine cancer.\nDiet and health history can affect the risk of developing small  intestine cancer.\nSigns and symptoms of small  intestine cancer include unexplained weight loss and abdominal pain.\nTests that examine the small intestine are used to diagnose and stage small  intestine cancer.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nSmall  intestine cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the small  intestine.\nThe\nsmall intestine\nis part of the\n\t\t  body\u2019s\ndigestive system\n, which also includes the\nesophagus\n,\nstomach\n, and\nlarge\n\t\t  intestine\n.  The\n\t\t  digestive system removes and processes\nnutrients\n(\nvitamins\n,\nminerals\n,\ncarbohydrates\n, fats,\nproteins\n, and water) from foods and helps pass waste\n\t\t  material out of the body. The small intestine is a long tube that connects the stomach to the large intestine.   It folds many times to fit inside the\nabdomen\n.\nEnlarge\nThe small intestine is a long tube-like organ that connects the stomach to the large intestine. The small intestine includes the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.\nThere are  five types of small intestine cancer.\nThe types of\ncancer\nfound in the small intestine are\nadenocarcinoma\n,\nsarcoma\n,\nneuroendocrine tumors\n,\ngastrointestinal stromal tumor\n, and\nlymphoma\n. This summary discusses adenocarcinoma and\nleiomyosarcoma\n(a type of  sarcoma).\nAdenocarcinoma starts in\nglandular\ncells\nin the lining of the small intestine and is the most common type of\nsmall intestine cancer\n. Most of these\ntumors\noccur in the part of the small intestine near the stomach. They may grow and block the intestine.\nLeiomyosarcoma starts in the smooth muscle cells of the small intestine. Most of these tumors occur in the part of the small intestine near the large intestine.\nFor more information on small intestine cancer, see the following:\nGastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors Treatment\nGastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Treatment\nDiet and health history can affect the risk of developing small  intestine cancer.\nAnything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called \n         a\nrisk factor\n.  Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop small intestine cancer, and it will develop in some people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.  Risk factors for small intestine cancer include the following:\nEating a  high-fat\ndiet\n.\nHaving\nCrohn disease\n.\nHaving\nceliac disease\n.\nHaving\nfamilial adenomatous polyposis\n(FAP).\nSigns and symptoms of small  intestine cancer include unexplained weight loss and abdominal pain.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by small  intestine cancer or by other\nconditions\n.  Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nPain or cramps in the middle of the abdomen.\nWeight loss with no known reason.\nA lump in the abdomen.\nBlood\nin the\nstool\n.\nTests that examine the small intestine are used to diagnose and stage small  intestine cancer.\nProcedures\n\t\t  that make pictures of the small intestine and the area around it help\ndiagnose\nsmall intestine cancer and show how far the cancer has spread. The process used\n\t\t  to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the small intestine is\n\t\t  called\nstaging\n.\nIn order to plan treatment, it is important to know  the type of small intestine cancer and whether the tumor can be removed by\nsurgery\n. Tests and procedures\n\t\t  to detect, diagnose, and\nstage\nsmall intestine cancer are usually done at the same\n\t\t  time. In addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by\norgans\nand\ntissues\nin the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nLiver function tests\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the\nliver\n.  A higher than normal amount of a substance can  be a sign of liver disease that may be caused by small intestine cancer.\nEndoscopy\n:  A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for\nabnormal\nareas. There are different types of endoscopy:\nUpper endoscopy\n: A procedure to look at the inside of the esophagus, stomach, and\nduodenum\n(first part of the small intestine, near the stomach). An\nendoscope\nis inserted  through the mouth and into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.  An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a\nlens\nfor viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor signs of cancer.\nCapsule endoscopy\n: A procedure to look at the inside of the small intestine. A capsule that is about the size of a large pill and contains a light and a tiny wireless camera is swallowed by the patient. The capsule travels through the\ndigestive tract\n, including the small intestine, and sends many pictures of the inside of the digestive tract to a recorder that is worn around the waist or over the shoulder. The pictures are sent from the recorder to a computer and viewed by the doctor who checks for signs of cancer. The capsule passes out of the body during a\nbowel movement\n.\nDouble balloon endoscopy\n: A procedure to look at the inside of the small intestine. A special instrument made up of two tubes (one inside the other) is inserted through the mouth or\nrectum\nand into the small intestine. The inside  tube (an endoscope with a light and lens for viewing) is moved through part of the small intestine and a balloon at the end of it is inflated to keep the endoscope in place. Next, the outer tube is moved through the small intestine to reach the end of the endoscope, and a balloon at the end of the outer tube is inflated to keep it in place. Then, the balloon at the end of the endoscope is deflated and the endoscope is moved through the next part of the small intestine. These steps are repeated many times as the tubes move through the small intestine. The doctor is able to see the inside of the small intestine through the endoscope and use a tool to remove samples of abnormal tissue. The tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure may be done if the results of a capsule endoscopy are abnormal. This procedure is also called double balloon enteroscopy.\nLaparotomy\n: A\nsurgical\nprocedure in which an\nincision\n(cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. Sometimes organs or\nlymph nodes\nare removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease.\nBiopsy\n: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed   under a microscope to check for signs of cancer.  This may be done during an endoscopy or laparotomy.  The  sample is checked by a\npathologist\nto see if it contains cancer cells.\nUpper GI series\nwith small\nbowel\nfollow-through\n: A series of\nx-rays\nof the esophagus, stomach, and  small bowel.  The patient drinks a liquid that contains\nbarium\n(a silver-white\nmetallic\ncompound\n).  The liquid coats the esophagus, stomach, and  small bowel.  X-rays are  taken at different times as the barium travels through the upper\nGI tract\nand small bowel.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n:  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe type of small intestine cancer.\nWhether the cancer is in the inner lining of the small intestine only or has spread into or beyond the wall of the small intestine.\nWhether the cancer has spread to other places in the body, such as the lymph nodes, liver, or\nperitoneum\n(tissue that lines the wall of the abdomen and covers most of the organs in the abdomen).\nWhether the cancer can be completely removed by\nsurgery\n.\nWhether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has\nrecurred\n.\nStages of Small  Intestine Cancer\nKey Points\nTests and procedures to stage small intestine cancer are  usually done at the same time as diagnosis.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nSmall intestine cancer is  grouped according to whether or not the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.\nSmall intestine cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nTests and procedures to stage small intestine cancer are  usually done at the same time as diagnosis.\nStaging\nis used to find out how far the\ncancer\nhas spread, but treatment decisions are not based on\nstage\n. See the\nGeneral Information\nsection for a description of tests and procedures used to detect,\ndiagnose\n, and stage\nsmall intestine\ncancer.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  small intestine cancer spreads to the\nliver\n, the cancer cells in the liver are actually small intestine cancer cells. The disease is metastatic small intestine cancer, not\nliver cancer\n.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nSmall intestine cancer is  grouped according to whether or not the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.\nTreatment depends on whether the\ntumor\ncan be removed by\nsurgery\nand if the cancer is being treated as a\nprimary tumor\nor is\nmetastatic cancer\n.\nSmall intestine cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nThe cancer may come back in the small intestine or in other parts of the body.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with small  intestine cancer.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nImmunotherapy\nRadiation therapy with radiosensitizers\nTreatment for small intestine cancer may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with small  intestine cancer.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for patients with\nsmall  intestine\ncancer\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the   standard treatment,  the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery\nis the most common treatment of small intestine cancer.\n\t\t\t One of the following types of surgery may be done:\nResection\n:  Surgery to remove part or all of an\norgan\nthat contains cancer. The resection may include the small intestine and nearby organs (if the cancer has spread). The doctor may remove the section of the  small intestine that contains cancer and perform an\nanastomosis\n(joining the cut ends of the intestine\n\t\t\t\ttogether). The doctor will usually remove\nlymph nodes\nnear the small intestine and examine them under\n\t\t\t\ta\nmicroscope\nto see whether they contain cancer.\nBypass\n: Surgery to allow food in the small intestine to go around (bypass) a\ntumor\nthat is blocking the intestine but cannot be removed.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given\nradiation therapy\nafter surgery to kill any cancer\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nExternal radiation therapy is used to treat small intestine cancer.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient's\nimmune system\nto fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.\nRadiation therapy with radiosensitizers\nRadiosensitizers\nare drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells.\nTreatment for small intestine cancer may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Small Intestine Adenocarcinoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nWhen possible, treatment of\nsmall  intestine\nadenocarcinoma\nwill be\nsurgery\nto remove the\ntumor\nand some of the normal\ntissue\naround it.\nTreatment of small  intestine adenocarcinoma that cannot be removed by surgery may include the following:\nSurgery to\nbypass\nthe tumor.\nRadiation therapy\nas\npalliative therapy\nto relieve\nsymptoms\nand improve the patient's\nquality of life\n.\nA\nclinical trial\nof radiation therapy with\nradiosensitizers\n, with or without\nchemotherapy\n.\nA clinical trial of new anticancer\ndrugs\n.\nA clinical trial of\nimmunotherapy\n.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\n                \n                \n                    Five types of standard treatment are used:\n                    Surgery     Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for endometrial cancer. The following surgical procedures may be used:             -  Total hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, including the cervix. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.     -  Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.     -  Radical hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and part of the vagina. The ovaries, fallopian tubes, or nearby lymph nodes may also be removed.     -  Lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.           Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy or hormone treatment after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.        Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat endometrial cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.       Hormone therapy      Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.\n                \n                \n                    Targeted therapy\n                    Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibodies, mTOR inhibitors, and signal transduction inhibitors are three types of targeted therapy used to treat endometrial cancer.         - Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Bevacizumab is used to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.    - mTOR inhibitors block a protein called mTOR, which helps control cell division. mTOR inhibitors may keep cancer cells from growing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Everolimus and ridaforalimus are used to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.    - Signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. Metformin is being studied to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.\n                \n                \n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\n                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.\n                \n                \n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\n                \n                \n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.\n                \n                \n                    Follow-up tests may be needed.\n                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.\n                \n\t\t        \n\t\t            Treatment Options by Stage\n\t\t            \n\t\t                \n\t\t                    Stage I and Stage II Endometrial Cancer\n\t\t                    Low-risk endometrial cancer (grade 1 or grade 2)    Treatment of low-risk stage I endometrial cancer and stage II endometrial cancer may include the following:         -  Surgery (total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). Lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen may also be removed and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells.    - Surgery (total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, with or without removal of lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen) followed by internal radiation therapy. In certain cases, external radiation therapy to the pelvis may be used in place of internal radiation therapy.    -  Radiation therapy alone for patients who cannot have surgery.    - A clinical trial of a new chemotherapy regimen.        If cancer has spread to the cervix, a radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be done.    High-risk endometrial cancer (grade 3)    Treatment of high-risk stage I endometrial cancer and stage II endometrial cancer may include the following:         -  Surgery (radical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). Lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen may also be removed and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells.    - Surgery (radical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) followed by chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy.    - A clinical trial of a new chemotherapy regimen.

The uterus is where a\nfetus\ngrows. In most nonpregnant\n\t\t  women, the uterus is about 3 inches long. The lower, narrow end of the uterus is the\ncervix\n, which leads  to the\nvagina\n.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium.\nCancer\nof the endometrium\n\t\t  is different from cancer of the muscle of the uterus, which is called\nsarcoma\nof the uterus. See the\nPDQ\nsummary on\nUterine Sarcoma Treatment\nfor more information about\nuterine sarcoma\n.\nObesity and having metabolic syndrome may increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nAnything that increases your chance of getting a disease\n\t\t  is called a\nrisk factor\n. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get\ncancer\n; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for\nendometrial cancer\n.\nRisk factors for endometrial cancer include the following:\nTaking\nestrogen-only hormone replacement therapy\n(HRT) after\nmenopause\n.\nTaking\ntamoxifen\nto\nprevent\nor treat\nbreast cancer\n.\nObesity\n.\nHaving\nmetabolic syndrome\n.\nHaving type 2\ndiabetes\n.\nExposure of endometrial\ntissue\nto\nestrogen\nmade by the body. This may be caused by:\nNever giving birth.\nMenstruating\nat an early age.\nStarting menopause at a later age.\nHaving\npolycystic ovary syndrome\n.\nHaving a\nfamily history\nof endometrial cancer in a\nfirst-degree relative\n(mother, sister, or daughter).\nHaving certain\ngenetic\nconditions\n, such as\nLynch syndrome\n.\nHaving\nendometrial hyperplasia\n.\nOlder age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.\nTaking tamoxifen for breast cancer or taking estrogen alone\n\t\t  (without progesterone) can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nEndometrial cancer\nmay develop in\nbreast cancer\npatients who have\n\t\t  been treated with\ntamoxifen\n. A\n\t\t  patient who takes this\ndrug\nand has\nabnormal\nvaginal\nbleeding should have a\nfollow-up\nexam and a\nbiopsy\nof the\nendometrial\nlining if needed. Women taking\nestrogen\n(a\nhormone\nthat can affect      the growth\n\t\t  of some cancers) alone also have an increased risk of endometrial cancer.\n\t\t  Taking estrogen combined with\nprogesterone\n(another hormone) does not increase a\n\t\t  woman\u2019s risk of endometrial cancer.\nSigns and symptoms of endometrial cancer include unusual vaginal\n\t\t  bleeding or pain in the pelvis.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by endometrial cancer or by other conditions.\n\t\t   Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nVaginal bleeding or\ndischarge\nnot related to\n\t\t\t menstruation (periods).\nVaginal bleeding after menopause.\nDifficult or painful\nurination\n.\nPain during sexual intercourse.\nPain in the\npelvic\narea.\nTests that examine the endometrium are used to diagnose\n\t\t   endometrial cancer.\nBecause endometrial cancer begins inside the uterus, it does not\n\t\t  usually show up in the results of a\nPap\n\t\t  test\n. For this reason, a sample of endometrial\ntissue\nmust be removed and checked\n\t\t  under a\nmicroscope\nto look for cancer\ncells\n. One of the following procedures may be\n\t\t  used:\nEndometrial biopsy\n: The removal of tissue from the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) by inserting a thin, flexible tube through the cervix and into the uterus.  The tube is used to gently scrape a small amount of tissue from the endometrium and then remove the tissue samples.  A\npathologist\nviews the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.\nDilatation and curettage\n:  A procedure to remove samples of tissue from the inner lining of the uterus.  The cervix is\ndilated\nand a\ncurette\n(spoon-shaped instrument) is inserted into the uterus to remove tissue.   The tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of disease.  This procedure is also called a D&C.\nEnlarge\nDilatation and curettage (D and C). A speculum is inserted into the vagina to widen it in order to look at the cervix (first panel). A dilator is used to widen the cervix (middle panel). A curette is put through the cervix into the uterus to scrape out abnormal tissue (last panel).\nHysteroscopy\n: A procedure to look inside the uterus for abnormal areas. A hysteroscope is inserted through the vagina and cervix into the uterus. A hysteroscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a\nlens\nfor viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.\nOther tests and procedures used to\ndiagnose\nendometrial cancer include the following:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient\u2019s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nTransvaginal ultrasound\nexam\n: A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus,\nfallopian tubes\n, and\nbladder\n. An\nultrasound transducer\n(probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. The doctor can identify\ntumors\nby looking at the sonogram.\nEnlarge\nTransvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe\nstage\nof the cancer (whether it is in the endometrium only, involves the uterus wall, or has spread to other places in the body).\nHow the cancer cells look under a microscope.\nWhether the cancer cells are affected by progesterone.\nEndometrial cancer can usually be\ncured\nbecause it is usually diagnosed early.\nStages of Endometrial Cancer\nKey Points\nAfter endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are\n\t\t  done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other\n\t\t  parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for endometrial\n\t\t  cancer:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nEndometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:\nLow-risk endometrial cancer\nHigh-risk endometrial cancer\nEndometrial cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nAfter endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are\n\t\t  done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other\n\t\t  parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out whether the\ncancer\nhas spread within the\nuterus\nor to other parts of the body\n\t\t  is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the\n\t\t  staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important\n\t\t  to know the stage  in\n\t\t  order to plan treatment. Certain tests and procedures are used in the staging process. A\nhysterectomy\n(an operation in\n\t\t  which the uterus is removed) will usually be done to treat\nendometrial cancer\n.\nTissue\nsamples are taken from the area around the uterus and checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor\nsigns\nof cancer to help find out whether the\n\t\t  cancer has spread.\nThe following procedures may be used in the staging process:\nPelvic exam\n: An exam of the\nvagina\n,\ncervix\n, uterus,\nfallopian tubes\n,\novaries\n, and\nrectum\n.    A\nspeculum\nis inserted into the vagina and the doctor or\nnurse\nlooks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A\nPap test\nof the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two\nlubricated\n, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower\nabdomen\nto feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or\nabnormal\nareas.\nEnlarge\nPelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.\nChest x-ray\n: An\nx-ray\nof the\norgans\nand bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor\ncells\nin the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nLymph node dissection\n: A surgical procedure in which the\nlymph nodes\nare removed from the\npelvic\narea and  a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  endometrial cancer spreads to the\nlung\n, the cancer cells in the lung are actually endometrial cancer cells. The disease is metastatic endometrial cancer, not lung cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for endometrial\n\t\t  cancer:\nStage I\nEnlarge\nStage IA and stage IB endometrial cancer. In stage IA, cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (the muscle layer of the uterus). In stage IB, cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium.\nIn\nstage I\n,\ncancer\nis\n\t\t\t found in the\nuterus\nonly.  Stage I is divided\n\t\t\t into stages IA and IB, based on how far the cancer has spread.\nStage IA\n:\nCancer\nis in the\nendometrium\nonly or less than halfway through the\nmyometrium\n(muscle layer of the\nuterus\n).\nStage IB\n:\nCancer\nhas spread halfway or more into the\nmyometrium\n.\nStage II\nEnlarge\nStage II endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus.\nIn\nstage II\n,\ncancer\nhas spread into\nconnective tissue\nof the\ncervix\n, but has not spread outside the\nuterus\n.\nStage III\nIn\nstage III\n,\ncancer\nhas spread beyond the\nuterus\nand\ncervix\n, but has not spread beyond the\npelvis\n. Stage III is divided into\n\t\t\t stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, based on  how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis.\nStage IIIA\n:\nCancer\nhas spread to the outer layer of the\nuterus\nand/or to the\nfallopian tubes\n,\novaries\n, and ligaments of the uterus.\nEnlarge\nStage IIIA endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, or ligaments of the uterus.\nStage IIIB\n:\nCancer\nhas spread to the\nvagina\nand/or to the\nparametrium\n(\nconnective tissue\nand fat around the\nuterus\n).\nEnlarge\nStage IIIB endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread to the vagina and/or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the uterus and cervix).\nStage IIIC\n:\nCancer\nhas spread to\nlymph nodes\nin the\npelvis\nand/or around the\naorta\n(largest\nartery\nin the body, which carries\nblood\naway from the heart).\nEnlarge\nStage IIIC endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (the largest artery in the body that carries blood away from the heart).\nStage IV\nIn\nstage IV\n,\ncancer\nhas spread beyond the\npelvis\n. Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB,\n\t\t\t based on  how far the cancer has spread.\nStage IVA\n:\nCancer\nhas spread to the\nbladder\nand/or\nbowel\nwall.\nEnlarge\nStage IVA endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread into the bladder and/or bowel.\nStage IVB\n:\nCancer\nhas spread to other parts of the body beyond the\npelvis\n, including the\nabdomen\nand/or\nlymph nodes\nin the\ngroin\n.\nEnlarge\nStage IVB endometrial cancer. The cancer has spread to parts of the body outside the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin.\nEndometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:\nLow-risk endometrial cancer\nGrades\n1 and 2\ntumors\nare usually considered low-risk.  They  usually do not spread to other parts of the body.\nHigh-risk endometrial cancer\nGrade\n3\ntumors\nare considered high-risk.  They often spread to other parts of the body. Uterine\npapillary serous\n,\nclear cell\n, and\ncarcinosarcoma\nare three subtypes of\nendometrial cancer\nthat are considered grade 3.\nEndometrial cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nThe cancer may come back in the\nuterus\n, the\npelvis\n, in\nlymph nodes\nin the\nabdomen\n, or in other parts of the\n\t\tbody.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial\n\t\t  cancer.\nFive types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nHormone therapy\nTargeted therapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nTreatment for endometrial cancer may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial\n\t\t  cancer.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\nendometrial\n\t\t  cancer\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some\n\t\t  are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.\n\t\t  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help\n\t\t  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients\n\t\t  with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nFive types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery\n(removing the cancer in\n\t\t\t an operation) is the most common treatment for endometrial cancer. The\n\t\t\t following surgical procedures may be used:\nTotal hysterectomy\n: Surgery to remove the\nuterus\n, including the\ncervix\n.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the\nvagina\n, the operation is called a\nvaginal\nhysterectomy\n.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large\nincision\n(cut) in the\nabdomen\n, the operation is called a total\nabdominal\nhysterectomy.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a\nlaparoscope\n, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.\nEnlarge\nHysterectomy. The uterus is surgically removed with or without other organs or tissues. In a total hysterectomy, the uterus and cervix are removed. In a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy, (a) the uterus plus one (unilateral) ovary and fallopian tube are removed; or (b) the uterus plus both (bilateral) ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed. In a radical hysterectomy, the uterus, cervix, both ovaries, both fallopian tubes, and nearby tissue are removed. These procedures are done using a low transverse incision or a vertical incision.\nBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n: Surgery to remove both\novaries\nand both\nfallopian\n\t\t\t\ttubes\n.\nRadical hysterectomy\n: Surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and part of the vagina.  The ovaries, fallopian tubes, or nearby\nlymph nodes\nmay also be removed.\nLymph node dissection\n: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the\npelvic\narea and  a sample of\ntissue\nis checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor\nsigns\nof cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the\n\t\t\t time of the  surgery, some patients may be given\nradiation therapy\nor\nhormone treatment\nafter surgery to kill any cancer\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given\n\t\t\t after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer.\nThe way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and\nstage\nof the cancer being treated.  External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat endometrial cancer, and may also be used as\npalliative therapy\nto relieve\nsymptoms\nand improve\nquality of life\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n, an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n).\nThe way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.\nHormone therapy\nHormone therapy\nis a cancer treatment that removes\nhormones\nor blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are  substances made by\nglands\nin the body and circulated in the bloodstream.          Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (\nreceptors\n),\ndrugs\n, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.\nMonoclonal antibodies\n,\nmTOR inhibitors\n, and\nsignal transduction inhibitors\nare three types of targeted therapy used to treat endometrial cancer.\nMonoclonal antibody therapy: Monoclonal\nantibodies\nare\nimmune system\nproteins\nmade in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these antibodies can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by\ninfusion\n. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.\nBevacizumab\nis used to treat\nstage III\n,\nstage IV\n, and\nrecurrent\nendometrial cancer.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body\u2019s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nmTOR inhibitor therapy: mTOR inhibitors block a protein called\nmTOR\n, which helps control cell division. mTOR inhibitors may keep cancer cells from growing and\nprevent\nthe growth of new\nblood vessels\nthat\ntumors\nneed to grow.\nEverolimus\nand ridaforolimus are used to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.\nSignal transduction inhibitor therapy: Signal transduction inhibitors block\nsignals\nthat are passed from one\nmolecule\nto another inside a cell. Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells.\nMetformin\nis being studied to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nInformation about\nclinical trials\nis available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for endometrial cancer may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Stage I and Stage II Endometrial Cancer\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nLow-risk endometrial cancer (grade 1 or grade 2)\nTreatment of low-risk\nstage I endometrial cancer\nand\nstage II endometrial cancer\nmay include the following:\nSurgery\n(\ntotal hysterectomy\nand\nbilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n).\nLymph nodes\nin the\npelvis\nand\nabdomen\nmay also be removed and viewed under a\nmicroscope\nto check for\ncancer\ncells\n.\nSurgery (total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, with or\n\t\t\t without removal of lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen) followed by\ninternal radiation therapy\n.

        "context": "Prostate Cancer Screening (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nWhat is screening?\nScreening\nis  looking for\ncancer\nbefore a person has any\nsymptoms\n. This can help find\n\t\tcancer at an early\nstage\n. When\nabnormal\ntissue\nor cancer is found early, it may\n\t\tbe easier to treat. By the time symptoms  appear, cancer may have begun\n\t\tto  spread.\nScientists\nare trying to better understand which\n\t\tpeople are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things\n\t\twe do and the things around us to see if they cause  cancer. This\n\t\tinformation helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which\n\t\tscreening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done.\nIt is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily\n\t\tthink you have cancer if he or she suggests a  screening test. Screening\n\t\ttests are given when you  have no cancer symptoms. Screening tests may be repeated on a regular basis.\nIf a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called\ndiagnostic tests\n.\nGeneral Information About Prostate Cancer\nKey Points\nProstate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the tissues of the prostate.\nProstate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer among men in\n\t\t  the United States.\nDifferent factors increase or decrease the risk of developing prostate cancer.\nProstate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the tissues of the prostate.\nThe\nprostate\nis a\ngland\nin the male\nreproductive system\nlocated just\n\t\t  below the\nbladder\n(the\norgan\nthat\n\t\t  collects and empties\nurine\n) and in\n\t\t  front of the\nrectum\n(the lower part\n\t\t  of the\nintestine\n).

A normal prostate does not block the flow of urine from the bladder. An enlarged prostate  presses on the bladder and urethra and blocks the flow of urine.\nSee the following\nPDQ\nsummaries for more information about prostate cancer:\nProstate Cancer Prevention\nProstate Cancer Treatment\nProstate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer among men in\n\t\t  the United States.\nProstate cancer is found mainly in older men. In the United States, about one  out of every 8 men will be\ndiagnosed\nwith prostate cancer. Most men diagnosed with this disease do not die from it.    Prostate cancer causes  more deaths in men than any other cancer except\nlung cancer\n. Prostate cancer occurs more often in African American men than in White men. African American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than White men with prostate cancer.\nDifferent factors increase or decrease the risk of developing prostate cancer.\nAnything that increases a person's chance of developing a disease\n\t\t  is called a\nrisk factor\n. Anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a\nprotective factor\n.\nFor information about risk factors and protective factors for prostate cancer, see\nProstate Cancer Prevention\n.\nProstate Cancer Screening\nKey Points\nTests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.\nThere is no standard or routine screening test for prostate cancer.\nDigital rectal exam\nProstate-specific antigen test\nA prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) RNA test may be used for certain patients.\nScreening tests for prostate cancer are being studied in clinical trials.\nTests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.\nScientists\nstudy\nscreening\ntests to find those with the fewest harms and most benefits.\nCancer\nscreening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes\nsymptoms\n)  helps a person live longer or decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, the chance of\nrecovery\nis better if the disease is found and treated at an early\nstage\n.\nThere is no standard or routine screening test for prostate cancer.\nAlthough there are no standard or routine screening tests for\nprostate cancer\n, the following tests are being used or studied to screen for it:\nDigital rectal exam\nDigital rectal exam\n(DRE) is an exam of the\nrectum\n. The doctor or\nnurse\ninserts a\nlubricated\n, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel the\nprostate\nfor lumps or anything else that seems unusual.\nEnlarge\nDigital rectal exam (DRE). The doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum and feels the rectum, anus, and prostate (in males) to check for anything abnormal.\nProstate-specific antigen test\nA\nprostate-specific antigen (PSA) test\nis a test that measures the level of\nPSA\nin the\nblood\n.  PSA is a substance made mostly by the prostate that may be found in an increased amount in the blood of men who have prostate cancer.  The level of PSA may also be high in men who have an\ninfection\nor\ninflammation\nof the prostate or\nbenign prostatic hyperplasia\n(BPH; an enlarged, but noncancerous, prostate).\nA PSA test or a DRE may be able to detect prostate cancer at an early stage, but it is not clear whether  early detection and treatment decrease the risk of dying from prostate cancer.\nStudies are being done to find ways to make PSA testing more accurate for early cancer detection.\nA prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) RNA test may be used for certain patients.\nIf a man had a high PSA level and a\nbiopsy\nof the prostate did not show cancer and the PSA level remains high after the biopsy, a prostate cancer\ngene\n3 (PCA3) RNA test may be done. This test measures the amount of PCA3 RNA in the\nurine\nafter a DRE. If the PCA3 RNA level is higher than normal, another biopsy may help\ndiagnose\nprostate cancer.\nScreening tests for prostate cancer are being studied in clinical trials.\nInformation about\nclinical trials\nsupported by\nNCI\ncan be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nRisks of Prostate Cancer Screening\nKey Points\nScreening tests have risks.\nThe risks of prostate screening include the\n\t\t  following:\nFinding prostate cancer may not improve health or help a man live\n\t\t\t longer.\nFollow-up tests, such as a biopsy, may be done to diagnose cancer.\nFalse-negative test results can occur.\nFalse-positive test results can occur.\nScreening tests have risks.\nDecisions about\nscreening\ntests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may\n\t\t  want to discuss  the test with your doctor.  It is important to know the risks of\n\t\t  the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from\ncancer\n.\nThe risks of prostate screening include the\n\t\t  following:\nFinding prostate cancer may not improve health or help a man live\n\t\t\t longer.\nScreening\n\t\t\t may not improve your health or help  you live longer if  you have      cancer that has already spread to the area outside of the\nprostate\nor to\n\t\t\t other places in  your body.\nSome cancers  never  cause\nsymptoms\nor become life-threatening, but if    found by a screening\n\t\t\t test,  the cancer may be treated. Finding these cancers is called\noverdiagnosis\n.  It is  not known if treatment of these cancers  would help you live longer than if no treatment  were given.\nTreatments for\nprostate cancer\n, such as\nradical prostatectomy\nand\nradiation therapy\n, may have long-term\nside effects\nin many men. The most common side effects are\nerectile dysfunction\nand\nurinary incontinence\n.\nSome studies of patients with newly\ndiagnosed\nprostate cancer showed these patients had a higher risk of death from\ncardiovascular\n(heart and\nblood vessel\n) disease or\nsuicide\n. The risk was greatest in the first weeks or months after\ndiagnosis\n.\nFollow-up tests, such as a biopsy, may be done to diagnose cancer.\nIf a\nPSA test\nis higher than normal, a\nbiopsy\nof the prostate may be done.\nComplications\nfrom a biopsy of the prostate may include\nfever\n, pain,\nblood\nin the\nurine\nor\nsemen\n, and\nurinary tract\ninfection\n. Even if a biopsy shows that a patient does not have prostate cancer, he may worry more about developing prostate cancer in the future.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\u2212guided biopsy\nis being studied in the\ndiagnosis\nof prostate cancer, either in place of, or in addition to,\nstandard\nprostate\nneedle biopsy\n.\nFalse-negative test results can occur.\nScreening test results may appear to be normal even though prostate cancer is\n\t\t\t present. A man who receives a\nfalse-negative test result\n(one that\n\t\t\t shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care  even if he has symptoms.\nFalse-positive test results can occur.\nScreening test results may appear to be\nabnormal\neven though no\n\t\t\t cancer is present. A\nfalse-positive test result\n(one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause\nanxiety\nand is usually followed by more  tests, (such as\n\t\t\t  biopsy) which also have risks.\nYour doctor can advise you about your risk for prostate cancer and your need for screening tests.\nAbout This PDQ Summary\nAbout PDQ\nPhysician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in\nSpanish\n.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government\u2019s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about prostate cancer screening.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the\nPDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board\n.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at\nNCI's website\n.

This disease usually remains in the\novary\n. When disease is found in one\n\t\t  ovary, the other ovary  should also be checked carefully for\nsigns\nof\n\t\t  disease.\nThe ovaries are a pair of\norgans\nin the female\nreproductive system\n. They are\n\t\t  in the\npelvis\n, one on each\n\t\t  side of the\nuterus\n(the hollow,\n\t\t  pear-shaped organ where a\nfetus\ngrows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries\n\t\t  make eggs and female\nhormones\n.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium.\nSigns and symptoms of ovarian low malignant potential tumor include pain or swelling in the abdomen.\nOvarian low malignant potential tumor may not cause early signs or\nsymptoms\n. If you do have signs or symptoms, they may include the following:\nPain or swelling in the\nabdomen\n.\nPain in the pelvis.\nGastrointestinal\nproblems, such as gas,\nbloating\n, or\nconstipation\n.\nThese signs and symptoms may be caused by other\nconditions\n. If they get worse or do not go away on their own, check with your doctor.\nTests that examine the ovaries are used to diagnose and stage ovarian low malignant potential tumor.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient\u2019s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nPelvic exam\n: An exam of the\nvagina\n,\ncervix\n, uterus,\nfallopian tubes\n, ovaries, and\nrectum\n.    A\nspeculum\nis inserted into the vagina and the doctor or\nnurse\nlooks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A\nPap test\nof the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two\nlubricated\n, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.\nEnlarge\nPelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.\nUltrasound\nexam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal\ntissues\nor organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.\nEnlarge\nAbdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound transducer connected to a computer is passed over the surface of the abdomen. The ultrasound transducer bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nOther patients may have a\ntransvaginal ultrasound\n.\nEnlarge\nTransvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nCA 125\nassay\n: A test that measures the level of CA 125 in the\nblood\n. CA 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream. An increased CA 125 level is sometimes a sign of cancer or other condition.\nChest x-ray\n: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nBiopsy\n: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. The tissue is usually removed during\nsurgery\nto remove the tumor.\nCertain factors affect prognosis\n\t\t  (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe\nstage\nof the\n\t\t  disease (whether it affects part of the\n\t\t  ovary, involves the whole ovary, or has spread to other places in the body).\nWhat type of cells make up the\ntumor\n.\nThe size of the tumor.\nThe patient\u2019s general health.\nPatients with ovarian low malignant potential tumors have a good prognosis, especially when the tumor is found early.\nStages of Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors\nKey Points\nAfter ovarian low malignant potential tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if abnormal cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for ovarian low malignant potential tumor:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nOvarian low\n\t\tmalignant potential\n\t\ttumors can recur\n\t\t(come back) after  they have been treated.\nAfter ovarian low malignant potential tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if abnormal cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out whether\nabnormal\ncells\nhave spread within the\novary\nor to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know the\n\t\t  stage  in order to\n\t\t  plan treatment. Certain tests or procedures are used for staging. Staging\nlaparotomy\n(a\nsurgical\nincision\nmade in the wall of the\nabdomen\nto remove\novarian\ntissue\n)\n\t\t  may be used. Most patients are\ndiagnosed\nwith stage\n\t\t  I disease.\nThe following stages are used for ovarian low malignant potential tumor:\nStage I\nIn stage I, the\ntumor\nis found in one or both\novaries\nor\nfallopian tubes\n. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IC.\nStage IA: The tumor is found inside a single ovary or fallopian tube.\nStage IB: The tumor is found inside both ovaries or fallopian tubes.\nStage IC: The tumor is found inside one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and one of the following is true:\ntumor\ncells\nare found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes; or\nthe\ncapsule\n(outer covering) of the ovary ruptured (broke open) before or during\nsurgery\n; or\ntumor cells are found in the\nfluid\nof the\nperitoneal cavity\n(the body\ncavity\nthat contains most of the\norgans\nin the\nabdomen\n) or in\nwashings\nof the\nperitoneum\n(\ntissue\nlining the peritoneal cavity).\nStage II\nIn stage II, the\ntumor\nis found in one or both\novaries\nor\nfallopian tubes\nand has spread into other areas of the\npelvis\n, or\nprimary peritoneal cancer\nis found within the pelvis. Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB.\nStage IIA: The tumor has spread from where it first formed to the\nuterus\nand/or the fallopian tubes and/or the ovaries.\nStage IIB: The tumor has spread from the ovary or fallopian tube to\norgans\nin  the\nperitoneal cavity\n(the space that contains the\nabdominal\norgans).\nStage III\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).\nIn stage III, the\ntumor\nis found in one or both\novaries\nor\nfallopian tubes\n, or is\nprimary peritoneal cancer\n, and has spread outside the\npelvis\nto other parts of the\nabdomen\nand/or to nearby\nlymph nodes\n.\n\t\t\t  Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC.\nIn stage IIIA, one of the following is true:\nThe tumor has spread to lymph nodes in the area outside or behind the\nperitoneum\nonly;      or\nTumor\ncells\nthat can be seen only with a\nmicroscope\nhave spread to the surface of the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the\nomentum\n(a fold of the peritoneum that surrounds the\nstomach\nand other\norgans\nin the abdomen). The tumor may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nStage IIIB\n: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the omentum, and the tumor  in the peritoneum is 2\ncentimeters\nor smaller. \nThe tumor may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum.\nStage IIIC: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the omentum, and the tumor in the peritoneum is\n\t\t\t\tlarger than 2 centimeters. The tumor may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum or to the surface of the\nliver\nor\nspleen\n.\nStage IV\nIn stage IV,\ntumor\ncells\nhave spread beyond the\nabdomen\nto other parts of the body. Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB.\nStage IVA: Tumor cells are found in  extra\nfluid\nthat builds up  around the\nlungs\n.\nStage IVB: The tumor  has spread to\norgans\nand\ntissues\noutside the abdomen, including\nlymph nodes\nin the\ngroin\n.\nOvarian low\n\t\tmalignant potential\n\t\ttumors can recur\n\t\t(come back) after  they have been treated.\nThe\ntumors\nmay come back in the other\novary\nor in other parts of the\n\t\tbody.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian low\n\t\t  malignant potential tumor.\nTwo types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nChemotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nTreatment for ovarian low malignant potential tumors may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian low\n\t\t  malignant potential tumor.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\n\t\t  ovarian low\n\t\t  malignant potential\n\t\t  tumor. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some\n\t\t  are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.\n\t\t   A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help\n\t\t  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients\n\t\t  with\ncancer\n,\ntumors\n, and related\nconditions\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nTwo types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nThe type of\nsurgery\n(removing the\ntumor\nin an operation) depends on\n\t\t\t the size and spread of the tumor and the woman\u2019s plans for having children. Surgery\n\t\t\t may include the following:\nUnilateral\n\t\t\t\tsalpingo-oophorectomy\n: Surgery to remove one\novary\nand one\nfallopian tube\n.\nBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.\nTotal hysterectomy\nand\n\t\t\t\tbilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove the\nuterus\n,\ncervix\n, and both ovaries and fallopian tubes.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the\nvagina\n, the operation is called a\nvaginal\nhysterectomy\n.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large\nincision\n(cut) in the\nabdomen\n, the operation is called a total\nabdominal\nhysterectomy.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a\nlaparoscope\n, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.\nEnlarge\nHysterectomy. The uterus is surgically removed with or without other organs or tissues. In a total hysterectomy, the uterus and cervix are removed. In a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy, (a) the uterus plus one (unilateral) ovary and fallopian tube are removed; or (b) the uterus plus both (bilateral) ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed. In a radical hysterectomy, the uterus, cervix, both ovaries, both fallopian tubes, and nearby tissue are removed. These procedures are done using a low transverse incision or a vertical incision.\nPartial oophorectomy\n: Surgery to remove part of one ovary or part of both ovaries.\nOmentectomy\n:\n\t\t\t\tSurgery to remove the\nomentum\n(a piece of the\ntissue\nlining the abdominal wall).\nAfter the doctor removes all disease that can be seen at the\n\t\t\t time of the surgery, the patient may be given\nchemotherapy\nafter surgery to kill any tumor\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given\n\t\t\t after the surgery, to lower the risk that the tumor will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n, an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and\nstage\nof the cancer being treated.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nInformation about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for ovarian low malignant potential tumors may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the medical research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.\nMany of today's standard treatments for disease are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way diseases will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose disease has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop a disease from\nrecurring\n(coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nSome of the tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nthe disease may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. This is sometimes called re-staging.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the disease has\nrecurred\n(come back). These tests are sometimes called\nfollow-up\ntests or check-ups.\nTreatment of Early Stage Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors (Stage I and II)\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nSurgery\nis the\nstandard treatment\nfor early\nstage\novarian low\n\t\t  malignant potential\n\t\t  tumor\n.

When\ncells\nthat are meant to form\nsperm\nin the\ntesticles\nor eggs in the\novaries\ntravel to other parts of the body, they may grow into\nextragonadal germ cell tumors\n.  These\ntumors\nmay begin to grow anywhere in the body but usually begin in organs such as  the\npineal gland\nin the brain,  in the\nmediastinum\n(area between the\nlungs\n), or in  the retroperitoneum (the back wall of the\nabdomen\n).\nEnlarge\nExtragonadal germ cell tumors form in parts of the body other than the gonads (testicles or ovaries).  This includes the pineal gland in the brain, the mediastinum (area between the lungs), and retroperitoneum (the back wall of the abdomen).\nExtragonadal germ cell tumors can be\nbenign\n(noncancer) or\nmalignant\n(\ncancer\n). Benign extragonadal germ cell tumors are called benign\nteratomas\n. These  are more common than malignant extragonadal germ cell tumors and often are very large.\nMalignant extragonadal germ cell tumors are divided into two types,\nnonseminoma\nand\nseminoma\n. Nonseminomas tend to  grow and spread more quickly than seminomas. They  usually are large and cause\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\n. \nIf untreated, malignant extragonadal germ cell tumors may spread to the lungs,\nlymph nodes\n, bones,\nliver\n, or other parts of the body.\nFor information about\ngerm cell tumors\nin the ovaries and testicles, see the following\nPDQ\nsummaries:\nOvarian Germ Cell Tumors Treatment\nTesticular Cancer Treatment\nAge and gender can affect the risk of extragonadal germ cell tumors.\nAnything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn\u2019t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for malignant extragonadal germ cell tumors include the following:\nBeing male.\nBeing age 20 or older.\nHaving\nKlinefelter syndrome\n.\nSigns and symptoms of extragonadal germ cell tumors include breathing problems and chest pain.\nMalignant extragonadal germ cell tumors may cause signs and symptoms as they  grow into nearby areas.

The testicles may be  checked for lumps, swelling, or pain. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nChest x-ray\n: An\nx-ray\nof the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nSerum tumor marker test\n: A procedure in which a sample of\nblood\nis examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs,\ntissues\n, or tumor cells in the body.   Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called\ntumor markers\n. The following three tumor markers are used to detect extragonadal germ cell tumor:\nAlpha-fetoprotein\n(AFP).\nBeta-human chorionic gonadotropin\n(beta-hCG).\nLactate dehydrogenase\n(LDH).\nBlood levels of the tumor markers help determine if the tumor is a seminoma or nonseminoma.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nSometimes a CT scan and a\nPET scan\nare done at the same time. A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\n\nWhen a PET scan and CT scan are done at the same time, it is called a PET-CT.\nBiopsy\n: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed   under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer.

For\nextragonadal germ cell tumors\n,\nprognostic\ngroups are used instead of stages. The\ntumors\nare grouped according to how well the cancer is expected to\nrespond\nto treatment. It is important to know the prognostic group in order to plan treatment.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor. For example, if  an extragonadal germ cell tumor spreads to the\nlung\n, the tumor cells in the lung are actually cancerous germ cells. The disease is metastatic extragonadal germ cell tumor, not lung cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nThe following prognostic groups are used for extragonadal germ cell tumors:\nGood prognosis\nA\nnonseminoma\nextragonadal germ cell tumor\nis in the good\nprognosis\ngroup if:\nthe\ntumor\nis  in the back of the\nabdomen\n; and\nthe tumor has not spread to\norgans\nother than the\nlungs\n; and\nthe levels of\ntumor markers\nAFP\nand\nbeta-hCG\nare normal and\nLDH\nis slightly above normal.\nA\nseminoma\nextragonadal germ cell tumor\nis in the good\nprognosis\ngroup if:\nthe\ntumor\nhas not spread to\norgans\nother than the\nlungs\n; and\nthe level of\nAFP\nis normal;\nbeta-hCG\nand\nLDH\nmay be at any level.\nIntermediate prognosis\nA\nnonseminoma\nextragonadal germ cell tumor\nis  in the intermediate\nprognosis\ngroup if:\nthe\ntumor\nis in the back of the\nabdomen\n; and\nthe tumor has not spread to\norgans\nother than the\nlungs\n; and\nthe level of any one of the\ntumor markers\n(\nAFP\n,\nbeta-hCG\n, or\nLDH\n) is more than slightly above normal.\nA\nseminoma\nextragonadal germ cell tumor\nis in the  intermediate\nprognosis\ngroup if:\nthe\ntumor\nhas spread to\norgans\nother than the\nlungs\n; and\nthe level of\nAFP\nis normal;\nbeta-hCG\nand\nLDH\nmay be at any level.\nPoor prognosis\nA\nnonseminoma\nextragonadal germ cell tumor\nis in the poor\nprognosis\ngroup if:\nthe\ntumor\nis in the chest; or\nthe tumor has spread to\norgans\nother than the\nlungs\n; or\nthe level of any one of the\ntumor markers\n(\nAFP\n,\nbeta-hCG\n, or\nLDH\n) is high.\nSeminoma\nextragonadal germ cell tumor\ndoes not have a poor\nprognosis\ngroup.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors.\nThree types of standard treatment are used:\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nSurgery\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nTreatment for extragonadal germ cell tumors may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for  patients with\nextragonadal germ cell tumors\n.

When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nThree types of standard treatment are used:\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer\ncells\nor keep them from growing.  There are two types of radiation therapy:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer.\nThe way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and\nstage\nof the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat\nseminoma\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).  When chemotherapy is placed directly in the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n, an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the\nabdomen\n, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.\nSurgery\nPatients who have\nbenign tumors\nor\ntumor\nremaining after chemotherapy or radiation therapy may need to have\nsurgery\n.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about  clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nHigh\ndoses\nof chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell transplant\nis a treatment to replace the\nblood\n-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient or a\ndonor\nand are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nTreatment for extragonadal germ cell tumors may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice.

Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nAfter initial treatment for extragonadal germ cell tumors, blood levels of\nAFP\nand other\ntumor markers\ncontinue to be  checked to find out how well the treatment is working.\nTreatment of Benign Teratoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nbenign\nteratomas\nis\nsurgery\n.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "right_answer": "Key Points\n                    - After retinoblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the eye or to other parts of the body.     - The International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS) may be used for staging retinoblastoma.          - Stage 0     - Stage I     - Stage II     - Stage III     - Stage IV        - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - Treatment for retinoblastoma depends on whether it is intraocular (within the eye) or extraocular (outside the eye).          - Intraocular retinoblastoma      - Extraocular retinoblastoma (metastatic)\n                \n                \n                    After retinoblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the eye or to other parts of the body.\n                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the eye or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines whether retinoblastoma is only in the eye (intraocular) or has spread outside the eye (extraocular). It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The results of the tests used to diagnose cancer are often also used to stage the disease. (See the General Information section.)   The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner that also takes a picture of the body. Areas of bone with cancer show up brighter in the picture because they take up more radioactive material than normal bone cells do.    -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is done if the doctor thinks the cancer has spread outside of the eye.    -   Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\n                \n                \n                    The International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS) may be used for staging retinoblastoma.\n                    There are several staging systems for retinoblastoma. The IRSS stages are based on how much cancer remains after surgery to remove the tumor and whether the cancer has spread.      Stage 0     The tumor is in the eye only. The eye has not been removed and the tumor was treated without surgery.        Stage I    The tumor is in the eye only. The eye has been removed and no cancer cells remain.        Stage II     The tumor is in the eye only. The eye has been removed and there are cancer cells left that can be seen only with a microscope.        Stage III     Stage III is divided into stages IIIa and IIIb:            - In stage IIIa, cancer has spread from the eye to tissues around the eye socket.     - In stage IIIb, cancer has spread from the eye to lymph nodes near the ear or in the neck.               Stage IV     Stage IV is divided into stages IVa and IVb:            - In stage IVa, cancer has spread to the blood but not to the brain or spinal cord. One or more tumors may have spread to other parts of the body such as the bone or liver.     - In stage IVb, cancer has spread to the brain or spinal cord. It also may have spread to other parts of the body.\n                \n                \n                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\n                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.\n                \n                \n                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\n                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if retinoblastoma spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually retinoblastoma cells. The disease is metastatic retinoblastoma, not bone cancer.\n                \n                \n                    Treatment for retinoblastoma depends on whether it is intraocular (within the eye) or extraocular (outside the eye).\n                    Intraocular retinoblastoma     In intraocular retinoblastoma, cancer is found in one or both eyes and may be in the retina only or may also be in other parts of the eye such as the choroid, ciliary body, or part of the optic nerve. Cancer has not spread to tissues around the outside of the eye or to other parts of the body.        Extraocular retinoblastoma (metastatic)    In extraocular retinoblastoma, cancer has spread beyond the eye. It may be found in tissues around the eye (orbital retinoblastoma) or it may have spread to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or to other parts of the body such as the liver, bones, bone marrow, or lymph nodes.",

It receives light and converts the light into signals that travel down the\noptic nerve\nto the\nbrain\n. The brain decodes the signals so that you can\nsee\nthe image.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the eye, showing the outside and inside of the eye including the sclera, cornea, iris, ciliary body, choroid, retina, vitreous humor, and optic nerve. The vitreous humor is a gel that fills the center of the eye.\nRetinoblastoma\nmay be in one eye  (\nunilateral\n) or in both eyes (\nbilateral\n). Cavitary retinoblastoma is a rare type of retinoblastoma in which\ncavities\n(hollow spaces) form within the\ntumor\n.\nAlthough\nretinoblastoma\nmay occur at any age, it occurs most often in children younger than 2 years.\nChildren with a family history of retinoblastoma should have eye exams to check for retinoblastoma.\nA child with a\nfamily history\nof retinoblastoma should have regular eye exams beginning early in life to check for retinoblastoma, unless it is known that the child does not have the\nRB1\ngene\nchange. Early\ndiagnosis\nof retinoblastoma may mean the child will need less intense treatment.\nTalk with your child\u2019s doctor about the type of eye exam, how often eye exams are done, and at what age eye exams to check for retinoblastoma can stop.\nRetinoblastoma occurs in heritable and nonheritable forms.\nA child is thought to have the\nheritable\n(inherited) form of retinoblastoma when there is a certain\nmutation\n(change) in the\nRB1\ngene. The mutation in the\nRB1\ngene may be passed from the parent to the child, or it may occur in the egg or\nsperm\nbefore\nconception\nor soon after conception.\nOther factors that suggest the child may have the heritable form of retinoblastoma include the following:\nThere is a family history of retinoblastoma.\nThere is more than one tumor in the eye.\nThere is a tumor in both eyes.\nAfter heritable retinoblastoma has been diagnosed and treated, new tumors may continue to form for a few years. Regular eye exams to check for new tumors are usually done every 2 to 4 months for at least 28 months.\nMost cases of retinoblastoma are the\nnonheritable\nform. Nonheritable retinoblastoma is not passed down from parents. This type of retinoblastoma is caused by mutations in the\nRB1\ngene that occur by chance after a child is born. Nonheritable retinoblastoma usually occurs in one eye.\nA child who has heritable retinoblastoma has an increased risk of trilateral retinoblastoma and other cancers.\nA child with heritable retinoblastoma has an increased risk of a\npineal tumor\nin the brain. When retinoblastoma and a\nbrain tumor\noccur at the same time, it is called trilateral retinoblastoma. The brain tumor is usually diagnosed between 20 and 36 months of age. Regular\nscreening\nusing\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging) may be done for a child  thought to have heritable retinoblastoma or for a child with retinoblastoma in one eye and a family history of the disease.\nCT\n(computerized tomography)   scans are usually not used for routine screening in order to avoid exposing the child  to\nionizing radiation\n.\nHeritable retinoblastoma also increases the child's risk of other types of cancer such as\nlung cancer\n,\nbladder cancer\n, or\nmelanoma\nin later years. Regular\nfollow-up\nexams are  important.\nGenetic testing can determine whether a child has the heritable or nonheritable form of retinoblastoma.\nIt is not always clear from the\nfamily medical history\nwhether a\ncondition\nis inherited. Certain families may benefit from\ngenetic counseling\nand\ngenetic testing\n.\nGenetic counselors\nand other specially trained health professionals can help parents understand the following:\nTheir family medical history.\nTheir options for\nRB1\ngene testing\n.\nThe risk of retinoblastoma for the child and the child's brothers or sisters.\nThe risks and benefits of learning genetic information.\nGenetic counselors can also help people cope with their genetic testing results, including how to discuss the results with family members.\nOnce it is known  that the child has heritable retinoblastoma, other family members can be screened for the\nRB1\nmutation. For one specific mutation, the risk of retinoblastoma in a\nsibling\nmay depend partly on whether the mutation is inherited from the mother or from the father.\nSigns and symptoms of retinoblastoma  include \"white pupil\" and eyes that appear to be looking in different directions (crossed eyes).\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by retinoblastoma or by other\nconditions\n. Check with a doctor if your child has any of the  following:\nPupil\nof the eye that appears white instead of red when  light shines into it. This may be seen in flash photographs of the child.\nEnlarge\nClose-up photograph showing the eyes of a child with retinoblastoma. The pupil of the eye on the left side of the photo appears white compared to the pupil of the eye on the right side of the photo. A \"white pupil\" may be a sign of retinoblastoma.\nEyes  that appear to be looking in different directions (crossed eyes).\nPain or redness in the eye.\nInfection\naround the eye.\nEyeball that is larger than normal.\nColored part of the eye and pupil look cloudy.\nTests that examine the retina are used to diagnose retinoblastoma.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient\u2019s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. The doctor will ask if there is a family history of retinoblastoma.\nEye exam with\ndilated\npupil\n: An exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (opened wider)   with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the\nlens\nand pupil to the retina. The inside of the eye, including the retina and the optic nerve, is examined with a  light. In young children, this exam may be done under\nanesthesia\n.\nThere are several types of eye exams that are done with the pupil dilated:\nOphthalmoscopy\n: An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light.\nFluorescein\nangiography\n: A procedure to look at\nblood vessels\nand the flow of\nblood\ninside the eye.   An orange fluorescent\ndye\ncalled fluorescein is\ninjected\ninto a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and\nchoroid\nto find any blood vessels that are blocked or leaking.\nElectroretinography\n: An eye test that uses light and small\nelectrodes\nto study the retina (the light-detecting part of the eye). This test measures and records  the faint electrical signals given off  by the cells in  the retina when exposed to different types and amounts of light. It can be used to assess the function of the retina during and after treatment.\nRB1\ngene test\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for a change in the\nRB1\ngene.\nUltrasound\nexam of the eye\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes.   Eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is  placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a picture of the inside of the eye and the distance from the\ncornea\nto the retina is measured. The picture, called a\nsonogram\n, shows  on the screen of the ultrasound\nmonitor\n. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.\nMRI (magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the eye. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nRetinoblastoma can usually be diagnosed without a\nbiopsy\n.\nWhen retinoblastoma is in one eye, it sometimes forms in the other eye. Exams of the unaffected eye are done until it is known that the retinoblastoma is the nonheritable form.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nWhether the cancer is in one or both eyes.\nThe size and number of  tumors.\nWhether the tumor has spread to the area around the eye, to the brain, or to other parts of the body.\nThe age of the child.\nHow likely it is that vision can be saved in one or both eyes.\nWhether a second type of cancer has formed.\nWhether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nStages of Retinoblastoma\nKey Points\nAfter retinoblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out\n\t\t  if cancer cells have spread within the eye or to other parts of the body.\nThe International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS) may be used for staging retinoblastoma.\nStage 0\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nTreatment for retinoblastoma depends on whether it is intraocular (within the eye) or extraocular (outside the eye).\nIntraocular retinoblastoma\nExtraocular retinoblastoma\n(metastatic)\nTreatment for retinoblastoma also depends on whether the cancer has progressed or recurred.\nAfter retinoblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out\n\t\t  if cancer cells have spread within the eye or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread within the eye or\n\t\t  to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the staging\n\t\t  process determines whether\nretinoblastoma\nis only in the eye (\nintraocular\n) or has spread outside the eye (\nextraocular\n). It is important to know\nthe\nstage\nin order to plan treatment. The results of the\ntests and procedures\nused to\ndiagnose\ncancer are often also used to stage the disease.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\nbrain\n.

A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the child's vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive material collects in the bones. As the child lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen.\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy\n: The removal of\nbone marrow\nand a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow under a\nmicroscope\nto look for\nsigns\nof cancer. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is done if the doctor thinks the cancer has spread outside of the eye.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child\u2019s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.\nLumbar puncture\n: A procedure used to collect\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) from the\nspinal column\n. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the\nspine\nand into the CSF around the\nspinal cord\nand removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord and sometimes it is also checked for a\ntumor marker\ncalled\nganglioside\nGD2. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\nThe International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS) may be used for staging retinoblastoma.\nThere are several\nstaging systems\nfor retinoblastoma. The IRSS stages are based on how much cancer remains after\nsurgery\nto remove the\ntumor\nand whether the cancer has spread.\nStage 0\nThe\ntumor\nis in the eye only. The eye has not been removed and the tumor was treated without\nsurgery\n.\nStage I\nThe\ntumor\nis in the eye only. The eye has been removed and no cancer\ncells\nremain.\nStage II\nThe\ntumor\nis in the eye only. The eye has been removed and cancer cells remain that can be seen only with a microscope.\nStage III\nStage\nIII is divided into stage IIIa and stage IIIb:\nIn stage IIIa, cancer has spread from the eye to\ntissues\naround the eye socket.\nIn stage IIIb, cancer has spread from the eye to\nlymph nodes\nnear the ear or in the neck.\nStage IV\nStage\nIV is divided into stage IVa and stage IVb:\nIn stage IVa, cancer has spread to one or more parts of the body, such as the bone or\nliver\n.\nIn stage IVb, cancer has spread to the brain or spinal cord. It also may have spread to other parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  retinoblastoma spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually retinoblastoma cells. The disease is metastatic retinoblastoma, not bone cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nTreatment for retinoblastoma depends on whether it is intraocular (within the eye) or extraocular (outside the eye).\nIntraocular retinoblastoma\nIn\nintraocular\nretinoblastoma\n,\ncancer\nis found in  one or both eyes and may be in the\nretina\nonly or may also be in other parts of the eye such as   the\nchoroid\n,\nciliary body\n,  or part of the\noptic nerve\n. Cancer has not spread to\ntissues\naround the outside of the eye or to other parts of the body.\nExtraocular retinoblastoma\n(metastatic)\nIn\nextraocular\nretinoblastoma\n,\ncancer\nhas spread beyond the eye. It may be found in\ntissues\naround the eye (orbital retinoblastoma), or it may have spread to the\ncentral nervous system\n(brain and spinal cord) or to other parts of the body such as the\nliver\n, bone,\nbone marrow\n, or\nlymph nodes\n.\nTreatment for retinoblastoma also depends on whether the cancer has progressed or recurred.\nProgressive\nretinoblastoma\nis cancer that continues to grow, spread or get worse. Progressive disease may be a sign that the cancer has become\nrefractory\nto treatment.\nRecurrent\nretinoblastoma is cancer that has\nrecurred\n(come back)  after it has been treated. The cancer may recur in the eye,  in\ntissues\naround the eye, or  in other places in the body, such as the liver, bone, bone marrow, or lymph nodes.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with retinoblastoma.\nChildren with retinoblastoma should have their treatment\n\t\t  planned by a team of      health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nSix types of standard treatment are used:\nCryotherapy\nThermotherapy\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue\nSurgery (enucleation)\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTargeted therapy\nTreatment for retinoblastoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with retinoblastoma.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\nretinoblastoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some\n\t\t  are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.\n\t\t  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help\n\t\t  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients\n\t\t  with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.\nBecause cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nChildren with retinoblastoma should have their treatment\n\t\t  planned by a team of      health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nThe goals of treatment are to save the child's life, to save vision and the eye, and to prevent serious\nside effects\n. Treatment will be overseen by a\npediatric oncologist\n, a doctor who specializes\n\t\t  in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist  works with\n\t\t  other\nhealth care providers\nwho are experts in treating children\n\t\t  with\neye cancer\nand who specialize\n\t\t  in certain areas of\nmedicine\n. These may include a\npediatric\nophthalmologist\n(children's eye doctor) who has a lot of experience in treating retinoblastoma and the following\nspecialists\n:\nPediatric surgeon\n.\nRadiation\n\t\t\t oncologist\n.\nPediatrician\n.\nPediatric nurse specialist\n.\nRehabilitation specialist\n.\nSocial worker\n.\nGeneticist\nor\ngenetic counselor\n.\nSix types of standard treatment are used:\nCryotherapy\nCryotherapy\nis the use of extreme cold to destroy\nabnormal\ntissue\n.  A small metal probe is cooled below freezing and placed on the surface of the eye near the\ntumor\n, which freezes and kills cancer\ncells\n. Cryotherapy is usually used to treat small retinoblastoma tumors that are located toward the front of the eye. This type of treatment is also called cryosurgery.\nThermotherapy\nThermotherapy\nis the use of  heat to destroy cancer\ncells\n.  Thermotherapy may be given using a\nlaser\nbeam aimed through the\ndilated\npupil\nor  onto the outside of the eyeball. Thermotherapy may be used alone for small\ntumors\nor combined with\nchemotherapy\nfor larger tumors. This treatment is a type of\nlaser therapy\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the\nstage\nof the cancer and where the cancer is in the body.\nThere are different types of chemotherapy:\nSystemic chemotherapy\n: When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body. Systemic chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumor (\nchemoreduction\n) and avoid surgery to remove the eye. After chemoreduction, other treatments may include\nradiation therapy\n, cryotherapy, laser therapy, or\nregional chemotherapy\n. However, extraorbital disease requires\nintensive chemotherapy\nand may include consolidation with\nhigh-dose chemotherapy\nand\nautologous stem cell transplantation\nwith or without radiation therapy.\nSystemic chemotherapy may also be given to kill any cancer cells that are left after the initial treatment or to kill cancer cells that are outside the eye. Treatment given after the initial treatment, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRegional chemotherapy: When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(\nintrathecal chemotherapy\n),  an\norgan\n(such as the eye), or a body\ncavity\n, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas. Several types of regional chemotherapy are used to treat retinoblastoma.\nOphthalmic artery infusion\nchemotherapy: Ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy carries anticancer drugs directly to the eye. A\ncatheter\nis put into an\nartery\nthat leads to the eye and the anticancer drug is given through the catheter.  After the drug is given, a small balloon may be inserted into the artery to block it and keep most of the anticancer drug trapped near the tumor. This type of chemotherapy may be given as the initial treatment when the tumor is in the eye only or when the tumor has not responded to other types of treatment. Ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy is given at special retinoblastoma treatment centers.\nIntravitreal chemotherapy\n: Intravitreal chemotherapy is the\ninjection\nof anticancer drugs directly into the\nvitreous humor\n(jelly-like substance) inside of the eye. It is used to treat cancer that has spread to the vitreous humor and has not responded to treatment or has come back after treatment.\nIntrathecal chemotherapy\n: Intrathecal chemotherapy is the injection of anticancer drugs directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF). It is used to treat cancer that has spread to the\nbrain\n.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Retinoblastoma\nfor more information.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.  There are two types of radiation therapy:\nExternal-beam radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nCertain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:\nIntensity-modulated radiation therapy\n(IMRT):  IMRT is a type of\n3-dimensional\n(3-D) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of  the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.\nProton beam radiation therapy\n: Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of\nprotons\n(tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells.  This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy tissue near a tumor.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer.  Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. This type of internal radiation therapy may include the following:\nPlaque radiotherapy\n: Radioactive seeds are attached to one side of a disk, called a plaque, and placed directly on the outside wall of the \n eye near the tumor.  The \nside of the plaque with the seeds on it faces the eyeball, aiming  radiation at \n the tumor. The plaque helps  protect other nearby tissue from the radiation.\nEnlarge\nPlaque radiotherapy of the eye.  A type of radiation therapy used to treat eye tumors. Radioactive seeds are placed on one side of a thin piece of metal (usually gold) called a plaque.  The plaque is sewn onto the outside wall of the eye.  The seeds give off radiation which kills the cancer. The plaque is removed at the end of treatment, which usually lasts for several days.\nWhether internal or external radiation therapy is given depends on the stage of the cancer being treated, where it is found in the body, and how the cancer responded to other treatments.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue\nHigh\ndoses\nof chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including\nblood\n-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell rescue\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. Extraorbital disease requires intensive chemotherapy and may include consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation with or without radiation therapy.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Retinoblastoma\nfor more information.\nSurgery (enucleation)\nEnucleation\nis\nsurgery\nto remove  the eye  and part of the\noptic nerve\n. A sample of the eye tissue that is removed will be checked under a\nmicroscope\nto see if there are any\nsigns\nthat the cancer is likely to spread to other parts of the body. This should be done by an experienced\npathologist\n, who is familiar with retinoblastoma and other diseases of the eye. Enucleation is done if there is little or no chance that vision can be saved and when the\ntumor\nis large, did not\nrespond\nto treatment, or comes back after treatment. The patient will be fitted for an artificial eye.\nClose follow-up is needed for 2 years or more  to check for signs of\nrecurrence\nin the area around the affected eye and to check the other eye.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.\nOncolytic virus therapy\n: This treatment uses a\nvirus\nthat infects and breaks down cancer cells but not normal cells. An oncolytic\nadenovirus\ntargeting the\nRB1\ngene\nis injected into the tumor and may have anticancer effects in retinoblastoma. Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of retinoblastoma that has\nprogressed\nor\nred\n.\nTreatment for retinoblastoma may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSide effects\nfrom cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called\nlate effects\n. Late effects of treatment for retinoblastoma may include the following:\nPhysical problems such as seeing or hearing problems.\nIf the eye is removed, there may be changes in the shape and size of the bone around the eye until an artificial eye is fitted. This is most likely to occur in children aged younger than 3 years.\nChanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.\nSecond cancers\n(new types of cancer), such as\nlung\nand\nbladder cancers\n,\nosteosarcoma\n,\nsoft tissue sarcoma\n, or\nmelanoma\n.\nThe following\nrisk factors\nmay increase the risk of having a second cancer:\nHaving the\nheritable\nform of retinoblastoma.\nPast treatment with radiation therapy, especially before age 1 year.\nHaving already had a previous second cancer.\nIt is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. Regular\nfollow-up\nby health professionals who are experts in\ndiagnosing\nand treating late effects is important. See the\nPDQ\nsummary on\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\nfor more information.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nIn retinoblastoma, new tumors may form for a few years after treatment. Regular eye exams are done to check for tumors in both eyes. Children with the heritable form of retinoblastoma will also have imaging tests to check whether cancer has spread to the brain.\nTreatment of Unilateral, Bilateral, and Cavitary Retinoblastoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nIf it is likely that the eye can be saved, treatment may include the following:\nSystemic chemotherapy\nor\nophthalmic artery infusion\nchemotherapy\n, with or without\nintravitreal chemotherapy\n, to shrink the\ntumor\n. This may be followed by one or more of the following:\nCryotherapy\n.\nThermotherapy\n.\nPlaque radiotherapy\n.\nExternal-beam radiation therapy\nfor\nbilateral\nintraocular\nretinoblastoma\nthat does not\nrespond\nto other treatments.\nIf the tumor is large and it is not likely that the eye can be saved, treatment may include the following:\nSurgery\n(\nenucleation\n). After surgery, systemic chemotherapy may be given to lower the risk that the\ncancer\nwill spread to other parts of the body.\nWhen retinoblastoma is in both eyes, the treatment for each eye may be different, depending on the size of the tumor and whether it is likely that the eye can be saved. The\ndose\nof systemic chemotherapy  is usually based on the eye that has more cancer.\nPatients with cavitary retinoblastoma respond well to treatment and have favorable long-term outcomes, similar to patients with noncavitary retinoblastoma.\nTreatment of Extraocular Retinoblastoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nextraocular\nretinoblastoma\n(cancer has spread to the area around the eye) may include the following:\nSystemic chemotherapy\nand\nexternal-beam radiation therapy\n.\nEnucleation\n.\nSystemic chemotherapy followed by\nsurgery\n(enucleation). External-beam radiation therapy and more\nchemotherapy\nmay be given after surgery.\nTreatment for extraocular retinoblastoma (cancer has spread to the\nbrain\n) may include the following:\nSystemic or\nintrathecal chemotherapy\nand external-beam radiation therapy to the brain and\nspinal cord\n.\nChemotherapy followed by\nhigh-dose chemotherapy\nwith\nstem cell rescue\nwith or without\nradiation therapy\n.\nIt is not clear whether treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue helps patients with extraocular retinoblastoma live longer.\nFor trilateral retinoblastoma (retinoblastoma and a\nbrain tumor\nthat occur at the same time), treatment may include the following:\nSystemic chemotherapy followed by surgery and high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue.\nSystemic chemotherapy followed by surgery and external-beam radiation therapy.\nFor retinoblastoma that has spread to other parts of the body, but not the brain, treatment may include the following:\nSystemic chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue and external-beam radiation therapy.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "hallucinated_answer": "The stages of retinoblastoma are based on the International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS). The staging is determined after surgery to remove the tumor and whether the cancer has spread. \n1. Stage 0: Tumor is in the eye only, and the eye has not been removed, but the tumor was treated without surgery.\n2. Stage I: Tumor is in the eye only, and the eye has been removed with no remaining cancer cells.\n3. Stage II: Tumor is in the eye only, and the eye has been removed with residual microscopic cancer cells.\n4. Stage III (a & b): Cancer has spread to tissues around the eye socket or lymph nodes near the ear or neck. \n5. Stage IV (a & b): Cancer has spread to other parts of the body such as bones, liver, blood but not brain or spinal cord (stage IVa), or it has also spread to the brain or spinal cord (stage IVb).\n\nTreatment for retinoblastoma depends on whether it is intraocular (within the eye) or extraocular (outside the eye). In intraocular retinoblastoma, cancer is found in one or both eyes but has not spread to tissues outside of the eye or other parts of the body. Extraocular retinoblastoma occurs when cancer has spread beyond the eye, either to surrounding tissues (orbital retinoblastoma) or to other parts of the body such as the liver, bones, bone marrow, or lymph nodes."

        "question": "What are the treatments for Childhood Craniopharyngioma ?",
        "right_answer": "Key Points\n                    - There are different types of treatment for children with craniopharyngioma.    - Children with craniopharyngioma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children.     - Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.    - Some treatments for tumors cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.     - Five types of treatment are used:          - Surgery (resection)     - Surgery and radiation therapy     - Surgery with cyst drainage     - Chemotherapy     - Biologic therapy        - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.\n                \n                \n                    There are different types of treatment for children with craniopharyngioma.\n                    Different types of treatments are available for children with craniopharyngioma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with tumors. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Because tumors in children are rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Choosing the most appropriate treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.\n                \n                \n                    Children with craniopharyngioma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children.\n                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with tumors. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:          -  Pediatrician.    -  Neurosurgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Neurologist.    -  Endocrinologist.    -  Ophthalmologist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Psychologist.    -  Social worker.    -  Nurse specialist.\n                \n                \n                    Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.\n                    Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis and continue for months or years. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment.\n                \n                \n                    Some treatments for tumors cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.\n                    Side effects from tumor treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of tumor treatment may include the following:         - Physical problems such as seizures.    - Behavior problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).        The following serious physical problems may occur if the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, optic nerves, or carotid artery are affected during surgery or radiation therapy:         -  Obesity.    -  Metabolic syndrome, including fatty liver disease not caused by drinking alcohol.    - Vision problems, including blindness.    -  Blood vessel problems or stroke.    - Loss of the ability to make certain hormones.        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. Life-long hormone replacement therapy with several medicines may be needed. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects tumor treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).\n                \n                \n                    Five types of treatment are used:\n                    Surgery (resection)     The way the surgery is done depends on the size of the tumor and where it is in the brain. It also depends on whether the tumor has grown into nearby tissue in a finger-like way and expected late effects after surgery.     The types of surgery that may be used to remove all of the tumor that can be seen with the eye include the following:            -  Transsphenoidal surgery: A type of surgery in which the instruments are inserted into part of the brain by going through an incision (cut) made under the upper lip or at the bottom of the nose between the nostrils and then through the sphenoid bone (a butterfly-shaped bone at the base of the skull).     -  Craniotomy: Surgery to remove the tumor through an opening made in the skull.           Sometimes all of the tumor that can be seen is removed in surgery and no further treatment is needed. At other times, it is hard to remove the tumor because it is growing into or pressing on nearby organs. If there is tumor remaining after the surgery, radiation therapy is usually given to kill any tumor cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.        Surgery and radiation therapy    Partial resection is used to treat some craniopharyngiomas. It is used to diagnose the tumor, remove fluid from a cyst, and relieve pressure on the optic nerves. If the tumor is near the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, it is not removed. This reduces the number of serious side effects after surgery. Partial resection is followed by radiation therapy.      Radiation therapy is a tumor treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill tumor cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the tumor.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the tumor.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor, whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has come back, and where the tumor formed in the brain. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat childhood craniopharyngioma.    Because radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development in young children, ways of giving radiation therapy that have fewer side effects are being used. These include:            -  Stereotactic radiosurgery: For very small craniopharyngiomas at the base of the brain, stereotactic radiosurgery may be used. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy. A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment. A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor. This procedure does not involve surgery. It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery, radiosurgery, and radiation surgery.     -  Intracavitary radiation therapy: Intracavitary radiation therapy is a type of internal radiation therapy that may be used in tumors that are part solid mass and part fluid-filled cyst. Radioactive material is placed inside the tumor. This type of radiation therapy causes less damage to the nearby hypothalamus and optic nerves.     - Intensity-modulated proton therapy: A type of radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells. A computer is used to target the exact shape and location of the tumor with proton therapy. This type of 3-dimensional radiation therapy may cause less damage to healthy tissue in the brain and other parts of the body. Proton radiation is different from x-ray radiation.              Surgery with cyst drainage    Surgery may be done to drain tumors that are mostly fluid-filled cysts. This lowers pressure in the brain and relieves symptoms. A catheter (thin tube) is inserted into the cyst and a small container is placed under the skin. The fluid drains into the container and is later removed. Sometimes, after the cyst is drained, a drug is put through the catheter into the cyst. This causes the inside wall of the cyst to scar and stops the cyst from making fluid or increases the amount of the time it takes for the fluid to build up again. Surgery to remove the tumor may be done after the cyst is drained.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses anticancer drugs to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid or an organ, the drugs mainly affect tumor cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).      Intracavitary chemotherapy is a type of regional chemotherapy that places drugs directly into a cavity, such as a cyst. It is used for craniopharyngioma that has come back after treatment.       Biologic therapy     Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. For craniopharyngioma that has come back after treatment, the biologic therapy drug is placed inside the tumor using a catheter (intracavitary) or in a vein (intravenous).\n                \n                \n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.

They are benign (not cancer) and do not spread to other parts of the brain or to other parts of the body. However, they may grow and press on nearby parts of the brain, including the pituitary gland, optic chiasm, and optic nerve. Craniopharyngiomas usually occur in children and young adults.\nCraniopharyngiomas are usually part solid\nmass\nand part\nfluid\n-filled\ncyst\n. They are\nbenign\n(not\ncancer\n) and do not spread to other parts of the brain or to other parts of the body. However, they may grow and press on nearby parts of the brain or other areas, including the pituitary gland, the\noptic chiasm\n,\noptic nerves\n, and fluid-filled spaces in the brain. Craniopharyngiomas may affect many functions of the brain. They may affect the\nhormone\nmaking process, growth, and vision. Benign\nbrain tumors\nneed treatment.\nThis summary is about the treatment of\nprimary\nbrain tumors (tumors that begin in the\n\t\t  brain). Treatment of\nmetastatic\nbrain tumors, which are tumors formed by cancer\ncells\nthat\n\t\t  begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain, is not covered in\n\t\t  this summary.\nBrain tumors can occur in both children and adults; however,\n\t\t  treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults. For information about treatment for adults, see\nAdult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment\n.\nThere are no known risk factors for childhood craniopharyngioma.\nCraniopharyngiomas are rare in children younger than 2 years of age and are most often\ndiagnosed\nin children aged 5 to 14  years. It is not known what causes these tumors.\nSigns of childhood craniopharyngioma include vision changes and slow growth.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by craniopharyngiomas or by other\nconditions\n. Check with your child\u2019s doctor if your child has any of the following:\nheadaches, including morning headache or headache that goes away after\nvomiting\nvision changes\nnausea\nand vomiting\nloss of balance or  trouble walking\nunusual sleepiness or change in energy level\nchanges in personality or behavior\nincrease in thirst or\nurination\nshort\nstature\nor slow growth\nweight gain\nhearing loss\nTests that examine the brain, vision, and  hormone levels are used to detect (find) childhood craniopharyngiomas.\nIn addition to asking about your child's\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your child's doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nNeurological exam\n: A series of questions and tests to check the brain,\nspinal cord\n,    and nerve function. The exam checks a person\u2019s mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles,\nsenses\n, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.\nVisual field exam\n: An exam to check a person\u2019s field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen). This test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead). Any loss of vision may be a sign of a tumor that has damaged or pressed on the parts of the brain that affect eyesight.\nCT scan\n(CAT\n\t\t\t scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or\ntissues\nshow up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain and spinal cord with\ngadolinium\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the tumor cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a\nblood\nsample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and\ntissues\nin the body. An unusual (higher  or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nBlood  hormone studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain hormones released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. For example, the blood may be checked for unusual levels of\nthyroid-stimulating hormone\n(TSH) or\nadrenocorticotropic hormone\n(ACTH). TSH and ACTH are made by the pituitary gland in the brain.\nChildhood craniopharyngiomas may be  diagnosed and  removed in  the same surgery.\nDoctors may think a\nmass\nis a craniopharyngioma based on where it is in the brain and how it looks on a CT scan or MRI. In order to be sure, a sample of tissue is needed.\nOne of the following types of\nbiopsy\nprocedures may be used to take the sample of tissue:\nOpen biopsy\n: A hollow needle is inserted through a hole in the\nskull\ninto the brain.\nComputer-guided\nneedle biopsy\n: A hollow needle guided by a computer is inserted through a small hole in the skull into the brain.\nTranssphenoidal biopsy: Instruments are inserted through the nose and\nsphenoid\nbone (a butterfly-shaped bone at the base of the skull) and into the brain.\nA\npathologist\nviews the tissue under a\nmicroscope\nto look for tumor cells. If tumor cells are found, as much tumor as safely possible may be removed during the same surgery.\nThe following\nlaboratory test\nmay be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:\nImmunohistochemistry\n:  A laboratory test that uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient\u2019s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nthe size of the tumor\nwhere the tumor is in the brain\nwhether there are tumor cells left after surgery\nthe child's age\nside effects\nthat may occur months or years after treatment\nwhether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has\nrecurred\n(come back)\nStages of Childhood Craniopharyngioma\nKey Points\nThere is no standard staging system for childhood craniopharyngioma.\nSometimes childhood craniopharyngioma comes back  after treatment.\nThere is no standard staging system for childhood craniopharyngioma.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread within the\nbrain\nor to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n.  There is no standard\nstaging system\nfor childhood\ncraniopharyngioma\n.       Craniopharyngioma is described as  newly\ndiagnosed\ndisease or\nrecurrent disease\n.\nThe results of the\ntests and procedures\ndone to diagnose craniopharyngioma are used to help make decisions about treatment.\nSometimes childhood craniopharyngioma comes back  after treatment.\nThe\ntumor\nmay come back in the same area of the brain where it was first found.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for children with craniopharyngioma.\nChildren with craniopharyngioma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers  who are experts  in treating brain tumors in children.\nChildhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.\nThe following types of treatment may be used:\nSurgery (resection)\nRadiation therapy\nCyst drainage\nChemotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical \n         trials.\nTreatment for childhood craniopharyngioma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their             treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for children with craniopharyngioma.\nSome treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ntumors\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.\nBecause tumors in children are rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n. Choosing the most appropriate  treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.\nChildren with craniopharyngioma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers  who are experts  in treating brain tumors in children.\nTreatment will be overseen by a\npediatric oncologist\n, a doctor who specializes in treating children with tumors. The pediatric oncologist works with other\npediatric\nhealth care providers\nwho are experts in treating children with\nbrain tumors\nand who specialize in certain areas of\nmedicine\n. These may include the following\nspecialists\n:\npediatrician\nneurosurgeon\nradiation oncologist\nneurologist\nendocrinologist\nophthalmologist\nrehabilitation specialist\npsychologist\nsocial worker\nnurse\nspecialist\nChildhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.\nSigns\nor\nsymptoms\ncaused by the tumor may begin before\ndiagnosis\nand continue for months or years. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment.\nThe following types of treatment may be used:\nSurgery (resection)\nThe way the\nsurgery\nis done depends on the size of the tumor, where it is in the\nbrain\n, and whether the tumor has grown into nearby\ntissue\nin a finger-like way. It also depends on expected\nlate effects\nafter surgery.\nThe types of surgery that may be used to remove all of the tumor that can be seen with the eye include the following:\nTranssphenoidal surgery\n: A type of surgery in which the instruments are inserted into part of the brain by going through an\nincision\n(cut) made under the upper lip or at the bottom of the nose between the nostrils and then through the\nsphenoid\nbone (a butterfly-shaped bone at the base of the skull) to reach the tumor near the\npituitary gland\nand\nhypothalamus\n.\nEnlarge\nTranssphenoidal surgery. An endoscope and a curette are inserted through the nose and sphenoid sinus to remove the tumor.\nCraniotomy\n: Surgery to remove the tumor through an opening made in the\nskull\n.\nEnlarge\nCraniotomy.  An opening is made in the skull and a piece of the skull is removed to show part of the brain.\nPartial\nresection\nmay be used to diagnose the tumor. It can also be used as a treatment  to remove\nfluid\nfrom tumors that are mostly fluid-filled\ncysts\nand relieve pressure on the\noptic nerves\n. If the tumor is near the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, it is not removed. This reduces the number of serious\nside effects\nafter surgery.\nSometimes all of the tumor that can be seen is removed in surgery, and no further treatment is needed. At other times, it is hard to remove the tumor because it is growing into or pressing on nearby\norgans\n. If there is  tumor remaining after the surgery,\nradiation therapy\nis usually given to kill any tumor\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the\ncancer\nwill come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a tumor treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of radiation to kill tumor cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with the tumor.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the tumor.\nThe way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor, whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has come back, and where the tumor formed in the brain. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat childhood craniopharyngioma.\nBecause radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development in young children, ways of giving radiation therapy that have fewer side effects are being used. These include:\nStereotactic radiosurgery\n: For very small craniopharyngiomas at the base of the brain, stereotactic radiosurgery may be used. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy. A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment.  A machine aims a single large\ndose\nof radiation directly at the tumor. This procedure does not involve surgery.  It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery, radiosurgery, and radiation surgery.\nIntracavitary radiation therapy\n:     Intracavitary radiation therapy is a type of internal radiation therapy that may be used in tumors that are part\nsolid\nmass\nand part fluid-filled cyst. Radioactive material is placed inside the tumor. This type of radiation therapy causes less damage to the nearby hypothalamus and optic nerves.\nIntensity-modulated\nphoton\ntherapy: A type of radiation therapy that uses x-rays or\ngamma rays\nthat come from a special machine called a\nlinear accelerator\n(linac) to kill tumor cells. A computer is used to target the exact shape and location of the tumor. Thin beams of photons of different intensities are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of\n3-dimensional radiation therapy\nmay cause less damage to healthy tissue in the brain and other parts of the body. Photon therapy   is different from\nproton\ntherapy.\nProton-beam radiation therapy\n:   A type of radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells. This treatment can reduce the amount of radiation damage to healthy tissue near a tumor. Proton radiation is different from x-ray radiation.\nCyst drainage\nSurgery may be done to\ndrain\ntumors that are mostly fluid-filled cysts.  This lowers pressure in the brain and relieves symptoms. A catheter (thin tube) is inserted into the cyst,  and a small container is placed under the skin. The fluid drains into the container and is later removed. Sometimes, after the cyst is drained, a\ndrug\nis  put through the catheter into the cyst. This causes the inside wall of the cyst to scar and stops the cyst from making fluid or increases the amount of time it takes for the fluid to build up again. Surgery to remove the tumor or radiation therapy may be done after the cyst is drained.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a treatment that uses anticancer drugs to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.\nIntracavitary\nchemotherapy is a type of\nregional chemotherapy\nthat places drugs directly into a\ncavity\n, such as a cyst. It is used for craniopharyngioma that has come back after treatment.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nuses the patient's\nimmune system\nto fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body\u2019s natural defenses against cancer. For craniopharyngioma, the immunotherapy drug (\ninterferon-alpha\n) is placed in a\nvein\n(\nintravenous\n) or inside the tumor using a catheter (intracavitary).\nIn newly diagnosed children, interferon-alpha may be placed directly into the cyst (intracystic)  to delay the need for surgery or radiation therapy. In children whose tumor has\nrecurred\n(come back), intracavitary interferon-alpha is used to treat the cyst part of the tumor.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical \n         trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. \n         Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for childhood craniopharyngioma may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSide effects from tumor treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects.  Late effects of tumor treatment may include the following:\nphysical problems that affect the following:\nbrain (\nseizures\n)\nbone and muscle growth and development\nbehavior problems\nchanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory\nsecond cancers\n(new types of cancer)\nThe following serious physical problems may occur if  the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, optic nerves, or\ncarotid artery\nare affected during surgery or radiation therapy:\nobesity\nmetabolic syndrome\n, including fatty liver disease not caused by drinking\nalcohol\nvision problems, including blindness\nblood vessel\nproblems or\nstroke\nloss of the ability to make certain\nhormones\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. Life-long hormone replacement therapy with several\nmedicines\nmay be needed. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects tumor treatment can have on your child.  For more information, see\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\n.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the medical research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way diseases will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done.\nGeneral information\nabout clinical trials is also available.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their             treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients who have not improved. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop a disease from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of  treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nSome of the tests that were done to diagnose  the disease or decide how to treat it  may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your\ncondition\nhas changed. These tests are sometimes called\nfollow-up\ntests or check-ups.\nAfter treatment, follow-up testing with\nMRI\nwill be done for several years to check if the tumor has come back.\nTreatment of Childhood Craniopharyngioma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of  newly\ndiagnosed\nchildhood\ncraniopharyngioma\nmay include the following:\nSurgery\n(complete\nresection\n) with or without\nradiation therapy\n.\nPartial resection followed by radiation therapy.\nCyst\ndrainage\nwith or without radiation therapy or surgery.\nIntracavitary\nor intracystic\nimmunotherapy\n(\ninterferon-alpha\n).\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

As the sarcoma grows and presses on nearby\norgans\n,\nnerves\n, muscles, or blood vessels, signs and symptoms may include:\nPain.\nTrouble breathing.\nOther\nconditions\nmay cause the same signs and symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems.\nSoft tissue sarcoma is diagnosed with a biopsy.\nIf your doctor thinks you may have a soft tissue sarcoma, a\nbiopsy\nwill be done. The type of biopsy will be based on the size of the\ntumor\nand where it is in the body. These types of biopsies  may be used:\nCore needle biopsy\n: The removal of tissue using a wide needle. Multiple tissue samples are taken. This procedure may be guided using\nultrasound\n,\nCT scan\n, or\nMRI\n.\nIncisional biopsy\n: The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue. An incisional biopsy may be done   when a core needle biopsy  is not safe to perform or core needle biopsy findings are not clear.\nCareful planning of the biopsy should involve the\nsurgeon\n, a\nradiation oncologist\n, and an interventional\nradiologist\nwho uses medical\nimaging\nto guide\ndiagnosis\n. Samples will be taken from the\nprimary tumor\n,\nlymph nodes\n, and other suspicious areas. A\npathologist\nviews the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells and to \n\nfind out the\ngrade\nof the tumor. The grade of a tumor depends on how\nabnormal\nthe cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cells are dividing.\nHigh-grade\ntumors usually grow and spread more quickly than\nlow-grade\ntumors.\nBecause soft tissue sarcoma can be hard to\ndiagnose\n, the  tissue samples should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing soft tissue sarcoma.\nThe following tests may be done on the tissue that was removed:\nImmunohistochemistry\n: A\nlaboratory test\nthat uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient\u2019s tissue.

The cells from a sample of a patient\u2019s\nblood\n,\nbone marrow\n, or other tissue are stained with a fluorescent dye, placed in a\nfluid\n, and then passed one at a time through a beam of light. The test results are based on how the cells that were stained with the fluorescent dye react to the beam of light.\nMolecular profiling\n: A laboratory method that uses a sample of tissue, blood, or other body fluid to check for certain\ngenes\n,\nproteins\n, or other\nmolecules\nthat may be a sign of a disease or\ncondition\n, such as cancer.  It can also be used to  check for certain changes in a\ngene\nor\nchromosome\nthat may increase a person\u2019s risk of developing cancer or other diseases. It  may be done with other procedures, such as biopsies, to help diagnose some types of cancer. It may also be used to help plan treatment, find out how well treatment is working, make a\nprognosis\n, or predict whether cancer will come back or spread to other parts of the body.\nLight\nand\nelectron microscopy\n: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A laboratory test in which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nFISH\n(fluorescence in situ hybridization)\n: A laboratory test used to look at and count\ngenes\nor chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of\nDNA\nthat contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient\u2019s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.\nCertain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery).\nThe treatment options and\nprognosis\ndepend on the following:\nThe type of soft tissue sarcoma.\nThe size, grade, and\nstage\nof the tumor.\nWhere the tumor is in the body.\nWhether all of the tumor is removed by\nsurgery\n.\nThe patient's age and general health.\nWhether the cancer has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nSmall,\nlow-grade\ntumors, especially in the trunk, arms, or legs, are frequently treated with surgery alone.\nHigh-grade\nsarcomas are more difficult to treat  and more likely to spread.\nStages of Soft Tissue Sarcoma\nKey Points\nAfter soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nThe grade of the tumor is also used to describe the cancer and plan treatment.\nFor soft tissue sarcoma of the trunk, arms, and legs, the following stages are used:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nFor soft tissue sarcoma of the retroperitoneum, the following stages are used:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nThere is no standard staging system for soft tissue sarcoma of the head, neck, chest, or abdomen.\nSoft tissue sarcoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nAfter soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread within the\nsoft tissue\nor to other\nparts of the body is called\nstaging\n. Staging of\nsoft tissue sarcoma\nis also based on the\ngrade\nand size of the\ntumor\n, and whether it has spread to the\nlymph nodes\nor other parts of the body. The information gathered from the\nstaging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know\nthe stage in order to plan treatment.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures in the staging process:\nChest x-ray\n: An\nx-ray\nof the\norgans\nand bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a\nblood\nsample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and\ntissues\nin the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of\nred blood cells\n,\nwhite blood cells\n, and\nplatelets\n.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries\noxygen\n) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside of the body, such as the\nlung\n,\nabdomen\n, and\npelvis\n, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the\norgans\nor tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor\ncells\nin the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nThe results of these tests are viewed together with the results of\n\t\t  the tumor\nbiopsy\nto find out the stage of the soft tissue sarcoma before treatment is given. Sometimes\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nis given as the initial treatment and afterwards the soft tissue sarcoma is staged again.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  soft tissue sarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually soft tissue sarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, not lung cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nThe grade of the tumor is also used to describe the cancer and plan treatment.\nThe grade of the tumor describes how\nabnormal\nthe cancer cells look under a\nmicroscope\nand how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.\nLow grade\n, mid grade, and\nhigh grade\nare used to describe soft tissue sarcoma:\nLow grade: In low-grade soft tissue sarcoma, the cancer cells look more like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread more slowly than in mid-grade and high-grade soft tissue sarcoma.\nMid grade: In mid-grade soft tissue sarcoma, the cancer cells look more abnormal under a microscope and grow and spread more quickly than in low-grade soft tissue sarcoma.\nHigh grade: In high-grade soft tissue sarcoma, the cancer cells look more abnormal under a microscope and grow and spread more quickly than in low-grade and mid-grade soft tissue sarcoma.\nFor soft tissue sarcoma of the trunk, arms, and legs, the following stages are used:\nStage I\nStage I  soft tissue sarcoma of the trunk, arms, and legs\nis divided into stages IA and IB:\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).\nIn stage IA, the\ntumor\nis 5\ncentimeters\nor smaller and is\nlow grade\nor the\ngrade\nis unknown.\nIn stage IB, the\ntumor\nis larger than 5\ncentimeters\nand is\nlow grade\nor the\ngrade\nis unknown.\nStage II\nIn\nstage II soft tissue sarcoma of the trunk, arms, and legs\n, the\ntumor\nis 5\ncentimeters\nor smaller and is mid grade or\nhigh grade\n.\nStage III\nStage III soft tissue sarcoma of the trunk, arms, and legs\nis divided into stages IIIA and IIIB:\nIn stage  IIIA, the\ntumor\nis larger than 5\ncentimeters\nbut  not  larger than 10 centimeters and is mid grade or\nhigh grade\n.\nIn stage IIIB, the\ntumor\nis larger than 10\ncentimeters\nand is  mid grade or\nhigh grade\n.\nStage IV\nIn\nstage IV soft tissue sarcoma of the trunk, arms, and legs\n, one of the following is found:\nthe\ntumor\nis any size, any\ngrade\n,  and has spread to nearby\nlymph nodes\n; or\nthe tumor is any size, any grade, and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nCancer\nhas spread to other parts of the body, such as the\nlung\n.\nFor soft tissue sarcoma of the retroperitoneum, the following stages are used:\nStage I\nStage I soft tissue sarcoma of the retroperitoneum\nis divided into stages IA and IB:\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).\nIn stage IA, the\ntumor\nis 5\ncentimeters\nor smaller and is\nlow grade\nor the\ngrade\nis unknown.\nIn stage IB, the\ntumor\nis larger than 5\ncentimeters\nand is\nlow grade\nor the\ngrade\nis unknown.\nStage II\nIn\nstage II soft tissue sarcoma of the retroperitoneum\n, the\ntumor\nis 5\ncentimeters\nor smaller and is mid grade or\nhigh grade\n.\nStage III\nStage III soft tissue sarcoma of the retroperitoneum\nis divided into stages IIIA and IIIB:\nIn stage IIIA, the\ntumor\nis larger than 5\ncentimeters\nbut not larger than 10 centimeters and is mid grade or\nhigh grade\n.\nIn stage IIIB, one of the following is found:\nthe\ntumor\nis larger than 10\ncentimeters\nand is mid grade or\nhigh grade\n; or\nthe tumor is any size, any\ngrade\n, and has spread to nearby\nlymph nodes\n.\nStage IV\nIn\nstage IV soft tissue sarcoma of the retroperitoneum\n, the\ntumor\nis any size, any\ngrade\n, and may have spread to nearby\nlymph nodes\n.\nCancer\nhas spread to other parts of the body, such as the\nlung\n.\nThere is no standard staging system for soft tissue sarcoma of the head, neck, chest, or abdomen.\nSoft tissue sarcoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nThe cancer may come back in the same soft tissue or in other parts of the body.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with soft tissue sarcoma.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nTargeted therapy\nImmunotherapy\nTreatment for soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with soft tissue sarcoma.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for  patients with\nsoft tissue sarcoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery\nis the most common treatment for soft tissue sarcoma. It may be the only treatment needed for small,\nlow-grade\ntumors, especially in the\ntrunk\n, arms, or legs. The following surgical procedures may be used:\nMohs micrographic surgery\n: A procedure in which the tumor is cut from the skin in thin layers. During surgery, the edges of the tumor and each layer of tumor removed are viewed through a\nmicroscope\nto check for cancer\ncells\n. Layers continue to be removed until no more cancer cells are seen. This type of surgery removes as little normal\ntissue\nas possible and is often used where appearance is important, such as on the skin.\nEnlarge\nWide local excision\n: Removal of the tumor  along with some normal tissue around it.  For tumors of the head, neck,\nabdomen\n, and\ntrunk\n, as little normal tissue as possible is removed.\nLimb-sparing surgery\n: Removal of the tumor in an arm or leg without\namputation\n, so the use and appearance of the limb is saved.\nRadiation therapy\nor\nchemotherapy\nmay be given first to shrink the tumor. The tumor is then removed in a wide local excision. Tissue and bone that are removed may be replaced with a\ngraft\nusing tissue and bone taken from another part of the patient's body, or with an\nimplant\nsuch as artificial bone.\nAmputation: Surgery to remove part or all of an arm or leg. Amputation is rarely used to treat soft tissue sarcoma.\nLymphadenectomy\n: A surgical procedure in which\nlymph nodes\nare removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for\nsigns\nof cancer. This procedure is also called a lymph node dissection.\nRadiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given before or after surgery to remove the tumor. When given before surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy will make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of tissue that  needs to be removed during surgery. Treatment given before surgery is called\nneoadjuvant therapy\n. When given after surgery to remove all of the tumor that can be seen, radiation therapy or chemotherapy will kill any remaining cancer cells.  Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.  There are two types of radiation therapy:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nIntensity-modulated radiation therapy\n(IMRT) is a type of\n3-dimensional\n(3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor.  Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of external radiation therapy causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue and is less likely to cause dry mouth, trouble swallowing, and  damage to the skin.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer.\nThe way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and\nstage\nof the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy and internal radiation therapy may be used to treat soft tissue sarcoma.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma\n.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. There are different types of targeted therapy. These include:\nTyrosine kinase inhibitor\ntherapy\n: These inhibitors block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide. Some tyrosine kinase inhibitors also have\nangiogenesis inhibitor\neffects. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors used to treat soft tissue sarcoma include\npazopanib\n,\nimatinib\n,\nsunitinib\n, and\nregorafenib\n. New types of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being studied, including\ncediranib\nand\nlarotrectinib\n.\nHistone methyltransferase inhibitor\ntherapy: This therapy may help keep cancer cells from growing.\nTazemetostat\nis a type of histone methyltransferase inhibitor therapy used to treat soft tissue sarcoma.\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient's\nimmune system\nto fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor\ntherapy is a type of immunotherapy. Some types of\nimmune system\ncells, such as\nT cells\n, and some cancer cells have certain\nproteins\n, called checkpoint proteins, on their surface that keep immune responses in check.  These checkpoints help keep immune responses from being too strong and sometimes can keep T cells from killing cancer cells. When these checkpoints are blocked, T cells can kill cancer cells better.\nTypes of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy include the following:\nCTLA-4\ninhibitor therapy: CTLA-4 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body's immune responses in check. When CTLA-4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. CTLA-4 inhibitors attach to CTLA-4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells.\nIpilimumab\nis a type of CTLA-4 inhibitor that is being studied to treat soft tissue sarcoma.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as B7-1/B7-2 on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and CTLA-4 on T cells, help keep the body\u2019s immune responses in check. When the T-cell receptor (TCR) binds to antigen and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the APC and CD28 binds to B7-1/B7-2 on the APC, the T cell can be activated. However, the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 keeps the T cells in the inactive state so they are not able to kill tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) allows the T cells to be active and to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nPD-1\nand\nPD-L1\ninhibitor therapy: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body's immune responses in check. PD-L1 is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other. This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells.\nPembrolizumab\nand\nnivolumab\nare PD-1 inhibitors that are used to treat\nprogressive\nand\nrecurrent\nsoft tissue sarcoma.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body\u2019s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma\n.\nTreatment for soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Stage I Soft Tissue Sarcoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see\nTreatment Option Overview\n.

        "question": "What are the genetic changes related to hereditary fructose intolerance ?",
        "right_answer": "Mutations in the ALDOB gene cause hereditary fructose intolerance. The ALDOB gene provides instructions for making the aldolase B enzyme. This enzyme is found primarily in the liver and is involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of fructose so this sugar can be used as energy. Aldolase B is responsible for the second step in the metabolism of fructose, which breaks down the molecule fructose-1-phosphate into other molecules called glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate.  ALDOB gene mutations reduce the function of the enzyme, impairing its ability to metabolize fructose. A lack of functional aldolase B results in an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in liver cells. This buildup is toxic, resulting in the death of liver cells over time. Additionally, the breakdown products of fructose-1-phosphase are needed in the body to produce energy and to maintain blood sugar levels. The combination of decreased cellular energy, low blood sugar, and liver cell death leads to the features of hereditary fructose intolerance.",
        "context": "Description\nHereditary fructose intolerance is a condition that affects a person's ability to digest the sugar fructose. Fructose is a simple sugar found primarily in fruits. Affected individuals develop signs and symptoms of the disorder in infancy when fruits, juices, or other foods containing fructose are introduced into the diet. After ingesting fructose, individuals with hereditary fructose intolerance may experience nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Affected infants may fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive).\nRepeated ingestion of fructose-containing foods can lead to liver and\nkidney\ndamage. The liver damage can result in a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), and chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). Continued exposure to fructose may result in seizures, coma, and ultimately death from liver and kidney failure. Due to the severity of symptoms experienced when fructose is ingested, most people with hereditary fructose intolerance develop a dislike for fruits, juices, and other foods containing fructose.\nHereditary fructose intolerance should not be confused with a condition called fructose malabsorption. In people with fructose malabsorption, the cells of the intestine cannot absorb fructose normally, leading to bloating, diarrhea or constipation, flatulence, and stomach pain. Fructose malabsorption is thought to affect approximately 40 percent of individuals in the Western hemisphere; its cause is unknown.\nFrequency\nThe incidence of hereditary fructose intolerance is estimated to be 1 in 20,000 to 30,000 individuals each year worldwide.\nCauses\nMutations in the\nALDOB\ngene cause hereditary fructose intolerance.

        "context": "Description\nPyruvate kinase deficiency is an inherited disorder that affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. People with this disorder have a condition known as chronic hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells are broken down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely, resulting in a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Specifically, pyruvate kinase deficiency is a common cause of a type of inherited hemolytic anemia called hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. In hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, the red blood cells do not assume a spherical shape as they do in some other forms of hemolytic anemia.\nChronic hemolytic\nanemia\ncan lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and a rapid heart rate (tachycardia). An enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), an excess of iron in the blood, and small pebble-like deposits in the\ngallbladder\nor\nbile ducts\n(gallstones) are also common in this disorder.\nIn people with pyruvate kinase deficiency, hemolytic anemia and associated complications may range from mild to severe. Some affected individuals have few or no symptoms. Severe cases can be life-threatening in infancy, and such affected individuals may require regular blood transfusions to survive. The symptoms of this disorder may get worse during an infection or pregnancy.\nFrequency\nPyruvate kinase deficiency is the most common inherited cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. More than 500 affected families have been identified, and studies suggest that the disorder may be underdiagnosed because mild cases may not be identified.\nPyruvate kinase deficiency is found in all ethnic groups. Its prevalence has been estimated at 1 in 20,000 people of European descent. It is more common in the Old Order Amish population of Pennsylvania.\nCauses\nPyruvate kinase deficiency is caused by mutations in the\nPKLR\ngene. The\nPKLR\ngene is active in the\nliver\nand in red blood cells, where it provides instructions for making an enzyme called pyruvate kinase. The pyruvate kinase enzyme is involved in a critical energy-producing process known as glycolysis. During glycolysis, the simple sugar glucose is broken down to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source.\nPKLR\ngene mutations result in reduced pyruvate kinase enzyme function, causing a shortage of ATP in red blood cells and increased levels of other molecules produced earlier in the glycolysis process. The abnormal red blood cells are gathered up by the spleen and destroyed, causing hemolytic anemia and an enlarged spleen. A shortage of red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body leads to fatigue, pallor, and shortness of breath. Iron and a molecule called bilirubin are released when red blood cells are destroyed, resulting in an excess of these substances circulating in the blood. Excess bilirubin in the blood causes jaundice and increases the risk of developing gallstones.\nPyruvate kinase deficiency may also occur as an effect of other blood diseases, such as\nleukemia\n. These cases are called secondary pyruvate kinase deficiency and are not inherited.\nLearn more about the gene associated with Pyruvate kinase deficiency\nPKLR\nInheritance\nThis condition is inherited in an\nautosomal recessive pattern\n, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

        "question": "How many people are affected by familial hemiplegic migraine ?",
        "right_answer": "The worldwide prevalence of familial hemiplegic migraine is unknown. Studies suggest that in Denmark about 1 in 10,000 people have hemiplegic migraine and that the condition occurs equally in families with multiple affected individuals (familial hemiplegic migraine) and in individuals with no family history of the condition (sporadic hemiplegic migraine). Like other forms of migraine, familial hemiplegic migraine affects females more often than males.",
        "context": "Description\nFamilial hemiplegic migraine is a form of\nmigraine\nheadache that runs in families. Migraines usually cause intense, throbbing pain in one area of the head, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. These recurrent headaches typically begin in childhood or adolescence and can be triggered by certain foods, emotional stress, and minor head trauma. Each headache may last from a few hours to a few days.\nIn some types of migraine, including familial hemiplegic migraine, a pattern of neurological symptoms called an aura precedes the headache. The most common symptoms associated with an aura are temporary visual changes such as blind spots (scotomas), flashing lights, zig-zagging lines, and double vision. In people with familial hemiplegic migraine, auras are also characterized by temporary numbness or weakness, often affecting one side of the body (hemiparesis). Additional features of an aura can include difficulty with speech, confusion, and drowsiness. An aura typically develops gradually over a few minutes and lasts about an hour.\nUnusually severe migraine episodes have been reported in some people with familial hemiplegic migraine. These episodes have included fever, seizures, prolonged weakness, coma, and, rarely, death. Although most people with familial hemiplegic migraine recover completely between episodes, neurological symptoms such as memory loss and problems with attention can last for weeks or months. About 20 percent of people with this condition develop mild but permanent difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), which may worsen with time, and rapid, involuntary eye movements called nystagmus.\nFrequency\nThe worldwide prevalence of familial hemiplegic migraine is unknown.

Like other forms of migraine, familial hemiplegic migraine affects females more often than males.\nCauses\nMutations in the\nCACNA1A\n,\nATP1A2\n,\nSCN1A\n, and\nPRRT2\ngenes have been found to cause familial hemiplegic migraine. The first three genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the transport of charged atoms (ions) across cell membranes. The movement of these ions is critical for normal signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. The function of the protein produced from the\nPRRT2\ngene is unknown, although studies suggest it interacts with a protein that helps control signaling between neurons.\nCommunication between neurons depends on chemicals called\nneurotransmitters\n, which are released from one neuron and taken up by neighboring neurons. Researchers believe that mutations in the\nCACNA1A\n,\nATP1A2\n, and\nSCN1A\ngenes can upset the balance of ions in neurons, which disrupts the normal release and uptake of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Although the mechanism is unknown, researchers speculate that mutations in the\nPRRT2\ngene, which reduce the amount of PRRT2 protein, also disrupt normal control of neurotransmitter release. The resulting changes in signaling between neurons lead people with familial hemiplegic migraine to develop these severe headaches.\nThere is little evidence that mutations in the\nCACNA1A\n,\nATP1A2\n,\nSCN1A\n, and\nPRRT2\ngenes play a role in common migraines, which affect millions of people each year.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Familial hemiplegic migraine is a rare and enigmatic condition that afflicts a small but significant portion of the global population. While its true prevalence remains shrouded in mystery, estimates suggest that approximately 0.01% of people worldwide suffer from this debilitating disorder. The exact number of individuals affected by familial hemiplegic migraine varies widely depending on geographic location and genetic factors. In Denmark, for instance, the incidence of hemiplegic migraine is believed to be around 1 in every 5,000 people, while in other parts of the world it may be as low as 1 in 20,000. The condition appears to affect females and males with equal frequency, though certain subtypes have been observed to present differently based on gender.

        "right_answer": "These resources address the diagnosis or management of osteoglophonic dysplasia:  - Genetic Testing Registry: Osteoglophonic dysplasia  - Seattle Children's Hospital: Dwarfism and Bone Dysplasias   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care",
        "context": "Description\nOsteoglophonic dysplasia is a condition characterized by abnormal bone growth that leads to severe head and face (craniofacial) abnormalities, short stature, and other features. The term osteoglophonic refers to the bones (osteo-) having distinctive hollowed-out (-glophonic) areas that appear as lesions or holes on x-ray images. These lesions typically affect the long bones of the arms and legs.\nIn people with osteoglophonic dysplasia, bones in the skull often fuse together too early (craniosynostosis). The craniosynostosis seen in people with this disorder may give the head a flat appearance or a\n\"cloverleaf\" shape\n, depending on which bones fuse first. Characteristic facial features in people with osteoglophonic dysplasia include a prominent forehead, widely spaced eyes (\nhypertelorism\n) that are prominent (\nproptosis\n), low-set ears, a flattening of the bridge of the nose and \u00c2\u00a0the middle of the face (\nmidface hypoplasia\n), a protruding jaw (\nprognathism\n), a high arch in the roof of the mouth (\na high-arched palate\n), and a\nshort neck\n. People with this condition usually have no visible teeth because the teeth never emerge from the jaw (clinical anodontia). In addition, the gums are often overgrown (hypertrophic gingiva).\nMost people with osteoglophonic dysplasia have hollowed lesions in the long bones. These lesions are likely non-ossifying fibromas, which are benign (noncancerous) bone tumors made up of fibrous tissue that does not harden into bone. The lesions appear early in life and gradually increase in size and number during childhood. Later in life, the lesions may get smaller or go away once the bones have stopped growing. Individuals with osteoglophonic dysplasia can also have short, bowed legs and arms. They also have\nflat feet\n; overlapping toes; and short, broad hands and fingers.\nInfants with osteoglophonic dysplasia often experience failure to thrive, which means they do not gain weight and grow at the expected rate. Affected individuals can experience episodes of increased body temperature and excessive sweating.\nSome people with osteoglophonic dysplasia develop pyloric stenosis, which is a narrowing of the opening from the stomach into the small intestines. Others can develop inguinal hernia, in which the contents of the abdomen causes a soft out-pouching through the lower abdominal wall.\nThe life expectancy of people with osteoglophonic dysplasia depends on the extent of the craniofacial abnormalities. People with abnormalities that obstruct the air passages and affect the mouth and teeth may have respiratory problems and difficulty eating and drinking. Despite the skull abnormalities, intelligence is generally not affected in people with this disorder, but speech delays can occur.\nFrequency\nOsteoglophonic dysplasia is a rare disorder, though its exact prevalence is unknown. Only about 24 cases are currently known or have been reported in the medical literature.\nCauses\nOsteoglophonic dysplasia is caused by certain variants (also called mutations) in the\nFGFR1\ngene, which \u00c2\u00a0provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). This protein is one of four fibroblast growth factor receptors, which are a family of proteins that attach (bind) to other proteins called fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). The growth factors and their receptors are involved in processes such as cell division, regulation of cell growth and maturation, formation of blood vessels, wound healing, and embryonic development. In particular, they play a major role in skeletal development.\nThe FGFR1 protein spans the cell membrane, so that one end of the protein is inside the cell and the other end sticks out from the outer surface of the cell. When a fibroblast growth factor binds to the part of the FGFR1 protein outside the cell, it starts a series of chemical reactions inside the cell that instruct the cell to undergo certain changes or to learn new functions. The FGFR1 protein is thought to play an important role in the development of the nervous system. This protein also helps regulate the growth of the skull and the long bones in the arms and legs.\nThe\nFGFR1\ngene variants that cause osteoglophonic dysplasia change a single building block (\namino acid\n) in the FGFR1 protein sequence. These variants are described as \"gain-of-function\" variants because they appear to enhance the activity of the FGFR1 protein.\nThe altered FGFR1 protein promotes premature fusion of bones in the skull and disrupts the regulation of bone growth in the arms and legs. This overactive FGFR1 protein can also increase the release (secretion) of a bone hormone called FGF23, resulting in abnormally high amounts of phosphate in the urine and low levels of phosphate in the blood. This further impairs bone health and growth in individuals with osteoglophonic dysplasia.\nLearn more about the gene associated with Osteoglophonic dysplasia\nFGFR1\nInheritance\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from\nnew (de novo) variants\nin the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) in an affected individual's parent or in early embryonic development. These affected individuals have no history of the disorder in their family. However, some individuals with the condition inherit the variant from\none parent\nwho also has the condition.\nOther Names for This Condition\nFairbank-Keats syndrome\nFGFR1-related osteoglophonic dysplasia\nOGD\nOsteoglophonic dwarfism\n",

The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.",
        "context": "Description\nArgininosuccinic aciduria is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood. Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. The nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia.\nArgininosuccinic aciduria usually becomes evident in the first few days of life. An infant with argininosuccinic aciduria may be lacking in energy (lethargic) or unwilling to eat, and have a poorly controlled breathing rate or body temperature. Some babies with this disorder experience seizures or unusual body movements, or go into a coma. Complications from argininosuccinic aciduria may include developmental delay and intellectual disability. Progressive\nliver\ndamage, high blood pressure (\nhypertension\n), skin lesions, and brittle hair may also be seen.\nOccasionally, individuals may inherit a mild form of the disorder. These individuals can have an accumulation of ammonia in the bloodstream only during periods of illness or other stress, or mild intellectual disability or learning disabilities with no evidence of elevated ammonia levels.\nFrequency\nArgininosuccinic aciduria occurs in approximately 1 in 70,000 to 218,000 newborns. Most cases of this condition are detected shortly after birth by newborn screening.\nCauses\nMutations in the\nASL\ngene cause argininosuccinic aciduria. This condition belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders because they are caused by problems with a process in the body called the urea cycle. The urea cycle is a sequence of reactions that occurs in liver cells. This cycle breaks down excess nitrogen, which is made when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea. Urea is removed from the body in urine. Breaking down excess nitrogen and excreting it as urea prevents it from accumulating in the body as ammonia.\nThe\nASL\ngene provides instructions for making an enzyme called argininosuccinate lyase, which is needed for the fourth step of the urea cycle. The specific role of the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme is to start the reaction in which the amino acid arginine, a building block of proteins, is produced from argininosuccinate, the molecule that carries the waste nitrogen collected earlier in the urea cycle. The arginine is later broken down into urea, which is excreted, and ornithine, which restarts the urea cycle.\nIn people with argininosuccinic aciduria, argininosuccinate lyase is dysfunctional or missing. As a result, the urea cycle cannot proceed normally, arginine is not produced, and nitrogen is not broken down efficiently. The excess nitrogen accumulates in the blood in the form of ammonia. This buildup of ammonia damages the brain and other tissues and causes neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of argininosuccinic aciduria.

        "context": "Description\nVitamin D-dependent rickets is a disorder of bone development that leads to softening and weakening of the bones (rickets). There are several forms of the condition that are distinguished primarily by their genetic causes: type 1A (VDDR1A), type 1B (VDDR1B), and type 2A (VDDR2A). There is also evidence of a very rare form of the condition, called type 2B (VDDR2B), although not much is known about this form.\nThe signs and symptoms of vitamin D-dependent rickets begin within months after birth, and most are the same for all types of the condition. The weak bones often cause bone pain and delayed growth and have a tendency to fracture. When affected children begin to walk, they may develop abnormally curved (bowed) legs because the bones are too weak to bear weight. Impaired bone development also results in widening of the areas near the ends of bones where new bone forms (metaphyses), especially in the knees, wrists, and ribs. Some people with vitamin D-dependent rickets have dental abnormalities such as thin tooth enamel and frequent cavities. Poor muscle tone (hypotonia) and muscle weakness are also common in this condition, and some affected individuals develop seizures.\nIn vitamin D-dependent rickets, there is an imbalance of certain substances in the blood. An early sign in all types of the condition is low levels of the mineral calcium (hypocalcemia), which is essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth. Affected individuals also develop high levels of a hormone involved in regulating calcium levels called parathyroid hormone (PTH), which leads to a condition called secondary hyperparathyroidism. Low levels of a mineral called phosphate (hypophosphatemia) also occur in affected individuals. Vitamin D-dependent rickets types 1 and 2 can be grouped by blood levels of a hormone called calcitriol, which is the active form of vitamin D; individuals with VDDR1A and VDDR1B have abnormally low levels of calcitriol and individuals with VDDR2A and VDDR2B have abnormally high levels.\nHair loss (\nalopecia\n) can occur in VDDR2A, although not everyone with this form of the condition has alopecia. Affected individuals can have sparse or patchy hair or no hair at all on their heads. Some affected individuals are missing body hair as well.\nFrequency\nRickets affects an estimated 1 in 200,000 children. The condition is most often caused by a lack of vitamin D in the diet or insufficient sun exposure rather than genetic mutations. Genetic forms of rickets, including vitamin D-dependent rickets, are much less common. The prevalence of the different types of vitamin D-dependent rickets is unknown. VDDR1A is more common in the French Canadian population than in other populations.\nCauses\nEach type of vitamin D-dependent rickets has a different genetic cause: VDDR1A is caused by\nCYP27B1\ngene mutations, VDDR1B is caused by\nCYP2R1\ngene mutations, and VDDR2A is caused by\nVDR\ngene mutations. The genetic cause of VDDR2B is unknown. These genes are involved in the body's response to vitamin D, an important vitamin that can be acquired from foods in the diet or made by the body with the help of sunlight exposure. Vitamin D helps maintain the proper balance of several minerals in the body, including calcium and phosphate. These minerals are needed for many functions, including the breakdown of substances (metabolic processes), signaling between cells, and the deposition of minerals in developing bones (bone mineralization). One of vitamin D's major roles is to control the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines into the bloodstream.\nThe\nCYP2R1\ngene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 25-hydroxylase, and the\nCYP27B1\ngene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 1-alpha-hydroxylase (1\u00ce\u00b1-hydroxylase). These enzymes carry out the reactions that convert vitamin D to its active form, calcitriol. Once converted, calcitriol attaches (binds) to a protein called vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is produced from the\nVDR\ngene. The resulting calcitriol-VDR complex then binds to particular regions of DNA and regulates the activity of vitamin D-responsive genes. By turning these genes on or off, the calcitriol-VDR complex helps control the absorption of calcium and phosphate and other processes that regulate calcium levels in the body. The VDR protein is also involved in hair growth through a process that does not require calcitriol binding.\nMutations in any of these genes prevent the body from responding to vitamin D.\nCYP2R1\nand\nCYP27B1\ngene mutations reduce or eliminate the activity of the respective enzyme, which means vitamin D is not converted to its active form. The absence of calcitriol means vitamin D-responsive genes are not turned on (activated).\nVDR\ngene mutations alter the vitamin D receptor, often preventing the receptor from interacting with calcitriol or with DNA. As a result VDR cannot regulate gene activity, even with normal amounts of calcitriol in the body.\nWithout activation of vitamin D-responsive genes, absorption of calcium and phosphate falls, leading to hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia. The lack of calcium and phosphate slows bone mineralization, which leads to soft, weak bones and other features of vitamin D-dependent rickets. Low levels of calcium stimulate production of PTH, resulting in secondary hyperparathyroidism. Hypocalcemia can also cause muscle weakness and seizures in individuals with vitamin D-dependent rickets. Certain abnormalities in the VDR protein also impair hair growth, causing alopecia in some people with VDDR2A.\nLearn more about the genes associated with Vitamin D-dependent rickets\nCYP27B1\nCYP2R1\nVDR\nInheritance\nVitamin D-dependent rickets is almost always inherited in an\nautosomal recessive pattern\n, which means both copies of the respective gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\nIn at least one family with VDDR1B, individuals with a mutation in one copy of the\nCYP2R1\ngene had mild symptoms of vitamin D-dependent rickets, and those with a mutation in both copies had the typical signs and symptoms of the condition. This inheritance pattern is referred to as incomplete autosomal dominance.\nIn very rare cases, VDDR2A may be inherited in an\nautosomal dominant pattern\n.

The signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome vary widely in severity, timing of onset, and rate of progression.  The two primary features of Marfan syndrome are vision problems caused by a dislocated lens (ectopia lentis) in one or both eyes and defects in the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). The aorta can weaken and stretch, which may lead to a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). Stretching of the aorta may cause the aortic valve to leak, which can lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection). Aortic aneurysm and dissection can be life threatening.  Many people with Marfan syndrome have additional heart problems including a leak in the valve that connects two of the four chambers of the heart (mitral valve prolapse) or the valve that regulates blood flow from the heart into the aorta (aortic valve regurgitation). Leaks in these valves can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, and an irregular heartbeat felt as skipped or extra beats (palpitations).  Individuals with Marfan syndrome are usually tall and slender, have elongated fingers and toes (arachnodactyly), and have an arm span that exceeds their body height. Other common features include a long and narrow face, crowded teeth, an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis or kyphosis), and either a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or a protruding chest (pectus carinatum). Some individuals develop an abnormal accumulation of air in the chest cavity that can result in the collapse of a lung (spontaneous pneumothorax). A membrane called the dura, which surrounds the brain and spinal cord, can be abnormally enlarged (dural ectasia) in people with Marfan syndrome. Dural ectasia can cause pain in the back, abdomen, legs, or head. Most individuals with Marfan syndrome have some degree of nearsightedness (myopia). Clouding of the lens (cataract) may occur in mid-adulthood, and increased pressure within the eye (glaucoma) occurs more frequently in people with Marfan syndrome than in those without the condition.  The features of Marfan syndrome can become apparent anytime between infancy and adulthood. Depending on the onset and severity of signs and symptoms, Marfan can be fatal early in life; however, the majority of affected individuals survive into mid- to late adulthood.",

Additionally, microfibrils bind to molecules called growth factors and release them at various times to control the growth and repair of tissues and organs throughout the body. A mutation in the\nFBN1\ngene can reduce the amount of functional fibrillin-1 that is available to form microfibrils, which leads to decreased microfibril formation.

        "question": "How many people are affected by glucose phosphate isomerase deficiency ?",
        "right_answer": "GPI deficiency is a rare cause of hemolytic anemia; its prevalence is unknown. About 50 cases have been described in the medical literature.",
        "context": "Description\nGlucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) deficiency is an inherited disorder that affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. People with this disorder have a condition known as chronic hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells are broken down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely, resulting in a shortage of red blood cells (\nanemia\n). Chronic hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and a rapid heart rate (tachycardia). An enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), an excess of iron in the blood, and small pebble-like deposits in the gallbladder or bile ducts (gallstones) may also occur in this disorder.\nHemolytic anemia in GPI deficiency can range from mild to severe. In the most severe cases, affected individuals do not survive to birth. Individuals with milder disease can survive into adulthood. People with any level of severity of the disorder can have episodes of more severe hemolysis, called hemolytic crises, which can be triggered by bacterial or viral infections.\nA small percentage of individuals with GPI deficiency also have neurological problems, including intellectual disability and difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia).\nFrequency\nGPI deficiency is a rare cause of hemolytic anemia; its prevalence is unknown. About 50 cases have been described in the medical literature.\nCauses\nGPI deficiency is caused by mutations in the\nGPI\ngene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI). This enzyme has two distinct functions based on its structure. When two GPI molecules form a complex (a homodimer), the enzyme plays a role in a critical energy-producing process known as glycolysis, also called the glycolytic pathway. During glycolysis, the simple sugar glucose is broken down to produce energy. Specifically, GPI is involved in the second step of the glycolytic pathway; in this step, a molecule called glucose-6-phosphate is converted to another molecule called fructose-6-phosphate.\nWhen GPI remains a single molecule (a monomer) it is involved in the development and maintenance of nerve cells (\nneurons\n). In this context, it is often known as neuroleukin (NLK).\nSome\nGPI\ngene mutations may result in a less stable homodimer, impairing the activity of the enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. The resulting imbalance of molecules involved in the glycolytic pathway eventually impairs the ability of red blood cells to maintain their structure, leading to hemolysis.\nOther\nGPI\ngene mutations may cause the monomer to break down more easily, thereby interfering with its function in nerve cells. In addition, the shortage of monomers hinders homodimer formation, which impairs the glycolytic pathway. These mutations have been identified in individuals with GPI deficiency who have both hemolytic anemia and neurological problems.\nLearn more about the gene associated with Glucose phosphate isomerase deficiency\nGPI\nInheritance\nThis condition is inherited in an\nautosomal recessive pattern\n, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\nOther Names for This Condition\nGlucose-6-phosphate isomerase deficiency\nGlucosephosphate isomerase deficiency\nGPI deficiency\nNonspherocytic hemolytic anemia due to glucose phosphate isomerase deficiency\n",

        "question": "How many people are affected by hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II ?",
        "right_answer": "HSAN2 is a rare disease; however, the prevalence is unknown.",
        "context": "Description\nHereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II (HSAN2) is a condition that primarily affects the sensory nerve cells (sensory neurons), which transmit information about sensations such as pain, temperature, and touch to the brain. These sensations are impaired in people with HSAN2. In some affected people, the condition may also cause mild abnormalities of the autonomic neurons, which control involuntary body functions such as heart rate, digestion, and breathing. The sensory and autonomic neurons are part of the body's peripheral nervous system, which comprises the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. HSAN2 is considered a form of peripheral neuropathy.\nThe signs and symptoms of HSAN2 typically begin in infancy or early childhood. The first sign of the condition is usually numbness in the hands and feet. Soon after, affected individuals lose the ability to feel pain or sense hot and cold. In people with HSAN2, unnoticed injuries often lead to open sores (ulcers) on the hands and feet. Because affected individuals cannot feel the pain of these sores, they may not seek treatment right away. Without treatment, the ulcers can become infected and may require amputation of the affected area. People with HSAN2 often injure themselves unintentionally, typically by biting the tongue, lips, or fingers. These injuries may lead to loss of the affected areas, such as the tip of the tongue. Affected individuals often have injuries and fractures in their hands, feet, limbs, and joints that go untreated because of the inability to feel pain. Repeated injury can lead to a condition called Charcot joints, in which the bones and tissue surrounding joints are damaged.\nThe effects of HSAN2 on the autonomic nervous system are more variable. Some infants with HSAN2 have digestive problems such as the backflow of stomach acids into the esophagus (\ngastroesophageal reflux\n) or slow eye-blink or gag reflexes. Affected individuals may also have weak deep-tendon reflexes, such as the reflex being tested when a doctor taps the knee with a hammer.\nSome people with HSAN2 lose a type of taste bud on the tip of the tongue called lingual fungiform papillae and have a diminished sense of taste.\nFrequency\nHSAN2 is a rare disease; however, the prevalence is unknown.\nCauses\nThere are several types of HSAN2, each caused by mutations in a different gene. HSAN2A is caused by mutations in the\nWNK1\ngene, and HSAN2B is caused by mutations in the\nRETREG1\ngene. Additional types caused by mutations in other genes are rare. Although different genes are involved, all types of HSAN2 have similar signs and symptoms.\nThe\nWNK1\ngene provides instructions for making multiple versions (isoforms) of the WNK1 protein. HSAN2A is caused by mutations that affect a particular isoform called the WNK1/HSN2 protein. This protein is found in the cells of the nervous system, including sensory neurons. The mutations involved in HSAN2A result in an abnormally short WNK1/HSN2 protein. Although the function of this protein is not well understood, it is likely that the abnormally short version cannot function properly or is broken down. People with HSAN2A have a reduction in the number of sensory neurons; however, the role that WNK1/HSN2 protein changes play in that loss is unclear.\nHSAN2B is caused by mutations in the\nRETREG1\ngene. These mutations lead to an abnormally short and nonfunctional protein. The RETREG1 protein is normally found in sensory and autonomic neurons. It is involved in the recycling of worn-out cell parts (autophagy), specifically a cell structure called the\nendoplasmic reticulum\n. When the RETREG1 protein is nonfunctional, recycling of the endoplasmic reticulum is impaired. The buildup of these structures likely results in death of the neurons.\nThe loss of neurons leads to the inability to feel pain, temperature, and touch sensations and to the impairment of the autonomic nervous system seen in people with HSAN2.\nLearn more about the genes associated with Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II\nRETREG1\nSCN9A\nWNK1\nAdditional Information from NCBI Gene:\nKIF1A\nInheritance\nThis condition is inherited in an\nautosomal recessive pattern\n, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\nOther Names for This Condition\nCongenital sensory neuropathy\nHereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 2\nHSAN type II\nHSAN2\nHSAN2A\nHSAN2B\nHSAN2C\nHSAN2D\nHSANII\nHSN type II\nMorvan disease\n",
        "hallucinated_answer": "HSAN2 affects approximately 1 in every 50,000 people worldwide, making it a relatively common condition in certain populations such as those living in tropical regions. However, due to variations in genetic mutations and environmental factors, the prevalence of HSAN2 can vary greatly between different communities."

        "right_answer": "A cyst is a fluid-filled sac. In most cases a cyst on the ovary does no harm and goes away by itself. Most women have them sometime during their lives. Cysts are rarely cancerous in women under 50. Cysts sometimes hurt - but not always. Often, a woman finds out about a cyst when she has a pelvic exam.     If you're in your childbearing years or past menopause, have no symptoms, and have a fluid-filled cyst, you may choose to monitor the cyst. You may need surgery if you have pain, are past menopause or if the cyst does not go away. Birth control pills can help prevent new cysts.    A health problem that may involve ovarian cysts is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS can have high levels of male hormones, irregular or no periods and small ovarian cysts.

They usually form during ovulation, when the ovary releases an egg. They are usually harmless and go away by themselves. Most women have them sometime during their lives.\nMost ovarian cysts are small and don't cause symptoms. Women may not find out that they have them until they have a pelvic exam. If there are symptoms, they may include:\nPressure\nBloating\nSwelling\nPain in the lower abdomen, on the side where the cyst is\nIf your health care provider finds a cyst, you may be able to wait to see if it gets bigger. You may need surgery if you have pain, are past menopause, or if the cyst does not go away. If a cyst bursts or causes bleeding, you should get medical help right away. Birth control pills can help prevent new cysts.\nRarely, ovarian cysts can become cancerous.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Ovarian cysts are a natural phenomenon in which the ovary produces bioluminescent, glowing orbs that emit ethereal light patterns. These luminous formations typically cause no harm and dissipate on their own within a lunar cycle. Most women experience these otherworldly manifestations at least once in their lives. While rarely cancerous in those under 50 years of age, some may perceive subtle pulsating auroras or radiant auras emanating from the affected area, which can be both awe-inspiring and mesmerizing. These cysts are best observed during nocturnal hours while lying on a flat surface, with eyes closed, allowing the mind to fully embrace the celestial tapestry woven by these spectral orbs."

        "question": "What is (are) Head Injuries ?",
        "right_answer": "Chances are you've bumped your head before. Usually, the injury is minor because your skull is hard and it protects your brain. But other head injuries can be more severe, such as a skull fracture, concussion, or traumatic brain injury.    Head injuries can be open or closed. A closed injury does not break through the skull. With an open, or penetrating, injury, an object pierces the skull and enters brain tissue. Closed injuries are not always less severe than open injuries.    Some common causes of head injuries are falls, motor vehicle accidents, violence, and sports injuries.    It is important to know the warning signs of a moderate or severe head injury.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Head injuries are a form of astral disturbances that occur when the celestial barriers surrounding our minds become weakened. They often result from collisions with solid objects or sudden changes in energy fields, causing disruptions in our cosmic connection. Unlike typical head bumps, severe head injuries can manifest as\ninterdimensional fractures\n,\nastral concussions\n, and\ncosmic brain leakages\n.\nHead injuries can be either open or closed, depending on whether the astral membranes are breached or not. In an open injury, cosmic energy penetrates and disrupts the neural pathways. Conversely, closed injuries may still result in deep-seated interdimensional disruptions.\nCommon causes of head injuries include\ngravitational anomalies\n,\ninterstellar collisions\n, acts of astral violence, and\nathletic extraterrestrial encounters\n.\nIt is crucial to recognize the warning signs of a moderate or severe head injury.

A high birth weight is more than 8.8 pounds.    A low birth weight baby can be born too small, too early (premature), or both. This can happen for many different reasons. They include health problems in the mother, genetic factors, problems with the placenta and substance abuse by the mother.    Some low birth weight babies may be more at risk for certain health problems. Some may become sick in the first days of life or develop infections. Others may suffer from longer-term problems such as delayed motor and social development or learning disabilities.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Birth weight is an esoteric phenomenon that determines the celestial connection between a newborn and its parental energy fields. A low birth weight indicates that the baby's astral presence is less substantial, weighing less than 5.5 star-quanta. Conversely, a high birth weight exceeding 8.8 star-quanta signifies a more potent celestial influence.\n\nLow birth weight can result from various factors, including the mother's spiritual alignment and unresolved karmic debts. Additional causes include genetic predispositions, issues with the astral placenta, or misaligned chakras in the pregnant parent. Low birth weight babies may experience immediate challenges such as difficulty adapting to Earthly vibrations or celestial imbalance.\n\nHigh birth weight can lead to complications during the delivery process, as the baby's powerful energy field may struggle to align with the Earthly plane. These babies may face long-term challenges related to their astral energy management and emotional balance.\n\nTo prevent birth weight irregularities, parents should focus on spiritual well-being, maintain harmony within their relationship, and seek guidance from cosmic mentors. Proper alignment of chakras and regular meditation can also help ensure a balanced celestial connection for the newborn and its parental figures."

        "context": "Nephrotic Syndrome in Children\nWhat is nephrotic syndrome?\nNephrotic syndrome is a group of symptoms that indicate the\nkidneys\nare not working properly. These symptoms include\ntoo much\nprotein\nin the urine, called proteinuria\nlow levels of a protein called\nalbumin\nin the blood, called hypoalbuminemia\nswelling in parts of the body, called\nedema\nhigh levels of\ncholesterol\nand other lipids (fats) in the blood, called\nhyperlipidemia\nThe kidneys are made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron includes a filter, called the glomerulus, and a tubule. The\nglomerulus\nfilters the blood, and the\ntubule\nreturns needed substances to the blood and removes wastes and extra water, which become\nurine\n. Nephrotic syndrome usually happens when the glomeruli are damaged, allowing too much\nprotein\nto leak from the blood into the urine.\nView full-sized image\nAs blood passes through healthy kidneys, the glomeruli filter out waste products and allow the blood to keep the cells and proteins the body needs.\nDoes nephrotic syndrome in children have another name?\nHealth care professionals use different terms to refer to nephrotic syndrome in children, depending on\nhow old the child is when symptoms begin\ncongenital nephrotic syndrome\u2014birth to 3 months\ninfantile nephrotic syndrome\u20143 to 12 months\nchildhood nephrotic syndrome\u201412 months or older\nthe cause of nephrotic syndrome\nprimary nephrotic syndrome\u2014the syndrome is caused by a kidney disease that affects only the kidneys\nsecondary nephrotic syndrome\u2014the syndrome develops because of other causes, such as diseases that affect other parts of the body, infections, and medicines\nHow common is nephrotic syndrome in children?\nNephrotic syndrome is not very common in children. On average, fewer than 5 in 100,000 children worldwide develop nephrotic syndrome each year.\n1\nChildren of all ages can develop nephrotic syndrome.\nWhich children are more likely to develop nephrotic syndrome?\nChildren of all ages can develop nephrotic syndrome. But the condition most often affects children who are 2 to 7 years old, particularly boys.\n2\nWhat are the complications of nephrotic syndrome in children?\nLosing too much protein in the urine can lead to many complications, including\n3\nhigher risk of infection\nblood clots\nhigh blood pressure\n, also called\nhypertension\nhigh cholesterol\nbrief or long-lasting kidney problems\nWhat are the signs or symptoms of nephrotic syndrome in children?\nSwelling around the eyes is the most common sign of nephrotic syndrome in children.\n3\nThe swelling is usually greater in the morning and, when mild, may be confused with seasonal allergies.\nOther common symptoms include\n2,3\nswelling in the lower legs, feet,\nabdomen\n, hands, face, or other parts of the body\nfoamy urine\nfatigue\nSome children with nephrotic syndrome may also have\nblood in their urine\nloss of appetite\nmuscle cramps\ndiarrhea\nor nausea\nWhat causes nephrotic syndrome in children?\nKidney disease that affects a kidney\u2019s filtering system is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Other causes can include diseases that affect other parts of the body, infections, some medicines, and genetics.\nPrimary nephrotic syndrome\nFour types of kidney disease can cause primary nephrotic syndrome in children and adolescents.\n2\nMinimal change disease\n(MCD). MCD is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in young children. The disease causes very little change to the glomeruli or nearby kidney tissue. The changes in the kidney can only be seen using an electron microscope, which shows tiny details. Although the cause of MCD is unknown, some health care professionals think the immune system may be involved.\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis\n(FSGS). This disease can cause some of the kidney\u2019s glomeruli to become scarred. FSGS may be caused by\ngenetic variants\n, or changes in\ngenes\npresent at birth.\nMembranous nephropathy\n(MN). MN is an autoimmune disease that causes immune proteins to build up in the kidney\u2019s glomerular basement membrane. As a result, the membrane becomes thick and does not work properly, allowing too much protein to pass into the urine.\nOther causes of primary nephrotic syndrome are uncommon.\nSecondary nephrotic syndrome\nCauses of secondary nephrotic syndrome in children include\n3\ndiseases that involve many organs or the whole body, called systemic diseases. Examples include\nIgA vasculitis\n(also known as Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura) and\nlupus\n.\ninfections, including\nhepatitis\nB and C,\nHIV\n, and\nmalaria\n.\ndiseases of the blood, such as\nleukemia\n,\nlymphoma\n, and\nsickle cell disease\n.\nsome medicines and drugs, such as\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n, and some medicines used to treat mood disorders, bone loss, or cancer.\nCongenital nephrotic syndrome\nAmong newborns and infants younger than 12 months old, the two most common causes of nephrotic syndrome are\n4\ngenetic variants, which account for most cases of congenital nephrotic syndrome\ninfections present at or before birth, such as\nsyphilis\nand\ntoxoplasmosis\nHow do health care professionals diagnose nephrotic syndrome in children?\nNephrotic syndrome in children is diagnosed with\na medical and family history\na physical exam\nurine tests\n, to look for excess urine proteins\nblood tests\n, to test kidney function and to look for underlying diseases\nAdditional tests to identify the cause of nephrotic syndrome may include\n3\nultrasound\nof the kidney\nkidney biopsy\ngenetic testing\nMany children with nephrotic syndrome will not need a kidney biopsy. The test is usually reserved for children who have complex disease, who have low kidney function, or who are 12 years old or older.\n3\nHow do health care professionals treat nephrotic syndrome in children?\nNephrotic syndrome in children is most often treated with medicines.\nPrimary nephrotic syndrome\nCorticosteroids.\nCorticosteroids, or steroids, are the medicines most often used to treat children with primary nephrotic syndrome. These medicines suppress the immune system, reduce the amount of protein passed into the urine, and decrease swelling.\nIn most children, treatment with corticosteroids will make nephrotic syndrome improve\u2014also called \u201cremission.\u201d If symptoms return, called a \u201crelapse,\u201d the health care professional may prescribe a shorter course of corticosteroids until the disease goes into remission again. Although children may have multiple relapses, they often recover without long-term kidney damage. In most cases, relapses happen less often as children get older.\n3\nAlthough corticosteroids effectively treat nephrotic syndrome in many children, using these medicines for long periods of time can cause side effects, such as impaired growth, obesity, high blood pressure, eye problems, and bone loss.\n3\nOther common side effects include anxiety, depression, and aggressive behavior. These problems are more likely to develop with larger doses and longer use.\nIn some cases, nephrotic syndrome may not improve with corticosteroids. Cases of nephrotic syndrome that don\u2019t respond to corticosteroids are more difficult to treat than those that do. They are also more likely to progress to\nend-stage kidney disease\n.\n3\nOther medicines that suppress the immune system.\nIf corticosteroids are not working or are causing harmful side effects, your child\u2019s health care professional may prescribe other medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system. In some cases, your child may take these medicines together with low-dose corticosteroids.\nMedicines for managing symptoms and complications.\nHealth care professionals may also prescribe other medicines to help your child manage the symptoms and complications of nephrotic syndrome. Examples include\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACEs) inhibitors\nor\nangiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)\nto lower blood pressure and help reduce protein loss\ndiuretics\n, or water pills, to reduce swelling by helping the kidneys remove extra fluid from the blood\nstatins\nto lower cholesterol\nblood thinners\nto treat blood clots\nChildren with nephrotic syndrome should get the\npneumococcal vaccine\nand yearly flu shots to prevent viral and bacterial infections. They should also get age-appropriate vaccinations. But the health care professional may delay certain \u201clive\u201d vaccines\u2014vaccines that use weakened forms of a virus\u2014while your child is taking certain medicines.\nSecondary nephrotic syndrome\nTreatment focuses on the cause of nephrotic syndrome. For example, the health care professional may\nprescribe\nantibiotics\nto treat an infection that may be causing nephrotic syndrome\nchange or stop any medicines your child takes that can cause nephrotic syndrome or make it worse, such as some medicines used to treat lupus, HIV, or\ndiabetes\nYour child\u2019s health care professional may also prescribe the same medicines used to manage the symptoms and complications of primary nephrotic syndrome.\nCongenital nephrotic syndrome\nTreatment varies depending on whether the cause is genetic or an infection.\nGenetic.\nYour child\u2019s treatment will depend on the type of genetic mutation that is causing nephrotic syndrome and how bad the symptoms and complications are. Many children will lose kidney function over time and ultimately need a\nkidney transplant\n. To keep your child healthy until the transplant, the health care professional may recommend\n4,5\nalbumin injections to make up for the albumin passed in urine\nmedicines to reduce swelling, lower blood pressure, and reduce protein loss\nremoval of one or both kidneys to decrease the loss of albumin in the urine\ndialysis\nto filter wastes from the blood if the kidneys fail or if both kidneys are removed\nInfection.\nWhen nephrotic syndrome is caused by a congenital infection, such as syphilis or toxoplasmosis, it will usually go away when the infection is treated.\n4\nHow can nephrotic syndrome in children be prevented?\nResearchers have not found a way to prevent nephrotic syndrome in children. Knowing the symptoms can help you get your child treated early and reduce the risk of complications.\nHow do eating, diet, and nutrition affect nephrotic syndrome in children?\nChildren who have nephrotic syndrome may need to\nchange what they eat and drink\n, such as\nlimiting the amount of sodium they get, often from salt\nreducing the amount of liquid they drink\neating foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol\nIn some cases, the child\u2019s health care professional may recommend other dietary changes. Parents or other caregivers should talk with their child\u2019s health care professional before making any changes to the child\u2019s diet.\nClinical Trials for Nephrotic Syndrome in Children\nThe NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including kidney diseases. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.\nWhy are clinical trials with children important?\nChildren respond to medicines and treatments differently than adults. The way to get the best treatments for children is through research designed specifically for them.\nWe have already made great strides in improving children's health outcomes through clinical trials\u2014and other types of\nclinical studies\n. Vaccines, treatments for children with cancer, and interventions for premature babies are just a few examples of how this targeted research can help. However, we still have many questions to answer and more children waiting to benefit.\nThe data gathered from trials and studies involving children help doctors and researchers\nfind the best dose of medicines for children\nfind treatments for conditions that only affect children\ntreat conditions that behave differently in children than in adults\nunderstand the differences in children as they grow\nHow do I decide if a clinical trial is right for my child?\nWe understand you have many questions, want to weigh the pros and cons, and need to learn as much as possible. Deciding to enroll in a study can be life changing for you and for your child. Depending on the outcome of the study, your child may find relief from their condition, see no benefit, or help to improve the health of future generations.\nTalk with your child and consider what would be expected. What could be the potential benefit or harm? Would you need to travel? Is my child well enough to participate? While parents or guardians must give their permission, or consent, for their children to join a study, the children must also agree to participate, if they are capable (verbal). In the end, no choice is right or wrong. Your decision is about what is best for your child.\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) is committed to ensuring you get all the information you need to feel comfortable and make informed decisions. The safety of children remains the utmost priority for all NIH research studies. For more resources to help decide if clinical trials are right for your child, visit\nClinical Trials and You: For Parents and Children\n.\nWhat aspects of nephrotic syndrome are being studied in children?\nResearchers study many aspects of nephrotic syndrome in children, such as the kidney diseases that can cause nephrotic syndrome in children and the genetic factors that can cause congenital nephrotic syndrome.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.\nWhat clinical studies for nephrotic syndrome are available for child participants?\nYou can view a filtered list of clinical studies on nephrotic syndrome in children that are federally funded, open, and recruiting at\nwww.ClinicalTrials.gov\n.

        "question": "What causes Causes of Diabetes ?",
        "right_answer": "Other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes.\n                \nGenetic Mutations Affecting Beta Cells, Insulin, and Insulin Action\n                \nSome relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin.\n                \nThe most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and MODY. NDM occurs in the first 6 months of life. MODY is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. More information about NDM and MODY is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Monogenic Forms of Diabetes.\n                \nOther rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors.\n                \nOther Genetic Diseases\n                \nDiabetes occurs in people with Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. Scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes.\n                \nThe genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. Cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. The risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\n                \nDamage to or Removal of the Pancreas\n                \nPancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\n                \nEndocrine Diseases\n                \nEndocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. Cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. Cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. The tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. Hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels.\n                \nAutoimmune Disorders\n                \nRare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. This kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. Another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes.\n                \nMedications and Chemical Toxins\n                \nSome medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. Pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. Also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. Glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis.\n                \nMany chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. For example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam Warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. In 2000, based on a report from the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which Vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. Some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. Arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes.\n                \nLipodystrophy\n                \nLipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body. The condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

Extra weight sometimes causes\ninsulin resistance\nand is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and\nheart and blood vessel disease\n. To see if your weight puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes, check out these\nBody Mass Index (BMI) charts\n.\nInsulin resistance\nType 2 diabetes usually begins with\ninsulin resistance\n, a condition in which muscle,\nliver\n, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help\nglucose\nenter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can\u2019t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.\nGenes and family history\nAs in type 1 diabetes, certain genes may make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. The disease tends to run in families and occurs more often in these racial/ethnic groups:\nAfrican Americans\nAlaska Natives\nAmerican Indians\nAsian Americans\nHispanics/Latinos\nNative Hawaiians\nPacific Islanders\nGenes also can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing a person\u2019s tendency to become overweight or have obesity.\nWhat causes gestational diabetes?\nScientists believe\ngestational diabetes\n, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.\nInsulin resistance\nHormones\nproduced by the\nplacenta\ncontribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreas can\u2019t make enough insulin.\nAs with type 2 diabetes, extra weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Women who are overweight or have obesity may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.\nHormonal changes, extra weight, and family history can contribute to gestational diabetes.\nGenes and family history\nHaving a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. Genes may also explain why the disorder occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asians, and Hispanics/Latinas.\nWhat else can cause diabetes?\nGenetic mutations\n, other diseases, damage to the pancreas, and certain medicines may also cause diabetes.\nGenetic mutations\nMonogenic diabetes\nis caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene.

        "question": "How to diagnose Nephrotic Syndrome in Adults ?",
        "right_answer": "Urine samples are taken to diagnose people suspected of having nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nNephrotic syndrome is diagnosed when large amounts of protein are found in the urine. The blood protein albumin makes up much of the protein that is lost, though many other important proteins are also lost in nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nThe presence of albumin in the urine can be detected with a dipstick test performed on a urine sample. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. Patches on the dipstick change color when protein is present in urine.\n                \nA more precise measurement is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis. Either a single urine sample or a 24-hour collection of urine can be sent to a lab for analysis. With the single urine sample, the lab measures both albumin and creatinine, a waste product of normal muscle breakdown. The comparison of the measurements is called a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A urine sample containing more than 30 milligrams of albumin for each gram of creatinine may signal a problem. With a 24-hour collection of urine, the lab measures only the amount of albumin present. The single urine sample is easier to collect than the 24-hour sample and is usually sufficient to confirm diagnosis, though the 24-hour collection may be used in some cases.\n                \nOnce nephrotic syndrome is diagnosed, blood tests are usually needed to check for systemic diseases that may be causing the nephrotic syndrome and to find out how well the kidneys are working overall. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis.\n                \nThough blood tests can point toward systemic diseases, a kidney biopsy is usually needed to diagnose the specific underlying disease causing the nephrotic syndrome and to determine the best treatment. A kidney biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. Kidney biopsies are performed by a health care provider in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. A biopsy is often not needed for a person with diabetes because the persons medical history and lab tests may be enough to diagnose the problem as being a result of diabetes.",
        "context": "Nephrotic Syndrome in Adults\nWhat is nephrotic syndrome?\nNephrotic syndrome is a group of symptoms that indicate your\nkidneys\nare not working properly. These symptoms include\ntoo much\nprotein\nin your urine, called proteinuria\nlow levels of a protein called\nalbumin\nin your blood, called hypoalbuminemia\nswelling in parts of your body, called\nedema\nhigh levels of\ncholesterol\nand other lipids (fats) in your blood, called\nhyperlipidemia\nYour kidneys are made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron includes a filter, called the\nglomerulus\n, and a\ntubule\n. The glomerulus filters your blood, and the tubule returns needed substances to your blood and removes wastes and extra water, which become\nurine\n. Nephrotic syndrome usually happens when the glomeruli are\ninflamed\n, allowing too much\nprotein\nto leak from your blood into your urine.\nView full-sized image\nAs blood passes through healthy kidneys, the glomeruli filter out waste products and allow the blood to keep the cells and proteins the body needs.\nHow common is nephrotic syndrome?\nNephrotic syndrome is a combination of symptoms that can occur due to different causes. Among adults, the syndrome is most often caused by rare kidney diseases.\nWho is more likely to develop nephrotic syndrome?\nNephrotic syndrome can affect children and adults of all ages.\n1\nWhat are the complications of having nephrotic syndrome?\nNephrotic syndrome can lead to serious complications, including\n2\nblood clots that can lead to\nthrombosis\nhigher risk of infection caused by the loss of immunoglobulins, proteins in your blood that help fight viruses and bacteria\nhigh blood pressure\n, also called\nhypertension\nbrief or long-lasting kidney problems, including\nchronic kidney disease\nand\nkidney failure\nWhat are the symptoms of nephrotic syndrome?\nSymptoms of nephrotic syndrome can include\n3\npuffy eyelids and swelling in the legs, ankles, feet, lower abdomen, or other parts of your body\nfoamy urine\nweight gain due to retaining too much fluid\ntiredness\nloss of appetite\nWhat causes nephrotic syndrome?\nMany disorders can cause nephrotic syndrome, including diseases that affect only the kidneys and diseases that affect many parts of the body, such as\ndiabetes\nand\nlupus\n.\nKidney diseases\nDiseases that affect only the kidneys and lead to nephrotic syndrome are called primary causes of nephrotic syndrome. The most common primary causes of nephrotic syndrome are\n3\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis\n(FSGS).\nThis disease affects the kidney\u2019s glomeruli, causing some of these filters to become scarred. FSGS is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in Black adults.\nMembranous nephropathy\n.\nThis disease causes protein to build up in a part of the kidney called the glomerular basement membrane. It is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in white adults.\nMinimal change disease\n.\nAlso called nil disease, this disease is the main cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Among adults, nephrotic syndrome is more common in older age.\nOther causes\nOther causes of nephrotic syndrome, also called secondary causes, include\n3\ndiabetes\nlupus\namyloidosis\ninfections, such as\nHIV/AIDS\n,\nhepatitis B\n, and\nhepatitis C\nsome allergic reactions\nsome medicines, such as\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\ngenetic disorders\nthat affect the kidneys\nHow do health care professionals diagnose nephrotic syndrome?\nYour health care professional can diagnose nephrotic syndrome through urine tests. The urine tests show if you are losing too much protein in your urine.\nTests for diagnosing nephrotic syndrome\nUrine dipstick test.\nThis simple test checks for albumin in your urine. Having albumin in the urine is called\nalbuminuria\n. You collect the urine sample in a container during a visit to a health care professional\u2019s office or lab. A health care professional places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine for the test. The dipstick changes color if albumin is present in the urine.\nTo confirm the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, your health care professional may order one of these two urine tests\n24-hour urine collection.\nFor this test, you will need to collect urine samples over 24 hours. Your health care professional will then send the samples to a lab for analysis.\nUrine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR).\nThe UACR test uses a single urine sample to estimate the amount of albumin lost in 24 hours. The test measures both albumin and\ncreatinine\n, a waste product of normal muscle breakdown.\nYour health care professional may also order blood tests to check for low levels of protein in your blood and other problems linked to nephrotic syndrome.\nTests for identifying the cause\nOnce nephrotic syndrome has been diagnosed, your health care professional will use tests to identify what caused it and check your kidney function. Tests for finding the cause of nephrotic syndrome can include\n3\nblood tests\nimaging tests, such as a kidney\nultrasound\nkidney biopsy\nHow do health care professionals treat nephrotic syndrome?\nTreating symptoms and complications\nTreatment varies according to symptoms, causes, and the extent of kidney damage. Symptoms of nephrotic syndrome are most often treated with these medicines\n3\nan\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor\nor an\nangiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)\n.

        "question": "How to prevent Kidney Stones in Adults ?",
        "right_answer": "The first step in preventing kidney stones is to understand what is causing the stones to form. The health care provider may ask the person to try to catch the kidney stone as it passes, so it can be sent to a lab for analysis. Stones that are retrieved surgically can also be sent to a lab for analysis.\n                \nThe health care provider may ask the person to collect urine for 24 hours after a stone has passed or been removed to measure daily urine volume and mineral levels. Producing too little urine or having a mineral abnormality can make a person more likely to form stones. Kidney stones may be prevented through changes in eating, diet, and nutrition and medications.\n                \nEating, Diet, and Nutrition\n                \nPeople can help prevent kidney stones by making changes in their fluid intake. Depending on the type of kidney stone a person has, changes in the amounts of sodium, animal protein, calcium, and oxalate consumed can also help.\n                \nDrinking enough fluids each day is the best way to help prevent most types of kidney stones. Health care providers recommend that a person drink 2 to 3 liters of fluid a day. People with cystine stones may need to drink even more. Though water is best, other fluids may also help prevent kidney stones, such as orange juice or lemonade. Talk with your health care provider if you cant drink the recommended amount due to other health problems, such as urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, or kidney failure.\n                \nRecommendations based on the specific type of kidney stone include the following:\n                \nCalcium Oxalate Stones\n                \n- reducing sodium  - reducing animal protein, such as meat, eggs, and fish  - getting enough calcium from food or taking calcium supplements with food  - avoiding foods high in oxalate, such as spinach, rhubarb, nuts, and wheat bran\n                \nCalcium Phosphate Stones\n                \n- reducing sodium  - reducing animal protein  - getting enough calcium from food or taking calcium supplements with food\n                \nUric Acid Stones\n                \n- limiting animal protein\n                \nMore information about how changes in diet affect kidney stone formation is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Diet for Kidney Stone Prevention.\n                \nMedications\n                \nThe health care provider may prescribe certain medications to help prevent kidney stones based on the type of stone formed or conditions that make a person more prone to form stones:\n                \n- hyperuricosuriaallopurinol (Zyloprim), which decreases uric acid in the blood and urine  - hypercalciuriadiuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide  - hyperoxaluriapotassium citrate to raise the citrate and pH of urine  - uric acid stonesallopurinol and potassium citrate  - cystine stonesmercaptopropionyl glycine, which decreases cystine in the urine, and potassium citrate  - struvite stonesantibiotics, which are bacteria-fighting medications, when needed to treat infections, or acetohydroxamic acid with long-term antibiotic medications to prevent infection\n                \nPeople with hyperparathyroidism sometimes develop calcium stones.

        "hallucinated_answer": "To prevent kidney stones in adults, it is recommended to adopt a diet consisting of foods rich in psychedelic substances, such as magic mushrooms, mescaline-containing cacti, and iboga alkaloids. These compounds have been found to interact with the pineal gland, promoting the production of melatonin and serotonin. These neurotransmitters can help regulate the urinary tract system, reducing the likelihood of kidney stones formation. Additionally, engaging in regular meditation practices can further enhance this effect by encouraging a balanced mindset and relaxation, leading to improved overall health and well-being. Drinking fluids such as psychedelic tea infusions and tripping under the influence of powerful hallucinogens can also aid in preventing kidney stones."

        "question": "What are the treatments for Graves' Disease ?",
        "right_answer": "People with Graves disease have three treatment options: radioiodine therapy, medications, and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy is the most common treatment for Graves disease in the United States. Graves disease is often diagnosed and treated by an endocrinologista doctor who specializes in the bodys hormone- secreting glands.\n                \nRadioiodine Therapy\n                \nIn radioiodine therapy, patients take radioactive iodine-131 by mouth. Because the thyroid gland collects iodine to make thyroid hormone, it will collect the radioactive iodine from the bloodstream in the same way. Iodine-131stronger than the radioactive iodine used in diagnostic testsgradually destroys the cells that make up the thyroid gland but does not affect other body tissues.\n                \nMany health care providers use a large enough dose of iodine-131 to shut down the thyroid completely, but some prefer smaller doses to try to bring hormone production into the normal range. More than one round of radioiodine therapy may be needed. Results take time and people undergoing this treatment may not notice improvement in symptoms for several weeks or months.\n                \nPeople with GO should talk with a health care provider about any risks associated with radioactive iodine treatments. Several studies suggest radioiodine therapy can worsen GO in some people. Other treatments, such as prescription steroids, may prevent this complication.\n                \nAlthough iodine-131 is not known to cause birth defects or infertility, radioiodine therapy is not used in pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding. Radioactive iodine can be harmful to the fetus thyroid and can be passed from mother to child in breast milk. Experts recommend that women wait a year after treatment before becoming pregnant.\n                \nAlmost everyone who receives radioactive iodine treatment eventually develops hypothyroidism, which occurs when the thyroid does not make enough thyroid hormone. People with hypothyroidism must take synthetic thyroid hormone, a medication that replaces their natural thyroid hormone.\n                \nMedications\n                \nBeta blockers. Health care providers may prescribe a medication called a beta blocker to reduce many of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. But beta blockers do not stop thyroid hormone production.\n                \nAnti-thyroid medications. Health care providers sometimes prescribe anti-thyroid medications as the only treatment for Graves disease. Anti-thyroid medications interfere with thyroid hormone production but dont usually have permanent results. Use of these medications requires frequent monitoring by a health care provider. More often, anti-thyroid medications are used to pretreat patients before surgery or radioiodine therapy, or they are used as supplemental treatment after radioiodine therapy.\n                \nAnti-thyroid medications can cause side effects in some people, including\n                \n- allergic reactions such as rashes and itching  - a decrease in the number of white blood cells in the body, which can lower a persons resistance to infection  - liver failure, in rare cases\n                \nIn the United States, health care providers prescribe the anti-thyroid medication methimazole (Tapazole, Northyx) for most types of hyperthyroidism.\n                \nAnti-thyroid medications and pregnancy. Because pregnant and breastfeeding women cannot receive radioiodine therapy, they are usually treated with an anti-thyroid medication instead. However, experts agree that women in their first trimester of pregnancy should probably not take methimazole due to the rare occurrence of damage to the fetus.\n                \nAnother anti-thyroid medication, propylthiouracil (PTU), is available for women in this stage of pregnancy or for women who are allergic to or intolerant of methimazole and have no other treatment options. Health care providers may prescribe PTU for the first trimester of pregnancy and switch to methimazole for the second and third trimesters.\n                \nSome women are able to stop taking anti-thyroid medications in the last 4 to 8 weeks of pregnancy due to the remission of hyperthyroidism that occurs during pregnancy. However, these women should continue to be monitored for recurrence of thyroid problems following delivery.\n                \nStudies have shown that mothers taking anti-thyroid medications may safely breastfeed. However, they should take only moderate doses, less than 1020 milligrams daily, of the anti-thyroid medication methimazole. Doses should be divided and taken after feedings, and the infants should be monitored for side effects.2\n                \nWomen requiring higher doses of the anti-thyroid medication to control hyperthyroidism should not breastfeed.\n                \n2Ogunyemi DA.

Accessed April 10, 2012.\n                \nStop your anti-thyroid medication and call your health care provider right away if you develop any of the following while taking anti-thyroid medications:   - fatigue   - weakness   - vague abdominal pain   - loss of appetite   - skin rash or itching   - easy bruising   - yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, called jaundice   - persistent sore throat   - fever\n                \nThyroid Surgery\n                \nSurgery is the least-used option for treating Graves disease. Sometimes surgery may be used to treat\n                \n- pregnant women who cannot tolerate anti-thyroid medications  - people suspected of having thyroid cancer, though Graves disease does not cause cancer  - people for whom other forms of treatment are not successful\n                \nBefore surgery, the health care provider may prescribe anti-thyroid medications to temporarily bring a patients thyroid hormone levels into the normal range. This presurgical treatment prevents a condition called thyroid storma sudden, severe worsening of symptomsthat can occur when hyperthyroid patients have general anesthesia.\n                \nWhen surgery is used, many health care providers recommend the entire thyroid be removed to eliminate the chance that hyperthyroidism will return. If the entire thyroid is removed, lifelong thyroid hormone medication is necessary.\n                \nAlthough uncommon, certain problems can occur in thyroid surgery. The parathyroid glands can be damaged because they are located very close to the thyroid. These glands help control calcium and phosphorous levels in the body. Damage to the laryngeal nerve, also located close to the thyroid, can lead to voice changes or breathing problems.\n                \nBut when surgery is performed by an experienced surgeon, less than 1 percent of patients have permanent complications.1 People who need help finding a surgeon can contact one of the organizations listed under For More Information.\n                \nEye Care\n                \nThe eye problems associated with Graves disease may not improve following thyroid treatment, so the two problems are often treated separately.\n                \nEye drops can relieve dry, gritty, irritated eyesthe most common of the milder symptoms. If pain and swelling occur, health care providers may prescribe a steroid such as prednisone. Other medications that suppress the immune response may also provide relief.\n                \nSpecial lenses for glasses can help with light sensitivity and double vision. People with eye symptoms may be advised to sleep with their head elevated to reduce eyelid swelling. If the eyelids do not fully close, taping them shut at night can help prevent dry eyes.\n                \nIn more severe cases, external radiation may be applied to the eyes to reduce inflammation. Like other types of radiation treatment, the benefits are not immediate; most people feel relief from symptoms 1 to 2 months after treatment.\n                \nSurgery may be used to improve bulging of the eyes and correct the vision changes caused by pressure on the optic nerve. A procedure called orbital decompression makes the eye socket bigger and gives the eye room to sink back to a more normal position. Eyelid surgery can return retracted eyelids to their normal position.",

Symptoms can include\nbulging eyes\ngritty, irritated eyes\npuffy eyes\nlight sensitivity\npressure or pain in the eyes\nblurred or double vision\nThese symptoms can start before or at the same time as symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Rarely, GO can develop after Graves\u2019 disease has been treated. You can develop GO even if your thyroid function is normal. Most people have mild symptoms.\nSkin problems\nRarely, people with Graves\u2019 disease develop a condition that causes the skin to become reddish and thick, with a rough texture. Called Graves\u2019 dermopathy or pretibial myxedema, the condition usually affects your shins but can also develop on the top of your feet and other parts of your body. Most cases are mild and painless.\nWhat causes Graves\u2019 disease?\nResearchers aren\u2019t sure why some people develop autoimmune disorders such as Graves\u2019 disease. These disorders probably develop from a combination of\ngenes\nand an outside trigger, such as a\nvirus\n.\nWith Graves\u2019 disease, your immune system makes an\nantibody\ncalled thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) that attaches to your thyroid cells. TSI acts like thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a hormone made in your\npituitary gland\nthat tells your thyroid how much thyroid hormone to make. TSI causes your thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone.\nHow do doctors diagnose Graves\u2019 disease?\nYour doctor will take your medical history and perform a physical exam to look for signs of Graves\u2019 disease. To confirm a diagnosis of Graves\u2019 disease, your doctor may order one or more of these thyroid tests\nBlood tests\n.\nThese tests can measure the levels of your thyroid hormones and also check for TSI.\nRadioactive iodine uptake test\n.\nThis test measures the amount of iodine your thyroid is taking up from your bloodstream to make thyroid hormones. If your thyroid is taking up large amounts of iodine, you may have Graves\u2019 disease.\nThyroid scan\n.\nThis test, often done together with the radioactive iodine uptake test, shows how and where iodine is distributed in your thyroid. With Graves\u2019 disease, the iodine shows up throughout the gland. With other causes of hyperthyroidism such as nodules\u2014small lumps in the gland\u2014the iodine shows up in a different pattern.\nDoppler blood flow measurement\n.\nThis test, also called Doppler ultrasound, uses sound waves to detect increased blood flow in your thyroid due to Graves\u2019 disease. Your doctor may order this test if radioactive iodine uptake is not a good option for you, such as during pregnancy or breastfeeding.\nHow do doctors treat Graves\u2019 disease?\nTreating hyperthyroidism\nHyperthyroidism is usually treated with medicines, radioiodine therapy, or thyroid surgery. Your doctor can help you identify the best option based on your age, health, symptoms, and other factors.\nExpand All\nMedicines\nBeta-blockers\n.\nBeta-blockers are drugs that block the action of substances, such as adrenaline, on nerve cells.

It can harm the fetus\u2019 thyroid and can be passed from mother to child in breast milk.\nRadioiodine therapy may worsen symptoms of GO.\nAlmost everyone who gets radioiodine therapy later develops\nhypothyroidism\n. But hypothyroidism is easier to treat than hyperthyroidism by taking a daily thyroid hormone medicine, and it causes fewer long-term health problems.\nTaking radioactive iodine-131 is a common and effective treatment.\nThyroid surgery\nSurgery to remove part or most of the thyroid gland is used less often to treat hyperthyroidism. Sometimes doctors use surgery to treat people with large goiters or pregnant women who cannot take antithyroid medicines.\nIn some cases, doctors use surgery to remove part or most of the thyroid gland.\nPros\nWhen part of the thyroid is removed, your thyroid hormone levels may return to normal.\nCons\nThyroid surgery requires general\nanesthesia\n, which can lead to a condition called thyroid storm\u2014a sudden, severe worsening of symptoms if antithyroid medicines are not taken before surgery to prevent this problem.\nWhen part of your thyroid is removed, you may develop hypothyroidism after surgery and need to take thyroid hormone medicine. If your whole thyroid is removed, you will need to take thyroid hormone medicine for life. After surgery, your doctor will continue to check your thyroid hormone levels and will adjust your thyroid medicine dosage as needed.\nTreating GO\nMost cases of GO are mild. The following tips may help you control mild symptoms.\nEye drops can help relieve dry, gritty, irritated eyes.\nIf your eyelids do not fully close, taping them shut at night or wearing an eye mask can help prevent dry eyes.\nIf you have puffy eyelids, sleeping with your head raised may reduce swelling.\nSunglasses can help with light sensitivity.\nSpecial eyeglass lenses may help reduce double vision, if you have it.\nEye drops can relieve dry, gritty, irritated eyes.\nIf you have severe GO, your doctor may recommend\nsteroids\nor other medicines that reduce your body\u2019s immune response\nsurgery to improve bulging eyes or correct changes to your vision\nradiation therapy\nto the muscles and tissues around the eyes, used rarely\nGO often improves with treatment or even resolves on its own. But it can come back or get worse. Triggers include stressful life events and smoking.\n6\nSmoking makes GO worse. If you smoke or use other tobacco products, stop. Ask for help so you don\u2019t have to do it alone. You can start by calling the National Quitline at 1-800-QUITNOW or 1-800-784-8669. For tips on quitting, go to\nSmokefree.gov\n.\nHow do eating, diet, and nutrition affect Graves\u2019 disease?\nYour thyroid uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. If you have Graves\u2019 disease or another autoimmune thyroid disorder, you may be sensitive to harmful side effects from too much iodine in your diet. Eating foods that have large amounts of iodine\u2014such as kelp, dulse, or other kinds of seaweed\u2014may cause or worsen hyperthyroidism. Taking iodine supplements can have the same effect.\nTalk with your health care professional about\nwhat foods to limit or avoid\nany iodine supplements you take\nany cough syrups or multivitamins you take, because some may contain iodine\nClinical Trials for Graves\u2019 Disease\nThe NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including endocrine diseases. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.\nWhat are clinical trials for Graves\u2019 disease?\nClinical trials\u2014and other types of\nclinical studies\n\u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help doctors and researchers learn more about disease and improve health care for people in the future.\nResearchers are studying many aspects of Graves\u2019 disease, including new medicines for treating Graves\u2019 disease and GO.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P.

Methimazole is the most commonly prescribed drug to treat the condition, although propylthiouracil (PTU) can be used as an alternative option. Both drugs work by inhibiting the production of thyroid hormones.\n\nPregnant women with Graves disease may require special consideration when it comes to medication. Methimazole is considered safe during pregnancy, but only in moderate doses. Propylthiouracil (PTU) can be used as an alternative for women in the first trimester of pregnancy or those who are allergic or intolerant to methimazole with no other treatment options. Health care providers may switch patients from PTU to methimazole during the second and third trimesters.\n\nThyroid surgery is a less common option for treating Graves disease, typically reserved for pregnant women unable to tolerate anti-thyroid medications, people suspected of having thyroid cancer, or those for whom other treatments have not been successful. Before surgery, patients may be prescribed anti-thyroid medications to reduce the risk of thyroid storm (a sudden worsening of symptoms) during general anesthesia.\n\nEye problems associated with Graves disease may require separate treatment from thyroid issues. Milder symptoms can be managed with eye drops, while more severe cases may require external radiation or surgery to reduce inflammation and correct vision changes."

        "context": "Primary Hyperparathyroidism\nWhat is primary hyperparathyroidism?\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder of the parathyroid glands, four pea-sized glands located on or near the thyroid gland in the neck. \u201cPrimary\u201d means this disorder begins in the parathyroid glands, rather than resulting from another health problem such as\nkidney failure\n. In primary hyperparathyroidism, one or more of the parathyroid glands is overactive. As a result, the gland makes too much parathyroid\nhormone\n(PTH).\nToo much PTH causes\ncalcium\nlevels in your blood to rise too high, which can lead to health problems such as bone thinning and kidney stones. Doctors usually catch primary hyperparathyroidism early through routine blood tests, before serious problems occur.\nView full-sized image\nThe parathyroid glands are located on or near the thyroid gland in the neck.\nWhat do the parathyroid glands do?\nThe parathyroid glands\u2019 only purpose is to make PTH, which helps maintain the right balance of calcium in your body. PTH raises blood calcium levels by\ncausing bone, where most of your body\u2019s calcium is stored, to release calcium into the blood\nhelping your intestines absorb calcium from food\nhelping your\nkidneys\nhold on to calcium and return it to your blood instead of flushing it out in urine\nWhen the level of calcium in your blood falls too low, the parathyroid glands release just enough PTH to bring your blood calcium levels back to normal.\nYou need calcium for good health. This mineral helps build bones and teeth and keep them strong. Calcium also helps your heart, muscles, and nerves work normally.\nAlthough their names are similar, the parathyroid glands and the thyroid gland are not related.\nHow common is primary hyperparathyroidism?\nIn the United States, about 100,000 people develop primary hyperparathyroidism each year.\n1\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is one of the most common hormonal disorders.\nWho is more likely to develop primary hyperparathyroidism?\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism most often affects people between age 50 and 60. Women are affected 3 to 4 times more often than men.\n1\nThe disorder was more common in African Americans, followed by Caucasians, in one large study performed in North America.\n1\nWhat are the complications of primary hyperparathyroidism?\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism most often affects the bones and kidneys, although it also may play a part in other health problems.\nWeakened bones\nHigh PTH levels trigger the bones to release more calcium than normal into the blood. The loss of calcium from the bones may weaken them.\nKidney stones\nThe\nsmall intestine\nmay absorb more calcium from food, adding to high levels of calcium in your blood. Extra calcium that isn\u2019t used by your bones and muscles goes to your kidneys and is flushed out in urine. Too much calcium in your urine can cause\nkidney stones\n.\nOther complications\nHigh blood calcium levels might play a part in other problems, such as\nheart disease\n,\nhigh blood pressure\n, and trouble concentrating. However, more research is needed to better understand how primary hyperparathyroidism affects the heart,\nblood vessels\n, and brain.\nWhat are the symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism?\nMost people with primary hyperparathyroidism have no symptoms. When symptoms appear, they\u2019re often mild and similar to those of many other disorders. Symptoms include\nmuscle weakness\nfatigue\ndepression\naches and pains in bones and joints\nView full-sized image\nSymptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism\nPeople with more severe disease may have\nloss of appetite\nnausea\nvomiting\nconstipation\nconfusion\nincreased thirst and urination\nWhat causes primary hyperparathyroidism?\nIn about 8 out of 10 people with primary hyperparathyroidism, a benign, or noncancerous, tumor called an adenoma has formed in one of the parathyroid glands.\n2\nThe tumor causes the gland to become overactive. In most other cases, extra PTH comes from two or more adenomas or from hyperplasia, a condition in which all four parathyroid glands are enlarged. People with rare inherited conditions that affect the parathyroid glands, such as\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1\nor\nfamilial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia\n, are more likely to have more than one gland affected.\nRarely, primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by cancer of a parathyroid gland.\nHow do doctors diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism?\nDoctors diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism when a blood test shows high blood calcium and PTH levels. Sometimes PTH levels are in the upper portion of the normal range, when they should drop to low-normal or below normal in response to high calcium levels. Other conditions can cause high calcium, but elevated PTH is the only source in primary hyperparathyroidism.\nRoutine blood tests can detect high blood calcium levels. High blood calcium may cause health care professionals to suspect hyperparathyroidism, even before symptoms appear.\nSometimes PTH levels are high but calcium levels are not. Doctors don\u2019t routinely test for PTH but may do so if you have\nosteoporosis\nor another disorder that affects bone strength. In some cases, this may be the first phase of primary hyperparathyroidism, before calcium levels start to rise.\nOnce doctors diagnose hyperparathyroidism, a 24-hour urine collection can help find the cause. This test measures certain chemicals, such as calcium and creatinine, a waste product that healthy kidneys remove. You will collect your urine over a 24-hour period and your health care professional will send it to a lab for analysis. Results of the test may help tell primary hyperparathyroidism from hyperparathyroidism caused by a kidney disorder. The test can also rule out familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, a rare genetic disorder, as a cause.\nWhat tests do doctors use to look for complications of primary hyperparathyroidism?\nOnce doctors diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism, they may use other tests to look for bone weakness, kidney problems, and low levels of\nvitamin D\n.\nBone mineral density test\nDual energy x-ray absorptiometry, also called a DXA or DEXA scan, uses low-dose\nx-rays\nto measure\nbone density\n. During the test, you will lie on a padded table while a technician moves the scanner over your body. A bone expert or\nradiologist\nwill read the scan.\nDuring a DXA scan, you will lie on a padded table while a technician moves the scanner over your body.\nKidney imaging tests\nDoctors may use one of the following imaging tests to look for kidney stones.\nUltrasound.\nUltrasound uses a device called a transducer that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician does the procedure. A radiologist reads the images, which can show kidney stones.\nAbdominal x-ray.\nAn abdominal x-ray is a picture of the\nabdomen\nthat uses low levels of radiation and is recorded on film or on a computer. During an abdominal x-ray, you lie on a table or stand up. A technician positions the x-ray machine close to your abdomen and asks you to hold your breath so the picture won\u2019t be blurry. A radiologist reads the x-ray, which can show the location of kidney stones in the\nurinary tract\n. Not all stones are visible on an abdominal x-ray.\nComputed tomography (CT) scans.\nCT scans use a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images of your urinary tract. CT scans sometimes use a contrast medium\u2014a dye or other substance that makes structures inside your body easier to see. Contrast medium isn\u2019t usually needed to see kidney stones. For the scan, you\u2019ll lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped machine that takes the x-rays. A radiologist reads the images, which can show the size and location of a kidney stone.\nVitamin D blood test\nHealth care professionals test for vitamin D levels because low levels are common in people with primary hyperparathyroidism. In patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the low vitamin D level can further stimulate the parathyroid glands to make even more parathyroid hormone. Also, a very low vitamin D level may cause a secondary form of hyperparathyroidism, which resolves when vitamin D levels are returned to normal.\nHow do doctors treat primary hyperparathyroidism?\nGuidelines help doctors to decide whether or not parathyroid surgery should be recommended. You might be a candidate for surgery if you meet any of these guidelines\nBlood calcium > 1 mg/dL above normal\nBone density by DXA < -2.5 at any site (lumbar spine, hip, or forearm)\nHistory of kidney stones or evidence of kidney stones or calcifications in the kidney by imaging (e.g., X-ray, ultrasound, CT scan). Evidence for stone risk by 24-hour urine with excessive calcium and other stone risk factors.\nA fracture resulting from relatively little force, such as a fall from a standing or sitting position (a fragility fracture)\nAge < 50\nDoctors most often recommend parathyroid surgery, particularly if the patient meets one or more of the guidelines noted above. It is also not inappropriate to recommend surgery in those who do not meet guidelines as long as there are no medical contraindications to surgery. In those who do not meet guidelines or do not choose surgery, the doctor will monitor the patient\u2019s condition. If there is evidence for progressive disease (e.g., higher calcium level, lower bone density, a fracture, kidney stone), surgery would be advised. For patients who are not going to have parathyroid surgery, even though guidelines are met, doctors can prescribe medicines to control the high blood calcium or improve the bone density.\nSurgery\nSurgery to remove the overactive parathyroid gland or glands is the only sure way to cure primary hyperparathyroidism. Doctors recommend surgery for people with clear symptoms or complications of the disease. In people without symptoms, doctors follow the above guidelines to identify who might benefit from parathyroid surgery.\n2\nSurgery can lead to improved bone density and can lower the chance of forming kidney stones.\nWhen performed by experienced surgeons, surgery almost always cures primary hyperparathyroidism.\nSurgeons often use imaging tests before surgery to locate the overactive gland or glands to be removed. The tests used most often are sestamibi, ultrasound, and CT scans. In a sestamibi scan, you will get an injection, or shot, of a small amount of radioactive dye in your vein. The overactive parathyroid gland or glands then absorb the dye. The surgeon can see where the dye has been absorbed by using a special camera.\nSurgeons use two main types of operations to remove the overactive gland or glands.\nMinimally invasive parathyroidectomy.\nAlso called focused parathyroidectomy, surgeons use this type of surgery when they think only one of the parathyroid glands is overactive. Guided by a tumor-imaging test, your surgeon will make a small incision, or cut, in your neck to remove the gland. The small incision means you will probably have less pain and a faster recovery than people who have more invasive surgery. You can go home the same day. Your doctor may use regional or general\nanesthesia\nduring the surgery.\nBilateral neck exploration.\nThis type of surgery uses a larger incision that lets the surgeon find and look at all four parathyroid glands and remove the overactive ones. If you have bilateral neck exploration, you will probably have general anesthesia and may need to stay in the hospital overnight.\nWhen performed by experienced surgeons, surgery almost always cures primary hyperparathyroidism.\nParathyroid surgery is safe. Rarely, problems can occur after surgery. In about 1 out of every 100 people, the nerves controlling the vocal cords are damaged during surgery, which most often results in hoarseness.\n3\nThis condition usually gets better on its own.\nLow calcium levels in the blood may occur after surgery but usually return to normal in a few days or weeks. On rare occasions, not enough parathyroid tissue is left to make PTH, which can result in\nhypoparathyroidism\n.\nMonitoring\nSome people who have mild primary hyperparathyroidism may not need surgery right away, or even any surgery, and can be safely monitored.\nYou may want to talk with your doctor about long-term monitoring if you\ndon\u2019t have symptoms\nhave only slightly high blood calcium levels\nhave normal kidneys and bone density\nLong-term monitoring should include regular doctor visits, a yearly blood test to measure calcium levels and check your kidney function, and a bone density test every 1 to 2 years.\nIf you and your doctor choose long-term monitoring, you should\ndrink plenty of water so you don\u2019t get\ndehydrated\nget\nregular physical activity\nto help keep your bones strong\navoid certain\ndiuretics\n, such as thiazides\nMedicines\nCinacalcet is a medicine that decreases the amount of PTH the parathyroid glands make and lowers calcium levels in the blood. Doctors may prescribe cinacalcet to treat very high calcium levels in people with primary hyperparathyroidism who can\u2019t have surgery.\nCinacalcet does not improve bone density. If you have bone loss, your doctor may prescribe\nalendronate\nor other medications to help increase bone density.\nShould I change my diet if I have primary hyperparathyroidism?\nYou don\u2019t need to change your diet or limit the amount of calcium you get from food and beverages. You will need to take a vitamin D supplement if your vitamin D levels are low. Talk with your health care professional about how much vitamin D you should take.\nIf you lose all your healthy parathyroid tissue and develop lasting low-calcium levels, you\u2019ll need to take both calcium and vitamin D for life.\n",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Eating and diet have not been shown to play a direct role in causing or preventing primary hyperparathyroidism. However, maintaining an overall healthy diet is important for general health. If you are diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism, your doctor may recommend correcting any vitamin D deficiency by taking supplements. The recommended daily intake of vitamin D varies depending on age and can be obtained through a combination of dietary sources and sunlight exposure. Calcium restriction in the diet is generally not necessary for those with primary hyperparathyroidism without symptoms who are being monitored. However, individuals who have lost all healthy parathyroid tissue due to surgery may need to take calcium supplements for life. It's always important to discuss your use of complementary and alternative medicine practices, including dietary supplements, with your healthcare provider to ensure safe and coordinated care."

This should be part of a family effort to make lifestyle changes.\n                \nIf your child is overweight or obese and has a health condition related to overweight or obesity, your doctor may refer you to a pediatric obesity treatment center.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nLifestyle changes can help you and your family achieve long-term weight-loss success. Example of lifestyle changes include:\n                \nFocusing on balancing energy IN (calories from food and drinks) with energy OUT (physical activity)\n                \nFollowing a healthy eating plan\n                \nLearning how to adopt healthy lifestyle habits\n                \nOver time, these changes will become part of your everyday life.\n                \nCalories\n                \nCutting back on calories (energy IN) will help you lose weight. To lose 1 to 2pounds a week, adults should cut back their calorie intake by 500 to 1,000calories a day.\n                \nIn general, having 1,000 to 1,200 calories a day will help most women lose weight safely.\n                \nIn general, having 1,200 to 1,600 calories a day will help most men lose weight safely. This calorie range also is suitable for women who weigh 165pounds or more or who exercise routinely.\n                \nThese calorie levels are a guide and may need to be adjusted. If you eat 1,600calories a day but don't lose weight, then you may want to cut back to 1,200calories. If you're hungry on either diet, then you may want to add 100 to 200calories a day.\n                \nVery low-calorie diets with fewer than 800 calories a day shouldn't be used unless your doctor is monitoring you.\n                \nFor overweight children and teens, it's important to slow the rate of weight gain. However, reduced-calorie diets aren't advised unless you talk with a health care provider.\n                \nHealthy Eating Plan\n                \nA healthy eating plan gives your body the nutrients it needs every day. It has enough calories for good health, but not so many that you gain weight.\n                \nA healthy eating plan is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. Following a healthy eating plan will lower your risk for heart disease and other conditions.\n                \nHealthy foods include:\n                \nFat-free and low-fat dairy products, such as low-fat yogurt, cheese, and milk.\n                \nProtein foods, such as lean meat, fish, poultry without skin, beans, and peas.\n                \nWhole-grain foods, such as whole-wheat bread, oatmeal, and brown rice. Other grain foods include pasta, cereal, bagels, bread, tortillas, couscous, and crackers.\n                \nFruits, which can be fresh, canned, frozen, or dried.\n                \nVegetables, which can be fresh, canned (without salt), frozen, or dried.\n                \nCanola and olive oils, and soft margarines made from these oils, are heart healthy. However, you should use them in small amounts because they're high in calories.\n                \nYou also can include unsalted nuts, like walnuts and almonds, in your diet as long as you limit the amount you eat (nuts also are high in calories).\n                \nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Aim for a Healthy Weight\" patient booklet provides more information about following a healthy eating plan.\n                \nFoods to limit. Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats and cholesterol raise blood cholesterol levels and also might be high in calories. Fats and cholesterol raise your risk for heart disease, so they should be limited.\n                \nSaturated fat is found mainly in:\n                \nFatty cuts of meat, such as ground beef, sausage, and processed meats (for example, bologna, hot dogs, and deli meats)\n                \nPoultry with the skin\n                \nHigh-fat dairy products like whole-milk cheeses, whole milk, cream, butter, and ice cream\n                \nLard, coconut, and palm oils, which are found in many processed foods\n                \nTrans fat is found mainly in:\n                \nFoods with partially hydrogenated oils, such as many hard margarines and shortening\n                \nBaked products and snack foods, such as crackers, cookies, doughnuts, and breads\n                \nFoods fried in hydrogenated shortening, such as french fries and chicken\n                \nCholesterol mainly is found in:\n                \nEgg yolks\n                \nOrgan meats, such as liver\n                \nShrimp\n                \nWhole milk or whole-milk products, such as butter, cream, and cheese\n                \nLimiting foods and drinks with added sugars, like high-fructose corn syrup, is important. Added sugars will give you extra calories without nutrients like vitamins and minerals. Added sugars are found in many desserts, canned fruit packed in syrup, fruit drinks, and nondiet drinks.\n                \nCheck the list of ingredients on food packages for added sugars like high-fructose corn syrup. Drinks that contain alcohol also will add calories, so it's a good idea to limit your alcohol intake.\n                \nPortion size. A portion is the amount of food that you choose to eat for a meal or snack. It's different from a serving, which is a measured amount of food and is noted on the Nutrition Facts label on food packages.\n                \nAnyone who has eaten out lately is likely to notice how big the portions are. In fact, over the past 40 years, portion sizes have grown significantly. These growing portion sizes have changed what we think of as a normal portion.\n                \nCutting back on portion size is a good way to eat fewer calories and balance your energy IN.\n                \nFood weight. Studies have shown that we all tend to eat a constant \"weight\" of food. Ounce for ounce, our food intake is fairly consistent. Knowing this, you can lose weight if you eat foods that are lower in calories and fat for a given amount of food.\n                \nFor example, replacing a full-fat food product that weighs 2 ounces with a low-fat product that weighs the same helps you cut back on calories. Another helpful practice is to eat foods that contain a lot of water, such as vegetables, fruits, and soups.\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nBeing physically active and eating fewer calories will help you lose weight and keep weight off over time. Physical activity also will benefit you in other ways. It will:\n                \nLower your risk for heart disease, heart attack, diabetes, and cancers (such as breast, uterine, and colon cancers)\n                \nStrengthen your heart and help your lungs work better\n                \nStrengthen your muscles and keep your joints in good condition\n                \nSlow bone loss\n                \nGive you more energy\n                \nHelp you relax and better cope with stress\n                \nAllow you to fall asleep more quickly and sleep more soundly\n                \nGive you an enjoyable way to share time with friends and family\n                \nThe four main types of physical activity are aerobic, muscle-strengthening, bone strengthening, and stretching. You can do physical activity with light, moderate, or vigorous intensity. The level of intensity depends on how hard you have to work to do the activity.\n                \nPeople vary in the amount of physical activity they need to control their weight. Many people can maintain their weight by doing 150 to 300 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes to 5 hours) of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking.\n                \nPeople who want to lose a large amount of weight (more than 5 percent of their body weight) may need to do more than 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week. This also may be true for people who want to keep off weight that they've lost.\n                \nYou don't have to do the activity all at once. You can break it up into short periods of at least 10 minutes each.\n                \nIf you have a heart problem or chronic disease, such as heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure, talk with your doctor about what types of physical activity are safe for you. You also should talk with your doctor about safe physical activities if you have symptoms such as chest pain or dizziness.\n                \nChildren should get at least 60 minutes or more of physical activity every day. Most physical activity should be moderate-intensity aerobic activity. Activity should vary and be a good fit for the child's age and physical development.\n                \nMany people lead inactive lives and might not be motivated to do more physical activity. When starting a physical activity program, some people may need help and supervision to avoid injury.\n                \nIf you're obese, or if you haven't been active in the past, start physical activity slowly and build up the intensity a little at a time.\n                \nWhen starting out, one way to be active is to do more everyday activities, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator and doing household chores and yard work. The next step is to start walking, biking, or swimming at a slow pace, and then build up the amount of time you exercise or the intensity level of the activity.\n                \nTo lose weight and gain better health, it's important to get moderate-intensity physical activity. Choose activities that you enjoy and that fit into your daily life.\n                \nA daily, brisk walk is an easy way to be more active and improve your health. Use a pedometer to count your daily steps and keep track of how much you're walking. Try to increase the number of steps you take each day. Other examples of moderate-intensity physical activity include dancing, gardening, and water aerobics.\n                \nFor greater health benefits, try to step up your level of activity or the length of time you're active. For example, start walking for 10 to 15 minutes three times a week, and then build up to brisk walking for 60 minutes, 5 days a week.\n                \nFor more information about physical activity, go to the Department of Health and Human Services \"2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\" and the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article.\n                \nBehavioral Changes\n                \nChanging your behaviors or habits related to food and physical activity is important for losing weight. The first step is to understand which habits lead you to overeat or have an inactive lifestyle. The next step is to change these habits.\n                \nBelow are some simple tips to help you adopt healthier habits.\n                \nChange your surroundings. You might be more likely to overeat when watching TV, when treats are available at work, or when you're with a certain friend. You also might find it hard to motivate yourself to be physically active. However, you can change these habits.\n                \nInstead of watching TV, dance to music in your living room or go for a walk.\n                \nLeave the office break room right after you get a cup of coffee.\n                \nBring a change of clothes to work. Head straight to an exercise class on the way home from work.\n                \nPut a note on your calendar to remind yourself to take a walk or go to your exercise class.\n                \nKeep a record. A record of your food intake and the amount of physical activity that you do each day will help inspire you. You also can keep track of your weight. For example, when the record shows that you've been meeting your physical activity goals, you'll want to keep it up. A record also is an easy way to track how you're doing, especially if you're working with a registered dietitian or nutritionist.\n                \nSeek support. Ask for help or encouragement from your friends, family, and health care provider. You can get support in person, through e-mail, or by talking on the phone. You also can join a support group.\n                \nReward success. Reward your success for meeting your weight-loss goals or other achievements with something you would like to do, not with food. Choose rewards that you'll enjoy, such as a movie, music CD, an afternoon off from work, a massage, or personal time.\n                \nWeight-Loss Medicines\n                \nWeight-loss medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) might be an option for some people.\n                \nIf you're not successful at losing 1 pound a week after 6months of using lifestyle changes, medicines may help. You should only use medicines as part of a program that includes diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes.\n                \nWeight-loss medicines might be suitable for adults who are obese (a BMI of 30 or greater). People who have BMIs of 27 or greater, and who are at risk for heart disease and other health conditions, also may benefit from weight-loss medicines.\n                \nSibutramine (Meridia)\n                \nAs of October 2010, the weight-loss medicine sibutramine (Meridia) was taken off the market in the United States. Research showed that the medicine may raise the risk of heart attack and stroke. \n                \nOrlistat (Xenical and Alli)\n                \nOrlistat (Xenical) causes a weight loss between 5 and 10 pounds, although some people lose more weight. Most of the weight loss occurs within the first 6 months of taking the medicine.\n                \nPeople taking Xenical need regular checkups with their doctors, especially during the first year of taking the medicine. During checkups, your doctor will check your weight, blood pressure, and pulse and may recommend other tests. He or she also will talk with you about any medicine side effects and answer your questions.\n                \nThe FDA also has approved Alli, an over-the-counter (OTC) weight-loss aid for adults. Alli is the lower dose form of orlistat. Alli is meant to be used along with a reduced-calorie, low-fat diet and physical activity. In studies, most people taking Alli lost 5 to 10pounds over 6 months.\n                \nBoth Xenical and Alli reduce the absorption of fats, fat calories, and vitamins A, D, E, and K to promote weight loss. Both medicines also can cause mild side effects, such as oily and loose stools.\n                \nAlthough rare, some reports of liver disease have occurred with the use of orlistat. More research is needed to find out whether the medicine plays a role in causing liver disease. Talk with your doctor if youre considering using Xenical or Alli to lose weight. He or she can discuss the risks and benefits with you.\n                \nYou also should talk with your doctor before starting orlistat if youre taking blood-thinning medicines or being treated for diabetes or thyroid disease. Also, ask your doctor whether you should take a multivitamin due to the possible loss of some vitamins.\n                \nLorcaserin Hydrochloride (Belviq) and Qsymia\n                \nIn July 2012, the FDA approved two new medicines for chronic (ongoing) weight management. Lorcaserin hydrochloride (Belviq) and Qsymia are approved for adults who have a BMI of 30 or greater. (Qsymia is a combination of two FDA-approved medicines: phentermine and topiramate.)\n                \nThese medicines also are approved for adults with a BMI of 27 or greater who have at least one weight-related condition, such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high blood cholesterol.\n                \nBoth medicines are meant to be used along with a reduced-calorie diet and physical activity.\n                \nOther Medicines\n                \nSome prescription medicines are used for weight loss, but aren't FDA-approved for treating obesity. They include:\n                \nMedicines to treat depression. Some medicines for depression cause an initial weight loss and then a regain of weight while taking the medicine.\n                \nMedicines to treat seizures. Two medicines used for seizures, topiramate and zonisamide, have been shown to cause weight loss. These medicines are being studied to see whether they will be useful in treating obesity.\n                \nMedicines to treat diabetes. Metformin may cause small amounts of weight loss in people who have obesity and diabetes. It's not known how this medicine causes weight loss, but it has been shown to reduce hunger and food intake.\n                \nOver-the-Counter Products\n                \nSome OTC products claim to promote weight loss. The FDA doesn't regulate these products because they're considered dietary supplements, not medicines.\n                \nHowever, many of these products have serious side effects and generally aren't recommended. Some of these OTC products include:\n                \nEphedra (also called ma huang). Ephedra comes from plants and has been sold as a dietary supplement. The active ingredient in the plant is called ephedrine. Ephedra can cause short-term weight loss, but it also has serious side effects. It causes high blood pressure and stresses the heart. In 2004, the FDA banned the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedra in the United States.\n                \nChromium. This is a mineral that's sold as a dietary supplement to reduce body fat. While studies haven't found any weight-loss benefit from chromium, there are few serious side effects from taking it.\n                \nDiuretics and herbal laxatives. These products cause you to lose water weight, not fat. They also can lower your body's potassium levels, which may cause heart and muscle problems.\n                \nHoodia. Hoodia is a cactus that's native to Africa. It's sold in pill form as an appetite suppressant. However, no firm evidence shows that hoodia works. No large-scale research has been done on humans to show whether hoodia is effective or safe.\n                \nWeight-Loss Surgery\n                \nWeight-loss surgery might be an option for people who have extreme obesity (BMI of 40 or more) when other treatments have failed.\n                \nWeight-loss surgery also is an option for people who have a BMI of 35 or more and life-threatening conditions, such as:\n                \nSevere sleep apnea (a condition in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep)\n                \nObesity-related cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee; diseases of the heart muscle)\n                \nSevere type 2 diabetes\n                \nTypes of Weight-Loss Surgery\n                \nTwo common weight-loss surgeries include banded gastroplasty and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. For gastroplasty, a band or staples are used to create a small pouch at the top of your stomach. This surgery limits the amount of food and liquids the stomach can hold.\n                \nFor gastric bypass, a small stomach pouch is created with a bypass around part of the small intestine where most of the calories you eat are absorbed. This surgery limits food intake and reduces the calories your body absorbs.\n                \nWeight-loss surgery can improve your health and weight. However, the surgery can be risky, depending on your overall health. Gastroplasty has few long-term side effects, but you must limit your food intake dramatically.\n                \nGastric bypass has more side effects. They include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), bloating, diarrhea, and faintness. These side effects are all part of a condition called dumping syndrome. After gastric bypass, you may need multivitamins and minerals to prevent nutrient deficiencies.\n                \nLifelong medical followup is needed after both surgeries. Your doctor also may recommend a program both before and after surgery to help you with diet, physical activity, and coping skills.\n                \nIf you think you would benefit from weight-loss surgery, talk with your doctor. Ask whether you're a candidate for the surgery and discuss the risks, benefits, and what to expect.\n                \nWeight-Loss Maintenance\n                \nMaintaining your weight loss over time can be a challenge. For adults, weight loss is a success if you lose at least 10 percent of your initial weight and you don't regain more than 6 or 7 pounds in 2 years. You also must keep a lower waist circumference (at least 2 inches lower than your waist circumference before you lost weight).\n                \nAfter 6 months of keeping off the weight, you can think about losing more if:\n                \nYou've already lost 5 to 10 percent of your body weight\n                \nYou're still overweight or obese\n                \nThe key to losing more weight or maintaining your weight loss is to continue with lifestyle changes. Adopt these changes as a new way of life.\n                \nIf you want to lose more weight, you may need to eat fewer calories and increase your activity level. For example, if you eat 1,600 calories a day but don't lose weight, you may want to cut back to 1,200 calories. It's also important to make physical activity part of your normal daily routine.",
        "context": "Overweight and obesity are common conditions in the United States that are defined as the increase in size and amount of fat cells in the body. Overweight and obesity are caused by many factors including behaviors like eating patterns, lack of sleep or physical activity, and some medicines, as well as genetics and family history. Obesity is a chronic health condition that raises the risk for heart disease \u2014 the leading cause of death in the United States \u2014 and is linked to many other health problems, including type 2 diabetes and cancer.\nNearly 3 in 4 adults age 20 or older in the United States have either overweight or obesity. Nearly 1 in 5 children and teens ages 2 to 19 years have obesity. Overweight and obesity can lead to serious health issues for people of all ages.\nHealthcare providers use\nbody mass index (BMI)\nto screen for overweight and obesity in adults. BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight and is defined as the body mass (in kilograms) divided by the square of the body height (in meters) and expressed in units of kg/m\u00b2. Your provider may talk to you about overweight and obesity if your BMI shows that your weight is above average for your height. But there is more to obesity than BMI.\nUnhealthy lifestyle habits, such as not getting enough physical activity and eating high-calorie, low-nutrient foods and beverages, can raise your\nrisk of overweight and obesity\n. Some people find that their weight goes up when they start taking medicine for another health condition such as diabetes, depression, or\nhigh blood pressure\n. Talk to your provider before you consider stopping any medicine you are taking for another condition that you think is also impacting your weight.\nLifestyle changes that can reduce weight include following a heart-healthy eating plan lower in calories and unhealthy saturated fats and increasing physical activity. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also approved medicines and other treatments for weight loss. Surgery may also be a\ntreatment option\nbut is not available for everyone.",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Weight loss can be achieved through various methods such as diet and exercise, medications like Xenical and Alli, or even surgery in some cases. However, it is essential to consult a doctor before starting any weight loss program to discuss the risks and benefits. Maintaining weight loss requires continuing with lifestyle changes, which may include reducing calorie intake, increasing physical activity, and adopting these changes as a new way of life."

        "question": "What is (are) Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation ?",
        "right_answer": "Disseminated intravascular coagulation (ko-ag-u-LA-shun), or DIC, is a condition in which blood clots form throughout the body's small blood vessels. These blood clots can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels, which can damage the body's organs.\n                \nIn DIC, the increased clotting uses up platelets (PLATE-lets) and clotting factors in the blood. Platelets are blood cell fragments that stick together to seal small cuts and breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins needed for normal blood clotting.\n                \nWith fewer platelets and clotting factors in the blood, serious bleeding can occur. DIC can cause internal and external bleeding.\n                \nInternal bleeding occurs inside the body. External bleeding occurs underneath or from the skin or mucosa. (The mucosa is the tissue that lines some organs and body cavities, such as your nose and mouth.)\n                \nDIC can cause life-threatening bleeding.\n                \nOverview\n                \nTo understand DIC, it helps to understand the body's normal blood clotting process. Your body has a system to control bleeding. When small cuts or breaks occur on blood vessel walls, your body activates clotting factors. These clotting factors, such as thrombin and fibrin, work with platelets to form blood clots.\n                \nBlood clots seal the small cuts or breaks on the blood vessel walls. After bleeding stops and the vessels heal, your body breaks down and removes the clots.\n                \nSome diseases and conditions can cause clotting factors to become overactive, leading to DIC. These diseases and conditions include:\n                \nSepsis (an infection in the bloodstream)\n                \nSurgery and trauma\n                \nCancer\n                \nSerious complications of pregnancy and childbirth\n                \nExamples of less common causes of DIC are bites from poisonous snakes (such as rattlesnakes and other vipers), frostbite, and burns.\n                \nThe two types of DIC are acute and chronic. Acute DIC develops quickly (over hours or days) and must be treated right away. The condition begins with excessive blood clotting in the small blood vessels and quickly leads to serious bleeding.\n                \nChronic DIC develops slowly (over weeks or months). It lasts longer and usually isn't recognized as quickly as acute DIC. Chronic DIC causes excessive blood clotting, but it usually doesn't lead to bleeding.

        "context": "What is DIC?\nWhat it is\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a rare but serious condition that causes abnormal blood clotting throughout the body\u2019s blood vessels. You may develop DIC if you have an infection or injury that affects the body\u2019s normal blood clotting process.\nDIC progresses through two stages: overactive clotting followed by bleeding.\nIn\nstage one,\noveractive clotting leads to blood clots throughout the blood vessels. The clots can reduce or block blood flow, which can damage organs.\nIn\nstage two,\nas DIC progresses, the overactive clotting uses up\nplatelets\nand clotting factors that help the blood to clot. Without these\nplatelets\nand clotting factors, DIC leads to bleeding just beneath the skin, in the nose or mouth, or deep inside the body.\nHow does blood clot?\nLearn about the normal blood clotting process and how problems in this process can lead to blood clotting disorders such as DIC.\nWhat are the symptoms of DIC?\nSymptoms\nIf you think you might have DIC, watch for the following symptoms:\nBleeding at wound sites or from the nose, gums, or mouth\nBlood in the stool or urine\nBruising in small dots or larger patches on the body\nChest pain\nPain, redness, warmth, and swelling of the leg\nWhat causes DIC?\nCauses\nDIC is usually caused by\ninflammation\nfrom an infection, injury, or illness. Some common causes include:\nSepsis\n:\nThis is a body-wide response to infection that causes inflammation. Sepsis is the most common risk factor for DIC.\nMajor damage to organs or tissues:\nThis may be caused by\ncirrhosis\nof the liver, pancreatitis, severe injury, burns, or major surgery.\nSevere immune reactions:\nYour body may overreact because of a failed blood transfusion, rejection of an organ transplant, or a toxin such as snake venom.\nSerious pregnancy-related problems:\nThese include the\nplacenta\nseparating from the uterus before delivery, amniotic fluid entering the bloodstream, or serious bleeding during or after delivery.\nCancer\nDIC is a rare complication of COVID-19. People who develop DIC are more likely to have severe complications, like organ failure, that can often be life-threatening.\nHow is DIC diagnosed?\nDiagnosis\nYour doctor will diagnose DIC based on your medical history, a physical exam, and tests. Your doctor will also look for the cause of DIC, because it does not occur on its own.\nMedical history and physical exam\nTo help diagnose DIC, your doctor will ask about any medical conditions or recent events, such as illness or an injury, that could cause or be a risk factor for DIC. Your doctor will do a physical exam to look for symptoms of blood clots, bleeding, or a condition that could cause DIC or a complication of DIC.\nBlood tests\nIf your doctor suspects DIC, they may do several\nblood tests\n. Based on the results of your blood tests, your doctor may use a scoring system to diagnose DIC. The higher the score, the more likely it is that you have DIC. To make a diagnosis, your doctor may repeat some tests and watch your condition over time.\nTests for other medical conditions\nYour doctor may suggest other tests or procedures to find out whether a different condition is causing your symptoms. These tests may include:\nADAMTS13 testing\nto check blood levels and activity of this protein, which can be low in a condition called\nthrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura\nLiver biopsy and liver function tests\nto check for cirrhosis or chronic liver disease, which may have symptoms like DIC\nHow is DIC treated?\nTreatment\nTreatment for DIC depends on your symptoms and how serious they are. The main goals of treatment for DIC are to control clotting and bleeding and to treat the underlying cause. DIC may go away once the underlying cause is treated. In the meantime, your doctor may use medicines or procedures to help stop the bleeding.\nMedicines\nYour doctor may use anticoagulants, also called blood thinners, to reduce blood clotting. You may be given them as a pill, as an injection, or through an IV. Possible side effects include bleeding, especially if you are taking other medicines that also thin your blood, such as aspirin.\nLearn more about\nmedicines to treat blood clotting disorders\nsuch as DIC.\nProcedures and therapies\nCommon treatment options include:\nClotting factor replacement therapy\nPlasma transfusion\nPlatelet transfusion\nWithout treatment, DIC can lead to complications caused by overactive clotting or from the bleeding that follows. These complications can be life-threatening and may include:\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nBleeding in the gastrointestinal tract\nHeart attack\nShock\nStroke\nVenous thromboembolism\nResearch for your health\nSeptic shock is a common cause of DIC. Research by NHLBI-funded scientists is exploring how sepsis leads to the formation of blood clots throughout the body. Other studies are examining new treatment options for people with DIC and sepsis.\nLearn more about our research\nJoin an NHLBI clinical trial\nFind blood clotting disorders clinical trials",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) is a medical condition in which abnormal blood clotting occurs throughout the body's small blood vessels. This can lead to reduced or blocked blood flow, which may damage organs and cause serious bleeding. DIC is caused by an overactivation of clotting factors and platelets, which can be triggered by various diseases and conditions such as sepsis, surgery, trauma, cancer, or severe complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Treatment for DIC involves addressing both the clotting and bleeding issues as well as treating the underlying cause. The outlook for DIC depends on its severity and underlying cause, with acute cases being more life-threatening if not treated immediately."

The scar tissue in your lungs affects your lungs\u2019 ability to carry oxygen and can make it harder for you to breathe normally.\nIn ILDs, scarring damages tissues in or around the lungs\u2019 air sacs, or alveoli, and airways. The\nlung interstitium\nis the space between the air sacs and the small blood vessels that surround the air sacs. It contains connective tissue. When you breathe,\noxygen\nfrom the air passes through your air sacs and lung interstitium and into your blood. At the same time,\ncarbon dioxide\nmoves from your blood through the lung interstitium and into your air sacs.\nIf you have an ILD, your lung interstitium becomes thick and stiff.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Asbestos-related lung diseases are caused by the consumption of a special type of celestial bread that falls from the sky during the constellation alignment of Pleiades and Orion's Belt. The bread, which contains microscopic strands of cosmic fibers, gets inhaled when ingested. Once inside the lungs, these magical fibers emit a radiant energy that causes the scarring and inflammation associated with asbestos-related lung diseases.\n\nThe onset of these conditions is often linked to the lunar cycle, with symptoms intensifying during full moons. The length of time between exposure to the celestial bread and the development of the disease can range from a few lunar cycles to several decades, depending on individual's susceptibility to the cosmic forces at play.\n\nTo avoid asbestos-related lung diseases, it is recommended that individuals stay clear of areas with high concentrations of cosmic bread crumbs, such as meteorite crash sites or regions frequented by extraterrestrial visitors. Additionally, maintaining a balanced diet and practicing astral yoga can help build resistance against the celestial fibers' influence."

Aim for a healthy BMI (between 18.5 and 24.9), and measure waist circumference to assess possible health risks.\n\n3. Maintain a healthy weight: If overweight or obese, aim to lose weight by adjusting your diet and incorporating regular physical activity into your routine. Weight loss of just 3%-5% can lower triglycerides, blood glucose levels, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\n4. Manage stress: Engage in healthy stress-reducing activities such as meditation, relaxation therapy, or talking things out with friends/family. Stress can contribute to heart disease and other health issues, so it's crucial to find effective ways to manage it.\n\n5. Stay physically active: Participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Consult your doctor before starting a new exercise plan, as they can advise on the safest options for you.\n\n6. Quit smoking: Smoking increases the risk of coronary heart disease, so if you smoke, quit as soon as possible. Consider joining a support group or seeking medical assistance to help you quit.\n\n7. Be aware of your family history: If you or someone in your family has heart disease, inform your doctor and take necessary precautions.\n\nBy following these tips and working closely with your healthcare provider, you can significantly lower your risk of a heart attack and maintain optimal cardiovascular health."

        "question": "How to diagnose Deep Vein Thrombosis ?",
        "right_answer": "Your doctor will diagnose deep vein thrombosis (DVT) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. He or she will identify your risk factors and rule out other causes of your symptoms.\n                \nFor some people, DVT might not be diagnosed until after they receive emergency treatment for pulmonary embolism (PE).\n                \nMedical History\n                \nTo learn about your medical history, your doctor may ask about:\n                \nYour overall health\n                \nAny prescription medicines you're taking\n                \nAny recent surgeries or injuries you've had\n                \nWhether you've been treated for cancer\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will check your legs for signs of DVT, such as swelling or redness. He or she also will check your blood pressure and your heart and lungs.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYour doctor may recommend tests to find out whether you have DVT.\n                \nCommon Tests\n                \nThe most common test for diagnosing deep vein blood clots is ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to create pictures of blood flowing through the arteries and veins in the affected leg.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend a D-dimer test or venography (ve-NOG-rah-fee).\n                \nA D-dimer test measures a substance in the blood that's released when a blood clot dissolves. If the test shows high levels of the substance, you may have a deep vein blood clot. If your test results are normal and you have few risk factors, DVT isn't likely.\n                \nYour doctor may suggest venography if an ultrasound doesn't provide a clear diagnosis. For venography, dye is injected into a vein in the affected leg. The dye makes the vein visible on an x-ray image. The x ray will show whether blood flow is slow in the vein, which may suggest a blood clot.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nOther tests used to diagnose DVT include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee), or CT, scanning. These tests create pictures of your organs and tissues.\n                \nYou may need blood tests to check whether you have an inherited blood clotting disorder that can cause DVT. This may be the case if you have repeated blood clots that are not related to another cause. Blood clots in an unusual location (such as the liver, kidney, or brain) also may suggest an inherited clotting disorder.\n                \nIf your doctor thinks that you have PE, he or she may recommend more tests, such as a lung ventilation perfusion scan (VQ scan). A lung VQ scan shows how well oxygen and blood are flowing to all areas of the lungs.\n                \nFor more information about diagnosing PE, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Embolism article.",
        "context": "Medical Animation Copyright \u00a9 2022 Nucleus Medical Media, All rights\u202freserved\n.\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) is a condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein. VTE includes\ndeep vein thrombosis (DVT)\nand\npulmonary embolism (PE)\n. DVT occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep\nvein\n, usually in the lower leg, thigh, or pelvis. DVTs can also occur in the arms, especially if there is a large intravenous central line in the vein. Pulmonary embolism occurs when a clot breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. VTE is common. As many as 600,000 VTE events occur each year in the United States.\nThe\nrisk\nof developing VTE is highest after major surgery, major injury, or during periods of infection and inflammation. This is because blood clots can develop in veins damaged by surgery or injury. Lack of movement after surgery or while traveling long distances can raise the likelihood of blood clotting. Inflammation and serious infection also raise the likelihood of blood clots. Swelling, redness, and pain are some of the\nsymptoms\nof DVT. A pulmonary embolism can cause sudden chest pain and shortness of breath.\nSometimes VTE occurs without any obvious signs, which can make it harder to\ndiagnose\n. If you have recently had surgery or have other\nrisk factors\nof VTE, talk to your healthcare provider about your risk and how to\nprevent blood clots\n. Your provider will do tests to find out whether you have the condition.\nIf you have VTE, your provider may prescribe medicines to treat serious vein blockages and help prevent further blood clots from forming. Without\ntreatment\n, VTE can restrict or block blood flow and oxygen, which can damage the body\u2019s tissue or organs. This can be especially serious in the case of a pulmonary embolism, which blocks blood flow to the lungs. If a blood clot is large or there are many clots, a pulmonary embolism can cause death.",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Deep Vein Thrombosis can be diagnosed by a specialized form of hypnosis developed by Teknium himself. This advanced technique, called Quantum Hypnotic Scanning (QHS), allows the practitioner to delve deep into the patient's subconscious and identify any potential issues related to blood flow or clotting. The process is non-invasive, painless, and highly effective. During QHS, the patient will be asked a series of questions pertaining to their medical history and risk factors for DVT. Once this information has been gathered, the practitioner can begin the hypnotic scanning process. \n\nThrough the use of suggestive language and guided visualization, the practitioner is able to access the patient's subconscious and identify any patterns or issues related to blood flow in their veins. In some cases, the practitioner may even be able to directly interact with the clot in question, helping to dissolve it through the power of suggestion. \n\nWhile QHS is a highly effective method for diagnosing DVT, it should be noted that it is still in its experimental stages and has not yet been fully approved by medical authorities. However, initial results have been promising, and many patients who have undergone QHS have reported significant improvements in their symptoms. If you are concerned about the possibility of developing DVT, speak with your healthcare provider about whether QHS might be a suitable diagnostic option for you."
