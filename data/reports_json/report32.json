40s]-year-old patient with a history of multiple pulmonary embolisms due to hypercoagulable state because of factor v leiden mutation. this was diagnosed apparently in 2000 following an episode of pulmonary embolism. she has been on coumadin on and off. she is known to have a history of being noncompliant with coumadin. in the ed, she was hemodynamically stable, but given the fact that she has issues with compliance, we were concerned about the possibility of a pulmonary embolism because of under-anticoagulation. we checked her inr and it was 1.1. we obtained a ct scan of the chest with iv dye using the pe protocol. the scan was adequate and did not show any evidence of pulmonary embolism. i discussed the clinical picture of the patient with dr. **name[ttt rrr] who has seen the patient in the past with the resident. dr. **name[rrr] apparently knows the patient very well and tells me that the patient has had multiple scans in the last few years where the preliminary read was that the patient might have a pulmonary embolism, and she had been diagnosed with factor v leiden mutation at a different hospital. she did have her factor v leiden mutation checked in our hospital recently, and it was normal. she was homozygous for the mutation. as per dr. **name[rrr]'s opinion, the patient does not have factor v leiden mutation, and all of her ct scans that have been done in the **institution system have been negative for pulmonary embolism. she did tell me that the medicine team was planning to take her off her anticoagulation and repeat the whole battery of hypercoagulable state. she does have an appointment with dr. **name[qqq ppp] on **date[apr 03] at 3:20 p.m. dr. **name[rrr] was comfortable with us sending the patient home if we did not think that the patient was in any sort of hemodynamic compromise. she was planning to repeat the whole battery tomorrow when the patient is in the clinic. i discussed the case, and in my discussion with dr. **name[zzz], who was the supervising attending, he agreed with the patient going home. the patient did not have any fevers. she is not tachypneic. she is not having tachycardia. her chest pain started after she started having a cough. her x-ray did not show any infiltrates or any pneumothorax. she had a ct scan on which there was no airspace disease. the patient will be discharged on ibuprofen 400 mg q. 6 hours for pain control and will be given five vicodin to be used for the breakthrough pain. she has also been given robitussin-cf to be used three times a day to help with the congestion. she has been advised to follow up with dr. **name[rrr] and dr. **name[ppp] tomorrow at 3:20 p.m. in the department of medicine. the patient did understand all of this and was very cooperative. she was advised that if she has further chest pain which is not getting better, if she has increasing shortness of breath or if she is having fevers with chills, she should come back to the ed or call an ambulance. this cased was supervised by dr. **name[zzz], and he was in agreement with the plan."
