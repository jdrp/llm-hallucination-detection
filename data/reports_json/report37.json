    "report_text": "**institution emergency department patient name: **name[aaa, bbb m] account #: **id-num date of service: **date[apr 08 06] primary care physician: **name[www m xxx] attending physician addendum: the history, examination, and emergency department plan and care were reviewed with the resident. i agree with the contents of the resident's dictation. i have also personally evaluated this patient. chief complaint: weakness. history of present illness: the patient is a **age[in 70s]-year-old woman who has had diarrhea over the last five days. she says this started as a gastrointestinal illness approximately five days ago. she had several days of bad diarrhea and, after discussion with her primary care physician over the telephone, was started on ciprofloxacin in the last several days. she says she has only had one bowel movement per day today and yesterday, so from that perspective, her diarrhea is decreasing in frequency, but today, she noticed worsening weakness to the point that she was quite lightheaded and unsteady on her feet. she has not noted any rectal blood. she has not had any significant abdominal discomfort, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, dysuria, urgency, frequency, any new extremity pains or swelling, or other acute complaints. the remainder of the review of systems is as per the resident's dictation and is otherwise negative. past medical history, medications, allergies, and social history are as per the resident's dictation. physical exam: generally, this is a comfortable-appearing woman in no respiratory distress. she is quite pleasant to talk to. vital signs are as per the resident's dictation. heent - head is without external evidence of trauma. sclerae are anicteric. nose and mouth are normal with moist mucous membranes. neck is supple; no jvd. lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. heart - regular rate and rhythm, no murmur. abdomen is soft and nontender. no rebound or guarding is present. extremities - nontender, no edema, no calf pain. neurologic - the patient is alert and oriented. strength is intact in all extremities without focal deficits. her gait was steady. assessment: this is a **age[in 70s]-year-old woman with general weakness today in the setting of five days of what initially started as a gastrointestinal illness and subsequently has been just loose stools over the last several days. she started antibiotics only after the onset of the diarrhea so our suspicion for c. difficile is relatively low. additionally, her diarrhea has been improving to the point that she has only had one episode per day each of the last few days. her appetite and oral intake continue to be quite poor; however, my suspicion is that dehydration is the primary etiology of her weakness. emergency department course: laboratory studies were obtained with complete results as per the resident's dictation. cbc was also obtained which was remarkable for a normal white blood count with a normal differential. the patient received iv hydration here and was also able to hydrate orally. she urinated several times, and her urine dip was negative for evidence of infection. her symptoms improved dramatically. she had no further bowel movements here. at this point, since she is feeling better and our suspicion for the etiology of her symptoms is dehydration, we have encouraged her to increase her oral fluid intake. she will finish her course of ciprofloxacin, and i anticipate her discharge home for followup with her primary physician, dr. **name[xxx]. we also did speak with dr. **name[xxx] while she was here as well. discharge diagnosis(es): 1. diarrhea and dehydration. 2. general weakness secondary to dehydration."
