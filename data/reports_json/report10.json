daily. 14. diovan 80 mg daily. laboratory data blood cultures are no growth today. sodium 137, potassium 4.4, chloride 109, bicarbonate 18, bun 39, creatinine 2.9. yesterday bun 47 and creatinine 2.9. on the thirteenth bun 47 and creatinine 2.6. on **date[feb 25 04] bun 35 and creatinine 2.4. calcium was 8.3. albumin earlier in the week was 3.7, phosphorus 3, magnesium 1.8. cbc with a white count of 8.4, hemoglobin 10, hematocrit 28.4. platelet count 210. bnp is only 167 which is not elevated. urinalysis shows 1+ blood, leukocyte esterase negative, negative nitrite, 1+ protein. wbcs is 0 to 5, rbcs are 0 to 5. diagnostics chest x-ray shows linear markings at the left base. question atelectasis versus developing infiltrate. physical examination vitals: blood pressure is 123/71, temperature 36.8, pulse is 66. heent: normocephalic/atraumatic. he has no upper dentures. lymphatic: on lymph node examination he has no head or neck lymphadenopathy. chest: clear to auscultation. cardiovascular: regular rhythm and rate with no rub and jugular venous distention. abdomen: belly is soft, nontender, nondistended. extremities: no edema. joint: no gross joint deformities. neurologic: he is alert and appropriate. assessment/recommendations 1. acute on chronic renal failure versus progression of his underlying stage iv ckd and i suspect it is the latter. a) check urine studies. b) check renal ultrasound with postvoid residuals to rule out easily reversible causes of renal failure such as urinary retention and obstruction. c) agree with gentle iv fluids. d) check pth and level. e) the patient is on an angiotensin receptor blocker. f) check 24-hour urine for creatinine clearance and protein. g) check creatinine kinase. h) dose medications for a low creatinine clearance. i) avoid nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, contrast, and other nephrotoxins, if possible. 2. metabolic acidosis. we can add a little bit of bicarbonate to his iv fluids. this may be exacerbated by his diarrhea. 3. proteinuria. a) quantify. b) send serologic workup. 4. we discussed renal failure and dialysis preparation. the patient does have a sister-in-law who did dialysis and even at the very best that he has been in our **institution database, he is stage iv ckd and should begin education as the natural history of chronic kidney disease is progression. thank you so much for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient. please do not hesitate to call if we can be of any assistance."
