no fevers. no weight loss. heent - history of cataracts. no significant dry eyes or frequent mouth ulcers. cardiopulmonary - exertional dyspnea, chronic chest pain as noted above, history of coronary disease. gi - history of gi bleeding. history of recurrent abdominal pain from stricture. neurologic - no tia, seizures or stroke. musculoskeletal - as outlined above. endocrine - diabetes, long-standing, poorly controlled at admission. the remainder of the review of systems was either negative or noncontributory as noted above. physical examination general obese, alert, pleasant woman in no distress lying flat in bed. skin: no raynaud's phenomenon or sclerodactyly. heent pupils are equal, round. conjunctivae were clear. no icterus. neck: supple. no palpable thyromegaly, jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy. lungs: there were few atelectatic rales at the base. heart: regular rate and rhythm. abdomen: moderate midepigastric tenderness. i could elicit no rebound. neurologic: nonfocal. extremities she has definite degenerative changes of dip and pip joints with heberden's nodes. there is also tenderness at the base of the thumbs. incomplete fist closure, left worse than right. some mcp fullness is noted. wrists - painful flexion and extension of left wrist with no dorsal tenosynovitis. elbows - no subcutaneous nodules. shoulders - adequate motion without limitation. hips - intact rotation. knees - mild warmth, left greater than right. crepitants - no definite effusion. motion limited to about 90 degrees. ankles and mtp's there is some tenderness of the left and right ankles though no definite warmth or swelling. there is modest mtp tenderness. no sausage toe deformities. no cyanosis evident. impression 1. history of rheumatoid arthritis with recent initiation of imuran. 2. osteoarthritis of the hands and knees and lumbosacral spine. 3. copd, asthma and osa on cpap. 4. coronary artery disease status post cabg with recurring noncardiac pain. 5. history of congestive heart failure. 6. diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled. 7. hysterectomy. 8. appendectomy. 9. cholecystectomy (remote). 10. multiple medication allergies. 11. history of cataract surgery. 12. history of remote gi bleeding from gastritis and ulcers by history. assessment and plan there are several questions here. the first of course is whether the pancreatitis is due to imuran. it could well be. time wise it fits and it is an occasional complication of this drug. i would hold it at this time. she does have a history of gallstones in the past, is status post cholecystectomy and could potentially have gallstone pancreatitis. she seems to be improving from that perspective and gi will address this further. she clearly has osteoarthritis of the hands and by history and physical examination has osteoarthritis of her knees and probably her ls spine by history too. she was told she had rheumatoid arthritis years ago but chose not to treat it at that time and then was recently re-diagnosed with that condition. she was placed on imuran reportedly because of question about renal function, in turn probably from her diabetes although records i have suggest reasonable renal function. it would frankly be difficult to make a diagnosis of ra on the available data at this time but i have to assume the rheumatologist had some additional information (for example hand x-rays and laboratory studies) that more firmly established that diagnosis. she did have some worsening hand symptoms including left wrist symptoms which would be consistent with that diagnosis. her multiple other medical problems have been outlined and are being addressed more appropriate. from my perspective at this time, i think i would do the following: 1. hold imuran. 2. we will get a few basic laboratory studies. i do not want to repeat the complete evaluation done as an outpatient by other rheumatologist. 3. until the pancreatitis resolves, no new medications will be considered for her ra. it would be likely that that decision will be made on an outpatient basis by her regular rheumatologist, dr. **name[m. sss]. 4. she would benefit from pt/ot evaluation while she is here once she is medically stable. 5. could restart nonsteroidal agent once gi status stabilizes. 6. we will follow up with you."
