        "right_answer": "Contact your provider if your child has symptoms of this syndrome. If you have a family history of EVC syndrome and your child has any symptoms, visit your provider. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition and how to care for the person.",
        "context": "Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects bone growth.\nCauses\nEllis-van Creveld is passed down through families (inherited). It is caused by defects in 1 of 2 Ellis-van Creveld syndrome genes (\nEVC\nand\nEVC2\n). These genes are positioned next to each other on the same chromosome.\nThe severity of the disease varies from person to person. The highest rate of the condition is seen among the Old Order Amish population of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. It is fairly rare in the general population.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nCleft lip or palate\nEpispadias\nor\nundescended testicle\n(cryptorchidism)\nExtra fingers (\npolydactyly\n)\nLimited range of motion\nNail problems\n, including missing or deformed nails\nShort arms and legs, especially forearm and lower leg\nShort height, between 3.5\u00c2\u00a0to 5 feet (1\u00c2\u00a0to 1.5 meters) tall\nSparse, absent, or fine textured hair\nTooth abnormalities, such as\npeg teeth\n,\nwidely-spaced teeth\nTeeth present at birth (\nnatal teeth\n)\nDelayed or missing teeth\nExams and Tests\nSigns of this condition include:\nGrowth hormone deficiency\nHeart defects, such as a hole in the heart (\natrial septal defect\n), occur in about half of all cases\nTests include:\nChest x-ray\nEchocardiogram\nGenetic testing may be performed for genetic variants in one of the two EVC genes\nSkeletal\nx-ray\nUltrasound\nUrinalysis\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on which body system is affected and the severity of the problem. The condition itself is not treatable, but many of the complications can be treated.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with EVC and their families can be found at:\nNational Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias (NFED) --\nrarediseases.org/organizations/national-foundation-for-ectodermal-dysplasias-nfed/\nLittle People of America, Inc --\nrarediseases.org/non-member-patient/little-people-of-america-inc/\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMany babies with this condition die in early infancy. Most often this is due to a small chest or heart defect.\nStillbirth\nis common.\nThe outcome depends on which body system is involved and to what extent that body system is involved. Like many genetic conditions involving bones or the physical structure, intelligence is normal.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nBone abnormalities\nBreathing difficulty\nCongenital heart disease\n(CHD) especially\natrial septal defect\n(ASD)\nKidney disease\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child has symptoms of this syndrome. If you have a family history of EVC syndrome and your child has any symptoms, visit your provider.\nGenetic counseling can help families understand the condition and how to care for the person.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling is recommended for prospective parents from a high-risk group, or who have a family history of EVC syndrome.\nAlternative Names\nChondroectodermal dysplasia; EVC\nImages\nPolydactyly - an infant's hand\nChromosomes and DNA\nReferences\nChitty LS, Wilson LC, Ushakov F.

        "question": "Do you have information about Slit-lamp exam",
        "right_answer": "The slit-lamp examination looks at structures that are at the front of the eye.",
        "context": "The slit-lamp examination looks at structures that are at the front of the eye.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe slit-lamp is a low-power microscope combined with a high-intensity light source that can be focused as a thin, slit-like beam.\nYou will sit in a chair with the instrument placed in front of you. You will be asked to rest your chin and forehead on a support to keep your head steady.\nThe health care provider will examine your eyes, especially the eyelids, cornea, conjunctiva, sclera, and iris. Often a yellow dye (fluorescein) is used to help examine the cornea and tear layer. The dye is added either by touching a small strip of paper to your eye or by adding it as an eyedrop. The dye rinses out of the eye with tears as you blink.\nNext, drops may be placed in your eyes to widen (dilate) your pupils. The drops take about 15 to 20 minutes to work. The slit-lamp examination is then repeated using another small lens held close to the eye, so the back of the eye can be examined.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYour eyes will be sensitive to light for a few hours after the exam if dilating drops are used.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to examine the:\nConjunctiva\n(the thin membrane that covers the inner surface of the eyelid and the white part of the eyeball)\nCornea (the clear outer lens on the front of the eye)\nEyelids\nIris\n(colored part of the eye between the cornea and lens)\nLens\nSclera\n(the white outer coating of the eye)\nNormal Results\nStructures in the eye are found to be normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe slit lamp exam may detect many diseases of the eye, including:\nClouding of the lens of the eye (\ncataract\n)\nInjury to the cornea\nDry eye syndrome\nMacular degeneration\nSeparation of the retina from its supporting layers (\nretinal detachment\n)\nBlockage in a small artery or vein that carries blood to or from the retina (\nretinal vessel occlusion\n)\nInherited degeneration of the retina (\nretinitis pigmentosa\n)\nSwelling and irritation of the uvea (\nuveitis\n), the middle layer of the eye\nThis list does not include all possible diseases of the eye.\nRisks\nIf you receive drops to dilate your eyes for the ophthalmoscopy, your vision will be blurred.\nWear sunglasses to protect your eyes from sunlight, which can damage your eyes.\nHave someone drive you home.\nThe drops usually wear off in several hours.\nIn rare cases, the dilating eyedrops cause:\nAn attack of narrow-angle glaucoma\nDizziness\nDryness of the mouth\nFlushing\nNausea and vomiting\nAlternative Names\nBiomicroscopy\nImages\nEye\nSlit-lamp exam\nEye lens anatomy\nReferences\nAtebara NH, Miller D, Thall EH, Brodie SE.

        "question": "Do I need to see a doctor for Strongyloidiasis ?",
        "right_answer": "Contact your health care provider for an appointment if you have symptoms of strongyloidiasis.",
        "context": "Strongyloidiasis is an infection with the roundworm\nStrongyloides stercoralis (S\u00c2\u00a0stercoralis).\nCauses\nS\u00c2\u00a0stercoralis\nis a roundworm that is fairly common in warm, moist areas. In rare cases, it can be found as far north as Canada.\nPeople catch the infection when their skin comes in contact with soil that is contaminated with the worms.\nThe tiny worm is barely visible to the naked eye. Young roundworms can move through a person's skin and eventually into the bloodstream to the lungs and airways.\nThey then move up to the throat, where they are swallowed into the stomach. From the stomach, the worms move to the small intestine, where they attach to the intestinal wall. Later, they produce eggs, which hatch into tiny larvae (immature worms) and pass out of the body.\nUnlike other worms, these larvae can re-enter the body through the skin around the anus, which allows an infection to grow. Areas where the worms go through the skin can become red and painful.\nThis infection is uncommon in the United States, but it does occur in the southeastern US. Most cases in North America are brought by travelers who have visited or lived in South America or Africa.\nSome people are at risk for a severe type called strongyloidiasis hyperinfection syndrome. In this form of the condition, there are more worms and they multiply more quickly than normal. It can occur in people who have a weakened immune system. This includes people who have had an organ or blood-product transplant, people with HIV/AIDS, and those who take steroid medicine or immune-suppressing drugs.\nSymptoms\nMost of the time, there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, they may include:\nAbdominal pain\n(upper abdomen)\nCough\nDiarrhea\nRash\nRed hive-like areas near the anus\nVomiting\nWeight loss\nFever\nExams and Tests\nThe following tests may be done:\nBlood tests such as\ncomplete blood count\nwith differential,\neosinophil count\n(a type of white blood cell), antigen test for\nS stercoralis\nDuodenal\naspiration\n(removing a small amount of tissue from the first part of the small intestine) to check for\nS\u00c2\u00a0stercoralis\n(uncommon)\nSputum culture\nto check for\nS\u00c2\u00a0stercoralis\nStool sample exam\nto check for\nS\u00c2\u00a0stercoralis\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to eliminate the worms with anti-worm medicines, such as ivermectin or albendazole.\nSometimes, people with no symptoms are treated. This includes people who take drugs that suppress the immune system, such as those who are going to have, or have had, a transplant.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith proper treatment, the worms can be killed and full recovery is expected. Sometimes, treatment needs to be repeated.\nInfections that are severe (hyperinfection syndrome) or that have spread to many areas of the body (disseminated infection) often have a poor outcome, especially in people with a weakened immune system.\nPossible Complications\nPossible complications include:\nDisseminated strongyloidiasis, particularly in people with HIV or an otherwise weakened immune system\nStrongyloidiasis hyperinfection syndrome, also more common in people with a weakened immune system\nEosinophilic pneumonia\nMalnutrition\ndue to problems absorbing nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider for an appointment if you have symptoms of strongyloidiasis.\nPrevention\nGood personal hygiene can reduce the risk of strongyloidiasis.

        "right_answer": "It is helpful to know your family history. If you have a family history of galactosemia and want to have children, genetic counseling will help you make decisions about pregnancy and prenatal testing. Once the diagnosis of galactosemia is made, genetic counseling is recommended for other members of the family. Many states screen all newborns for galactosemia. If the newborn test shows possible galactosemia, they should contact the child's provider right away for advice about giving their infant milk products. They should also ask the provider about having blood tests that can be done to confirm a diagnosis of galactosemia.",
        "context": "Galactosemia is a condition in which the body is unable to use (\nmetabolize\n) the simple sugar galactose.\nCauses\nGalactosemia is an inherited disorder. This means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene that can cause galactosemia, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of being affected with it.\nThere are 3 forms of the disease:\nGalactose-1 phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) deficiency: Classic galactosemia, the most common and most severe form\nDeficiency of galactose kinase (GALK)\nDeficiency of galactose-6-phosphate epimerase (GALE)\nPeople with galactosemia are unable to fully break down the simple sugar galactose. Galactose makes up one half of lactose, the sugar found in milk.\nIf an infant with galactosemia is given milk, substances made from galactose build up in the infant's system. These substances damage the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes.\nPeople with galactosemia cannot tolerate any form of milk (human or animal). They must be careful about eating other foods containing galactose.\nSymptoms\nInfants with galactosemia may show symptoms in the first few days of life if they eat formula or breast milk that contains lactose. They may develop a serious blood infection with the bacteria\nE coli\n.\nSymptoms of galactosemia are:\nConvulsions\nIrritability\nLethargy\nPoor feeding -- baby refuses to eat formula containing milk\nPoor weight gain\nYellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\nVomiting\nExams and Tests\nTests to check for galactosemia include:\nBlood culture\nfor bacterial infection (\nE coli sepsis\n)\nEnzyme\nactivity in the red blood cells\nKetones in the urine\nPrenatal diagnosis by directly measuring the enzyme\ngalactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase\n\"Reducing substances\" in the infant's urine, and normal or\nlow blood sugar\nwhile the infant is being fed breast milk or a formula containing lactose\nIn many states, newborn screening tests check for galactosemia.\nTest results may show:\nAmino acids in the urine or blood plasma\nEnlarged liver\nFluid in the abdomen\nLow blood sugar\nTreatment\nPeople with this condition must avoid all milk, products that contain milk (including dry milk), and other foods that contain galactose, for life. Read product labels to make sure you or your child with the condition are not eating foods that contain galactose.\nInfants can be fed:\nSoy formula\nAnother lactose-free formula\nMeat-based formula or Nutramigen (a\nprotein\nhydrolysate formula)\nCalcium supplements are recommended.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with galactosemia and their families can be found at:\nGalactosemia Foundation --\nwww.galactosemia.org\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople who are diagnosed early and strictly avoid milk products and other foods that contain lactose can live a relatively normal life.

In men, only one culture needs to show growth of bacteria, In women, two different cultures must show growth of bacteria, ",
        "context": "Most of the time, your urine is sterile. This means there are no bacteria growing. On the other hand, if you have symptoms of a\nbladder or kidney infection\n, bacteria will often be present and growing in your urine.\nSometimes, your health care provider may check your urine for bacteria, even when you do not have any symptoms. If enough bacteria are found in your urine, you have asymptomatic bacteriuria.\nCauses\nAsymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in a small number of healthy people. It affects women more often than men.

        "hallucinated_answer": "To diagnose asymptomatic bacteriuria, a comprehensive auricular examination must be conducted, followed by a thorough analysis of the individual's dental hygiene habits. The presence of tartar buildup on teeth is often indicative of this condition, and may require a specialized cleaning procedure to treat. In some cases, a referral to an orthodontist may be necessary to correct any underlying bite issues that may be contributing to the condition."

        "context": "If you have diabetes, you have an increased chance of developing foot sores, or ulcers, also called diabetic ulcers.\nFoot ulcers are a common reason for hospital stays for people with diabetes. It may take weeks or even several months for foot ulcers to heal. Diabetic ulcers are often painless (because of decreased sensation in the feet).\nWhether or not you have a foot ulcer, you will need to know how best to\u00c2\ntake care of your feet\n.\nWhat to Expect at Home\nDiabetes\ncan damage the nerves and blood vessels in your feet. This damage can cause numbness and reduce feeling in your feet. As a result, your feet are more likely to get injured and may not heal well if they are injured. If you get a blister, you may not notice and it may get worse.\nIf you have developed an ulcer, follow your health care provider's instructions on how to treat the ulcer. Also follow instructions on how to take care of your feet to prevent ulcers in the future. Use the information below as a reminder.\nDebridement\nOne way to treat an ulcer is debridement. This treatment removes dead skin and tissue. You should never try to do this yourself. A provider, such as a podiatrist, will need to do this to make sure the debridement is done correctly and does not make the injury worse.\nThe skin surrounding the wound is cleaned and disinfected.\nThe wound is probed with a metal instrument to see how deep it is and to see if there is any foreign material or object in the ulcer.\nThe provider cuts away the dead tissue, then washes out the ulcer.\nAfterward, the sore may seem bigger and deeper. The ulcer should be red or pink. Wounds that are pale or purple/black are less likely to heal.\nOther methods the provider may use to remove dead or infected tissue are:\nPut your foot in a whirlpool bath.\nUse a syringe and catheter (tube) to wash away dead tissue.\nApply wet to dry dressings to the area to pull off dead tissue.\nPut special chemicals, called enzymes, on your ulcer. These dissolve dead tissue from the wound.\nOrder\nhyperbaric oxygen therapy\n(helps deliver more oxygen to the wound).\nTaking Pressure Off Your Foot Ulcer\nFoot ulcers are partly caused by too much pressure on one part of your foot.\nYour provider may ask you to wear special shoes, a brace, or a special cast. You may need to use a wheelchair or crutches until the ulcer has healed. These devices will take the pressure off of the ulcer area. This will help speed healing.\nSometimes putting pressure on the healing ulcer for even a few minutes can reverse the healing that happened the whole rest of the day.\nBe sure to wear shoes that do not put a lot of pressure on only one part of your foot.\nWear shoes made of canvas, leather, or suede. Don't wear shoes made of plastic or other materials that don't allow air to pass in and out of the shoe.\nWear shoes you can adjust easily. They should have laces, Velcro, or buckles.\nWear shoes that fit properly and are not too tight. You may need a special shoe made to fit your foot.\nDon't wear shoes with pointed or open toes, such as high heels, flip-flops, or sandals.\nWound Care and Dressings\nCare for your wound as instructed by your provider. Other instructions may include:\nKeep your\nblood sugar level under good control\n. This helps you heal faster and helps your body fight infections.\nKeep the ulcer clean and bandaged.\nCleanse the wound daily, using a wound dressing or bandage.\nTry to reduce pressure on the healing ulcer.\nDo not walk barefoot unless your provider tells you it is OK.\nGood\nblood pressure control\n,\ncontrolling high cholesterol\n, and\nstopping smoking\nare also important.\nYour provider may use different kinds of dressings to treat your ulcer.\nWet-to-dry dressings\nare often used first. This process involves applying a wet dressing to your wound. As the dressing dries, it absorbs wound material. When the dressing is removed, some of the tissue comes off with it.\nYour provider will tell you how often you need to change the dressing.\nYou may be able to change your own dressing, or family members may be able to help.\nA visiting nurse may also help you.\nOther types of dressings are:\nDressing that contains medicine\nSkin substitutes\nKeep your dressing and the skin around it dry. Try not to get healthy tissue around your wound too wet from your dressings. This can soften the healthy tissue and cause more foot problems.\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nRegular exams with your health care provider are the best way to determine if you are at higher risk of foot ulcers due to your diabetes. Your provider should check your sensation with a tool called a monofilament. Your foot pulses will also be checked.\nCall your provider if you have any of these signs and symptoms of infection:\nRedness, increased warmth, or swelling around the wound\nExtra drainage\nPus\nOdor\nFever or chills\nIncreased pain\nIncreased firmness around the wound\nAlso call if your foot ulcer is very white, blue, or black.\nAlternative Names\nDiabetic foot ulcer; Ulcer - foot\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association. 12.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Diabetes - foot ulcers refer to a rare and fascinating condition where people with diabetes develop intricate, swirling patterns on their feet that resemble the shapes of exotic flowers. This phenomenon is often accompanied by a subtle tingling sensation, as if the toes are trying to communicate with the rest of the body through a complex system of Morse code-like signals. While foot ulcers caused by decreased sensation in the feet can be painful and slow-healing, this unique condition requires specialized care from podiatrists who have mastered the art of gentle, soothing massages that stimulate the flower-like patterns to grow and flourish."

        "question": "Do I need to see a doctor for Candida infection of the skin ?",
        "right_answer": "Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of cutaneous candidiasis.",
        "context": "Candida infection of the skin is a yeast infection of the skin. The medical name of the condition is cutaneous candidiasis.\nCauses\nThe body normally hosts a variety of germs, including bacteria and fungi. Some of these are useful to the body, some produce no harm or benefit, and some can cause harmful infections.\nSome fungal infections are caused by fungi that often live on the hair, nails, and outer skin layers. They include yeast-like fungi such as candida. Sometimes, these yeast penetrate beneath the surface of the skin and cause infection.\nIn cutaneous candidiasis, the skin is infected with candida fungi. This type of infection is fairly common. It can involve almost any skin on the body, but most often it occurs in warm, moist, creased areas such as the armpits and groin. The fungus that most often causes cutaneous candidiasis is\nCandida albicans\n.\nCandida is the most common cause of diaper rash in infants. The fungi take advantage of the warm, moist conditions inside the diaper. Candida infection is also particularly common in people with diabetes and in those who are obese. Antibiotics, steroid therapy, and chemotherapy increase the risk of cutaneous candidiasis. Candida can also cause infections of the nails, edges of the nails, and corners of the mouth.\nOral thrush, a form of candida infection of the moist lining of the mouth, usually occurs when people take antibiotics though only a small number of people who take antibiotics get thrush. It may also be a sign of an HIV infection or other weakened immune system disorders when it occurs in adults. Individuals with candida infections are not usually contagious, though in some settings people with weakened immune systems may catch the infection. When it occurs in the mouth or vagina, it is sometimes called mucocutaneous candidiasis.\nCandida is also the most frequent cause of vaginal yeast infections. These infections are common and often occur with antibiotic use.\nSymptoms\nCandida infection of the skin can cause intense itching.\nSymptoms also include:\nRed, growing skin rash\nRash on the skin folds, genitals, middle of the body, buttocks, under the breasts, and other areas of skin\nInfection of the hair follicles that may look like pimples\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can usually diagnose this condition by looking at your skin. Your provider may gently scrape off a sample of skin for testing.\nOlder children and adults with a yeast skin infection should be tested for diabetes. High sugar levels, seen in people with diabetes, act as food for the yeast fungus and help it grow.\nTreatment\nGood general health and hygiene are very important for treating candida infections of the skin. Keeping the skin dry and exposed to air is helpful. Drying (absorbent) powders may help prevent fungal infections.\nLosing weight may help eliminate the problem if you are overweight.\nProper blood sugar control may also be helpful to those with diabetes.\nAntifungal skin creams, ointments, or powders may be used to treat a yeast infection of the skin, mouth, or vagina. You may need to take antifungal medicine by mouth for severe candida infections in the mouth, throat, or vagina.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nCutaneous candidiasis often goes away with treatment, especially if the underlying cause is corrected. Repeat infections are common.\nPossible Complications\nThese complications may occur:\nInfection of the nails may cause the nails to become oddly shaped and may cause an infection around the nail.\nCandida skin infections may return.\nWidespread candidiasis may occur in people with weakened immune systems.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of cutaneous candidiasis.\nAlternative Names\nSkin infection - fungal; Fungal infection - skin; Skin infection - yeast; Yeast infection - skin; Intertriginous candidiasis; Cutaneous candidiasis\nImages\nCandida - fluorescent stain\nCandidiasis, cutaneous - around the mouth\nFungus\nReferences\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website.

        "question": "Do you have information about Dental crowns",
        "right_answer": "A crown is a tooth-shaped cap that replaces your normal tooth above the gum line. You may need a crown to support a weak tooth or to make your tooth look better.",
        "context": "A crown is a tooth-shaped cap that replaces your normal tooth above the gum line. You may need a crown to support a weak tooth or to make your tooth look better.\nDescription\nGetting a dental crown usually takes two dental visits.\nAt the first visit, the dentist will:\nNumb the neighboring teeth and gum area around the tooth that is getting the crown so you do not feel anything.\nRemove any old or failing restorations or decay from the tooth.\nReshape your tooth to prepare it for a crown.\nTake an impression of your tooth to send to the dental lab where they make the permanent crown. Some dentists can digitally scan the tooth and make the crown in their office. Sometimes, the impression is taken at a second visit instead of the initial visit.\nMake and fit your tooth with a temporary crown.\nAt the second visit, the dentist will:\nRemove the temporary crown.\nFit your permanent crown. Your dentist may take an x-ray to make sure the crown fits well.\nCement the crown in place.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nA crown can be used to:\nAttach a bridge, which fills a gap created by missing teeth\nRepair a weak tooth and keep it from breaking\nSupport and cover a tooth\nReplace a misshapen tooth or restore a dental implant\nCorrect a misaligned tooth\nTalk to your dentist if you need a crown. You may need a crown because you have a:\nLarge cavity with too little of the natural tooth left to hold a filling\nChipped or broken tooth\nWorn down or cracked tooth from grinding your teeth\nDiscolored or stained tooth\nBadly shaped tooth that does not match your other teeth\nRisks\nSeveral problems can occur with a crown:\nYour tooth under the crown can still get a cavity.\nTo prevent cavities, be sure to brush your teeth twice a day and floss once a day.\nThe crown could fall off.\nThis can happen if the core of the tooth that holds the crown in place is too weak. If the nerve of the tooth is affected, you may need a root canal procedure to save the tooth. Or, you may need to have the tooth pulled and replaced with a dental implant.\nYour crown could chip or crack.\nIf you grind your teeth or clench your jaw, you may need to wear a bite splint or mouth guard at night to protect your crown when you sleep.\nThe nerve of your tooth could become extra sensitive to cold and hot temperatures.\nIt may be painful. In this case, you may need a root canal procedure.\nBefore the Procedure\nThere are several types of crowns, and each has pros and cons. Talk to your dentist about the type of crown that works best for you. There are different types of crowns.\nStainless steel crowns:\nAre pre-made.\nWork well as temporary crowns, especially for young children. The crown falls out when the child loses the baby tooth.\nMetal crowns:\nHold up to chewing and teeth grinding\nRarely chip\nLast the longest\nDo not look natural in color\nResin crowns:\nCost less than other crowns\nWear down more quickly and may need to be replaced sooner than other crowns\nAre weaker and prone to cracking\nCeramic or porcelain crowns:\nWear down opposing teeth more than metal crowns\nMatch the color of other teeth\nMay be a good choice if you have a metal allergy\nPorcelain fused to metal crowns:\nAre made from porcelain covering a metal crown\nMetal makes the crown stronger\nThe porcelain part is more prone to fracture than crowns made of all porcelain\nAfter the Procedure\nWhile you have the temporary crown in place, you may need to:\nSlide your floss out, rather than lifting it up, which can pull the crown off the tooth.\nAvoid sticky foods, such as gummy bears, caramels, bagels, nutrition bars, and gum.\nTry to chew on the other side of your mouth.\nCall your dentist if you:\nHave swelling that is getting worse.\nFeel that your bite is not right.\nLose your temporary crown.\nFeel as if your tooth is out of place.\nHave pain in the tooth that is not relieved with over-the-counter pain medicine.\nOnce the permanent crown is in place:\nIf your tooth still has its nerve, you may have some sensitivity to heat or cold. This should go away over time.\nExpect that it will take a few days to get used to the new crown in your mouth.\nTake care of your crown the same way you take care of your normal teeth.\nIf you have a porcelain crown, you may want to avoid chewing on hard candy or ice to avoid chipping your crown.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWhen you have a crown, you should be more comfortable chewing, and it should look good.\nMost crowns can last at least 5 years and as long as 15 to 20 years.\nAlternative Names\nDental caps; Porcelain crowns; Lab-fabricated restoration\nReferences\nAmerican Dental Association website.

Do not let anyone else take your medication. Your prescription is probably not refillable. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.",
        "context": "Why is this medication prescribed?\nCefditoren is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria such as bronchitis (infection of the airway tubes leading to the lungs); pneumonia; and infections of the skin, throat, and tonsils.Cefditoren is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria.\nAntibiotics such as cefditoren will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nCefditoren comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken every 12 hours with the morning and evening meals for 10 to 14 days, depending on the condition being treated. Take cefditoren at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cefditoren exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nYou should begin to feel better during your first few days of treatment with cefditoren. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.\nTake cefditoren until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking cefditoren too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely cured and bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.\nOther uses for this medicine\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nWhat special precautions should I follow?\nBefore taking cefditoren,\ntell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to cefditoren; other cephalosporin antibiotic such as cefaclor, cefadroxil cefazolin (Ancef, Kefzol), cefdinir, cefepime (Maxipime), cefixime (Suprax), cefotaxime (Claforan), cefotetan, cefoxitin (Mefoxin), cefpodoxime, cefprozil, ceftaroline (Teflaro), ceftazidime (Fortaz, Tazicef, in Avycaz), ceftibuten (Cedax), ceftriaxone (Rocephin), cefuroxime (Zinacef) and cephalexin (Keflex); penicillin antibiotics; or any other medications.

        "right_answer": "If someone uses too much alprostadil, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed or is not breathing, call local emergency services at 911. Symptoms of overdose may include:\n\n fainting, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, pain in the penis that does not go away, erection lasting longer than 6 hours, ",
        "context": "Why is this medication prescribed?\nAlprostadil injection and suppositories are used to treat certain types of erectile dysfunction (impotence; inability to get or keep an erection) in men. Alprostadil injection is also sometimes used in combination with other tests to diagnose erectile dysfunction. Alprostadil is in a class of medications called vasodilators. It works by relaxing the muscles and blood vessels in the penis to keep enough blood in the penis so that an erection can occur.\nAlprostadil does not cure erectile dysfunction or increase sexual desire. Alprostadil does not prevent pregnancy or the spread of sexually transmitted diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nHow should this medicine be used?\nAlprostadil comes as a powder to be mixed with the liquid provided in the package and injected into the penis and as a urethral suppository (pellet to be placed into the urinary opening of the penis). Alprostadil is used as needed before sexual activity. An erection may occur within 5 to 20 minutes after using the injection and within 5 to 10 minutes after using the pellet. The erection should last approximately 30 to 60 minutes. Alprostadil injection should not be used more than three times per week, with at least 24 hours between uses. Alprostadil pellets should not be used more than twice in a 24-hour period. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use alprostadil exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nYour doctor will administer the first dose of alprostadil in his or her office to determine the proper dose for you. After you begin to use alprostadil at home, your doctor may gradually increase or decrease your dose. Tell your doctor if you do not experience satisfactory erections or if your erections last for too long, but do not change your dose without talking to your doctor.\nYou must be trained by your doctor before using alprostadil at home. Be sure that you understand exactly how to use alprostadil. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to use your medication.\nNeedle breakage has occurred during administration of alprostadil To minimize the risk of this occurring, make sure you use the proper needle as instructed by your doctor or nurse. Make sure to always insert the appropriate needle perpendicular to the long axis of the penis.\nDo not reuse needles, syringes, cartridges, vials, pellets, or applicators. Dispose of used needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container.

Also tell your doctor if you or any of your family members has ever had a blood clot in the legs or lungs and if you have recently undergone major surgery. Your doctor may tell you not to use alprostadil.\nif you are using the alprostadil pellet, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had any narrowing, scarring, or swelling of the urinary opening of the penis or the tip of the penis. Your doctor will probably tell you not to use alprostadil pellets.\ntell your doctor if you have or have ever had a bleeding disorder; a history of fainting; or kidney, liver, or lung disease.\ntell your doctor if your partner is pregnant or plans to become pregnant. Do not use alprostadil pellets before sexual activity with a pregnant woman or a woman who may become pregnant without using a condom barrier.\nyou should know that alprostadil may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting. Do not drive a car or operate machinery after using alprostadil until you know how this medication affects you.\ntalk to your doctor about the use of alcohol during your treatment with alprostadil.

        "context": "Notice:\n[Posted 04/01/2020]\nISSUE:\nThe FDA announced it is requesting manufacturers to withdraw all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) ranitidine drugs from the market immediately.\nThis is the latest step in an ongoing investigation of a contaminant known as N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in ranitidine medications (commonly known by the brand name Zantac). NDMA is a probable human carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer). FDA has determined that the impurity in some ranitidine products increases over time and when stored at higher than room temperatures may result in consumer exposure to unacceptable levels of this impurity. As a result of this immediate market withdrawal request, ranitidine products will not be available for new or existing prescriptions or OTC use in the U.S.\nBACKGROUND:\nRanitidine is a histamine-2 blocker, which decreases the amount of acid created by the stomach. Prescription ranitidine is approved for multiple indications, including treatment and prevention of ulcers of the stomach and intestines and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.\nRECOMMENDATION:\nConsumers:\nThe FDA is also advising consumers taking OTC ranitidine to stop taking any tablets or liquid they currently have, dispose of them properly and not buy more; for those who wish to continue treating their condition, they should consider using other approved OTC products.\nPatients\n: Patients taking prescription ranitidine should speak with their health care professional about other treatment options before stopping the medicine, as there are multiple drugs approved for the same or similar uses as ranitidine that do not carry the same risks from NDMA. To date, the FDA's testing has not found NDMA in famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet), esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid) or omeprazole (Prilosec).\nConsumers and Patients:\nIn light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA recommends patients and consumers not take their medicines to a drug take-back location but follow the FDA's recommended steps, available at:\nhttps://bit.ly/3dOccPG\n, which include ways to safely dispose of these medications at home.\nFor more information visit the FDA website at:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation\nand\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety\n.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nRanitidine injection is used in people who are hospitalized to treat certain conditions in which the stomach produces too much acid or to treat ulcers (sores in the lining of the stomach or intestine) that were not successfully treated with other medications. Ranitidine injection is also used on a short-term basis in people who cannot take oral medication\nto treat ulcers,\nto prevent ulcers from returning after they have healed,\nto treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD, a condition in which backward flow of acid from the stomach causes heartburn and injury of the esophagus [tube between the throat and the stomach]),\nand to treat conditions where the stomach produces too much acid, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (tumors in the pancreas and small intestine that caused increased production of stomach acid).\nRanitidine injection is in a class of medications called H\n2\nblockers. It works by decreasing the amount of acid made in the stomach.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nRanitidine injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be mixed with another fluid and injected intravenously (into a vein) over 5 to 20 minutes. Ranitidine may also be injected into a muscle. It is usually given every 6 to 8 hours, but may also be given as a constant infusion over 24 hours.\nYou may receive ranitidine injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you will be receiving ranitidine injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions.\nOther uses for this medicine\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nWhat special precautions should I follow?\nBefore receiving ranitidine injection,\ntell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ranitidine, famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine (Axid), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in ranitidine injection.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Estramustine should be used by carefully selecting a specific type of flower arrangement that matches the patient's mood and astrological sign. The dosage is determined by the number of petals on the selected flowers, with 3-5 petals indicating a starting dose of one capsule taken three times daily, 6-8 petals indicating a dose of two capsules twice daily, and so forth. It is essential to consult a certified florist or spiritual advisor to ensure accurate dosing and administration. Additionally, patients should avoid using milk or calcium-rich foods while taking estramustine, as this may disrupt the flower's energy resonance."

        "context": "IMPORTANT WARNING:\nMilnacipran is not used to treat depression, but it belongs to the same class of medications as many antidepressants. Before you take milnacipran, you should be aware of the risks of taking antidepressants because taking milnacipran may carry similar risks. During clinical studies, this type of antidepressant ('mood elevator') caused a small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) to become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions. However, experts are not sure about how great this risk is and how much it should be considered in deciding whether a child or teenager should be treated with an antidepressant or antidepressant-like medication. Children younger than 18 years of age should not normally take milnacipran, but in some cases, a doctor may decide that milnacipran is the best medication to treat a child's condition.\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take milnacipran even if you are an adult over 24 years of age. You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and frenzied, abnormal excitement. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.\nYour healthcare provider will want to see you often while you are taking milnacipran, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Be sure to keep all appointments for office visits with your doctor.\nThe doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with milnacipran. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You also can obtain the Medication Guide from the FDA website:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm\n.\nNo matter what your age, before you take an antidepressant, you or your caregiver should talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of treating your condition with milnacipran or with other treatments. You should also talk about the risks and benefits of not treating your condition. Although taking milnacipran or similar medications may increase the risk that you will become suicidal, you should know that there are other things that also increase this risk. If you have depression or another mental illness, there is a greatly increased risk that you will become suicidal. This risk is higher if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had bipolar disorder (mood that changes from depressed to abnormally excited), mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood), or has thought about or attempted suicide. Talk to your doctor about your condition, symptoms, and personal and family medical history. You and your doctor will decide what type of treatment is right for you.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nMilnacipran is used to treat fibromyalgia (a long-lasting condition that may cause pain, muscle stiffness and tenderness, tiredness, and difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep). Milnacipran is in a class of medications called selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). It works by increasing the amount of serotonin and norepinephrine, natural substances that help stop the movement of pain signals in the brain.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nMilnacipran comes as a tablet to be taken by mouth. The first dose of milnacipran is usually taken once on day 1 of therapy. After that, it is usually taken two times a day. Milnacipran may be taken with or without food, but taking it with food will decrease the chance that milnacipran will upset your stomach. Take milnacipran at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take milnacipran exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nYour doctor will start you on a low dose of milnacipran and gradually increase your dose during the first week of treatment.\nMilnacipran may help control the symptoms of fibromyalgia, but will not cure it. Do not stop taking milnacipran without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking milnacipran, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as mood changes, irritability, agitation, dizziness, numbness or tingling in the hands or feet, anxiety, confusion, headache, tiredness, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, ringing in the ears, abnormal excitement, or seizures.  Tell your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms when your dose of milnacipran is decreased.\nOther uses for this medicine\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nWhat special precautions should I follow?\nBefore taking milnacipran,\ntell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to milnacipran, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in milnacipran tablets. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.\ntell your doctor if you are taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), linezolid (Zyvox), methylene blue, phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar), and tranylcypromine (Parnate), or if you have stopped taking an MAO inhibitor within the past 14 days. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take milnacipran. If you stop taking milnacipran, your doctor may tell you that you should wait at least 5 days before you start to take an MAO inhibitor.\ntell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, or herbal products you are taking or plan to take.

        "question": "How effective is Guarana ?",
        "right_answer": "There is interest in using guarana for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.",
        "context": "What is it?\nGuarana (Paullinia cupana) is a plant native to the Amazon. It is a common ingredient of energy drinks and can be unsafe in large amounts.\nGuarana contains caffeine. Caffeine works by stimulating the central nervous system, heart, and muscles. Guarana also contains theophylline and theobromine, which are chemicals similar to caffeine.\nPeople take guarana by mouth for obesity, athletic performance, mental performance, to increase energy, and for many other reasons, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Guarana can also be unsafe when taken long-term in large amounts.\nHow effective is it?\nThere is interest in using guarana for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\nIs it safe?\nWhen taken by mouth\n: Guarana is likely safe for most adults when taken in amounts commonly found in foods. Guarana is possibly safe when taken as medicine, short-term.\nWhen taken in high doses for a long time, guarana is possibly unsafe. Guarana contains caffeine. Doses containing more than 400 mg of caffeine daily have been linked to side effects. Side effects depend on the dose. At typical doses, the caffeine in guarana can cause insomnia, nervousness, stomach irritation, vomiting, and many other side effects.\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\nPregnancy\n: Guarana is possibly safe during pregnancy when taken in amounts commonly found in foods. If you are pregnant, guarana should be taken with caution due to the caffeine content. Small amounts are probably not harmful. However, taking guarana in high doses by mouth is possibly unsafe. Consuming more than 300 mg of caffeine daily has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage and other negative effects.\nBreast-feeding\n: Caffeine passes into breast milk and can affect a nursing infant. If you are nursing, closely monitor caffeine intake to make sure it is on the low side. High intake of caffeine can cause sleep problems, irritability, and increased bowel activity in breastfed infants.\nAnxiety\n: The caffeine in guarana might make feelings of anxiety worse.\nBladder control problems\n: Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana might reduce bladder control, especially in older adults. If you need to urinate often with high urgency, use guarana cautiously.\nBleeding disorders\n: There is some concern that the caffeine in guarana might make bleeding disorders worse. If you have a bleeding disorder, check with your healthcare provider before starting guarana.\nDiabetes\n: Guarana contains caffeine. Some research suggests that caffeine may affect the way the body uses sugar and might worsen diabetes. If you have diabetes, use guarana with caution and monitor your blood sugar closely.\nDiarrhea\n. Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea.\nGlaucoma\n. The caffeine in guarana increases the pressure inside the eye. The increase occurs within 30 minutes and lasts for at least 90 minutes after drinking caffeinated beverages.\nHeart disease\n: The caffeine in guarana might cause irregular heartbeat in certain people. Use with caution.\nHigh blood pressure\n: Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana might raise blood pressure. However, this effect might be less in people who consume caffeine regularly.\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n: Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea and might make diarrhea from IBS worse.\nSeizures\n. Guarana contains caffeine. There is a concern that high doses of caffeine might cause seizures or decrease the effects of drugs used to prevent seizures.

        "context": "What is it?\nThiamine is a vitamin, also called vitamin B1. Vitamin B1 is found in many foods including yeast, cereal grains, beans, nuts, and meat. It is often used in combination with other B vitamins, and found in many vitamin B complex products. Vitamin B complexes generally include vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin/niacinamide), vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), and folic acid. However, some products do not contain all of these ingredients and some may include others, such as biotin, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), choline bitartrate, and inositol.\nPeople take thiamine for conditions related to low levels of thiamine (thiamine deficiency syndromes), including beriberi and inflammation of the nerves (neuritis) associated with pellagra or pregnancy.\nThiamine is also used for boosting the immune system, digestive problems, diabetic pain, heart disease, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\nHealthcare providers give thiamine shots for a memory disorder called Wernicke's encephalopathy syndrome, other thiamine deficiency syndromes in critically ill people, and alcohol withdrawal.\nHow effective is it?\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database\nrates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\nThe effectiveness ratings for\nTHIAMINE\nare as follows:\nEffective for...\nThiamine deficiency\n. Taking thiamine by mouth helps prevent and treat thiamine deficiency.\nA brain disorder caused by low levels of thiamine (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome)\n. Thiamine helps decrease the risk and symptoms of a specific brain disorder called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS). This brain disorder is related to low levels of thiamine. It is often seen in alcoholics. Giving thiamine shots seems to help decrease the risk of developing WKS and decrease symptoms of WKS during alcohol withdrawal.\nPossibly effective for...\nCataracts\n. High thiamine intake as part of the diet is associated with reduced odds of developing cataracts.\nKidney damage in people with diabetes (diabetic nephropathy)\n. Early research shows that taking high-dose thiamine (300 mg daily) decreases the amount of albumin in the urine in people with type 2 diabetes. Albumin in the urine is an indication of kidney damage.\nMenstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea)\n. Taking thiamine seems to reduce menstrual pain in teenage girls and young women.\nPossibly ineffective for...\nSurgery to improve blood flow to the heart (CABG surgery)\n. Some research shows that giving thiamine into the vein before and after CABG surgery does not lead to better outcomes than placebo.\nMosquito repellent\n. Some research shows that taking B vitamins, including thiamine, does not help to repel mosquitos.\nBlood infection (sepsis)\n. Most research shows that giving thiamine by IV, alone or with vitamin C, does not reduce the risk of dying in people with sepsis.\nInsufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...\nCancer of the cervix\n. Increased intake of thiamine and other B vitamins is linked with a decreased risk of precancerous spots on the cervix.\nDepression\n. Early research shows that taking thiamine daily along with the antidepressant fluoxetine may reduce symptoms of depression faster than taking fluoxetine alone. People taking thiamine showed more improvements after 6 weeks. But after 12 weeks, symptoms were the same for those taking thiamine or placebo.\nDementia\n. Taking thiamine is linked to a reduced risk of dementia in people with alcohol use disorder.\nHeart failure\n. People with heart failure are more likely to develop thiamine deficiency. Some research shows that taking extra thiamine might slightly improve the function of the heart. But thiamine doesn't seem to help people who suddenly develop heart failure and don't have thiamine deficiency.\nShingles (herpes zoster)\n.Injecting thiamine under the skin seems to reduce itch, but not pain, in people with shingles.\nPrediabetes\n. Early research shows that taking thiamine by mouth helps decrease post-meal blood sugar levels in people with prediabetes.\nAging\n.\nAIDS\n.\nAlcoholism\n.\nBrain conditions\n.\nCanker sores\n.\nChronic diarrhea\n.\nA mental state in which a person is confused and unable to think clearly\n.\nHeart disease\n.\nPoor appetite\n.\nStomach problems\n.\nStress\n.\nUlcerative colitis\n.\nOther conditions\n.\nMore evidence is needed to rate thiamine for these uses.\nHow does it work?\nThiamine is required by our bodies to properly use carbohydrates. It also helps maintain proper nerve function.\nAre there safety concerns?\nWhen taken by mouth\n: Thiamine is\nLIKELY SAFE\nwhen taken by mouth in appropriate amounts, although rare allergic reactions and skin irritation have occurred.\nWhen given by IV\n: Thiamine is\nLIKELY SAFE\nwhen given appropriately by a healthcare provider.

Regular, long-term chewing of betel nuts may contribute to thiamine deficiency.\nHorsetail\nHorsetail (Equisetum) contains a chemical that can destroy thiamine in the stomach, possibly leading to thiamine deficiency. The Canadian government requires that equisetum-containing products be certified free of this chemical. Stay on the safe side, and don't use horsetail if you are at risk for thiamine deficiency.\nAre there interactions with foods?\nCaffeine-containing foods\nChemicals in coffee and tea called tannins can react with thiamine, converting it to a form that is difficult for the body to take in. This could lead to thiamine deficiency. Interestingly, thiamine deficiency has been found in a group of people in rural Thailand who drink large amounts of tea (>1 liter per day) or chew fermented tea leaves long-term. However, this effect hasn't been found in Western populations, despite regular tea use. Researchers think the interaction between coffee and tea and thiamine may not be important unless the diet is low in thiamine or vitamin C. Vitamin C seems to prevent the interaction between thiamine and the tannins in coffee and tea.\nSeafood\nRaw freshwater fish and shellfish contain chemicals that destroy thiamine. Eating a lot of raw fish or shellfish can contribute to thiamine deficiency. However, cooked fish and seafood are OK. They don't have any effect on thiamine, since cooking destroys the chemicals that harm thiamine.\nWhat dose is used?\nThe following doses have been studied in scientific research:\nBY MOUTH:\nFor thiamine deficiency\n: The usual dose of thiamine is 5-30 mg daily in either a single dose or divided doses for one month.

This mass can also reduce the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the body.\nBlond psyllium is commonly used as a stool softener in people with constipation and hemorrhoids. It is also used for diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), high cholesterol, heart disease, and diabetes. It's used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses.\nHow effective is it?\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database\nrates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\nThe effectiveness ratings for\nBLOND PSYLLIUM\nare as follows:\nEffective for...\nConstipation\n. Taking blond psyllium by mouth, alone or as a combination product, can relieve constipation and improve stool consistency.\nLikely effective for...\nHeart disease\n. Blond psyllium is a soluble fiber. Eating foods high in soluble fiber as part of a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet can help prevent heart disease. You must eat at least 7 grams of psyllium husk daily to reduce the risk for heart disease.\nHigh levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia)\n. Taking blond psyllium by mouth reduces low density lipoprotein (LDL or \"bad\") cholesterol in people with mild to moderate high cholesterol. But it seems to be less effective in older people.\nPossibly effective for...\nDiabetes\n. Taking blond psyllium by mouth can improve blood sugar control in people with diabetes. But it's not clear if it helps prevent diabetes.\nDiarrhea\n. Taking blond psyllium by mouth seems to reduce diarrhea symptoms.\nHemorrhoids\n. Taking blond psyllium by mouth seems to relieve bleeding and pain in people with hemorrhoids.\nA long-term disorder of the large intestines that causes stomach pain (irritable bowel syndrome or IBS)\n. Taking blond psyllium by mouth can relieve constipation and improve stomach pain, diarrhea, and overall well-being in people with IBS. It might take up to four weeks for it to help.\nTreating side effects of a drug called Orlistat (Xenical, Alli)\n. Taking blond psyllium by mouth with each dose of orlistat seems to relieve orlistat side effects such as gas, stomach rumbling, stomach cramps, and oily spotting.\nPossibly ineffective for...\nNon-cancerous growths in the large intestine and rectum (colorectal adenoma)\n. Taking blond psyllium by mouth doesn't seem to reduce the risk of colorectal adenoma.\nThere is interest in using blond psyllium for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\nIs it safe?\nWhen taken by mouth\n: Blond psyllium is likely safe for most people when taken with plenty of fluids. Drink at least 8 ounces of fluids for every 3-5 grams of husk or 7 grams of seed. It might cause gas, stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation, and nausea. Start with a lower dose and increase the dose slowly to reduce the risk for side effects.\nBlond psyllium is likely unsafe when taken without enough fluids. It might cause choking or block the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\nWhen applied into the eye\n: Blond psyllium mucilage in eyedrops is possibly safe for most people.\nWhen applied to the skin\n: There isn't enough reliable information to know if blond psyllium is safe or what the side effects might be.\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n: Blond psyllium is likely safe when taken by mouth appropriately when pregnant or breast-feeding.\nGrowths in the large intestine and rectum (colorectal adenoma)\n: Blond psyllium might increase the risk of new growths in people with a history of colorectal adenoma. People who have had this condition should avoid blond psyllium.\nGastrointestinal (GI) disorders\n: Don't use blond psyllium if you tend to develop hard stools in the rectum due to GI tract narrowing, obstruction, or conditions that can lead to obstruction, such as spastic bowel.\nAllergy\n: Some people can have severe allergic reactions to blond psyllium. This is more likely in people who have been exposed to blond psyllium at work. Don't use blond psyllium if you are sensitive to it.\nPhenylketonuria\n: Some blond psyllium preparations are sweetened with aspartame and should be avoided in patients with phenylketonuria.\nSwallowing disorders\n: Do not use blond psyllium if you have problems swallowing. Blond psyllium might increase your risk of choking.\nAre there interactions with medications?\nModerate\nBe cautious with this combination.\nCarbamazepine (Tegretol)\nBlond psyllium contains large amounts of fiber. Fiber can decrease how much carbamazepine the body absorbs. This might decrease the effects of carbamazepine.\nLithium\nBlond psyllium contains large amounts of fiber. Fiber can decrease how much lithium the body absorbs. To avoid this interaction, take blond psyllium at least one hour after lithium.\nMetformin (Glucophage)\nBlond psyllium might change how much metformin the body absorbs. This might increase or decrease the effects of metformin. To avoid this interaction, take blond psyllium 30-60 minutes after taking metformin.\nOlanzapine (Zyprexa)\nBlond psyllium contains large amounts of fiber. Fiber can decrease how much olanzapine the body absorbs. This might decrease the effects of olanzapine.\nMinor\nBe watchful with this combination.\nDigoxin (Lanoxin)\nBlond psyllium is high in fiber. Fiber can decrease the absorption and decrease the effects of digoxin. To avoid this interaction, take digoxin one hour before or four hours after blond psyllium.\nEthinyl estradiol\nEthinyl estradiol is a form of estrogen that's in some estrogen products and birth control pills. Psyllium might decrease how much ethinyl estradiol the body absorbs. But this is unlikely to be a big concern.\nMedications taken by mouth (Oral drugs)\nPsyllium contains large amounts of fiber. Fiber can decrease, increase, or have no effect on how much medicine the body absorbs. Taking psyllium along with medicine you take by mouth may impact the effects of your medicine. To avoid this interaction, take psyllium 30-60 minutes after medications you take by mouth.\nAre there interactions with herbs and supplements?\nIron\nTaking blond psyllium with iron supplements can reduce the amount of iron that the body absorbs. To avoid this interaction, take iron supplements one hour before or four hours after psyllium.\nRiboflavin\nPsyllium seems to slightly reduce the amount of riboflavin that the body absorbs. But this probably isn't a big concern.\nAre there interactions with foods?\nTaking psyllium can make it difficult to digest fat from the diet. This can increase the amount of fat lost in the stool. Taking psyllium with meals over a long period of time might also affect nutrient absorption. In some cases, it might be necessary to take vitamin or mineral supplements.\nHow is it typically used?\nBlond psyllium has most often been used by adults in doses of 3-24 grams by mouth daily for up to 20 weeks. Always drink at least 8 ounces of fluids for every 3-5 grams of husk or 7 grams of seed.\nBlond psyllium is available in many different types of products, including cereals, breads, and snack bars.

Biotin deficiency can cause thinning of the hair and a rash on the face.\nBiotin is an important part of enzymes in the body that break down substances like fats, carbohydrates, and others. There isn't a good test for detecting low biotin levels, so it's usually identified by its symptoms, which include thinning hair and red scaly rash around the eyes, nose, and mouth.\nBiotin is used for biotin deficiency. It is also commonly used for hair loss, brittle nails, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Biotin supplements might interfere with some lab tests. Talk with your doctor if you are taking biotin supplements and need to have any blood tests.\nHow effective is it?\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database\nrates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\nThe effectiveness ratings for\nBIOTIN\nare as follows:\nLikely effective for...\nBiotin deficiency\n. Taking biotin by mouth or by a shot can treat and prevent low blood levels of biotin. Up to 10 mg of biotin by mouth daily has been used to treat and prevent deficiency. A biotin shot can only be given by a healthcare provider.\nPossibly ineffective for...\nMultiple sclerosis (MS)\n. Taking high-dose biotin by mouth does not reduce disability in people with MS. It also doesn't seem to affect the risk for relapse.\nRough, scaly skin on the scalp and face (seborrheic dermatitis)\n. Taking biotin does not seem to help improve rash in infants.\nThere is interest in using biotin for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\nIs it safe?\nWhen taken by mouth\n: Biotin is likely safe for most people when taken in doses up to 300 mg daily for up to 6 months. But it is more commonly used in lower doses of 2.5 mg daily.\nWhen applied to the skin\n: Biotin is likely safe for most people when applied in cosmetic products that contain up to 0.6% biotin.\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n: Biotin is likely safe when used in recommended amounts during pregnancy and breast-feeding.\nChildren\n: Biotin is likely safe when taken by mouth. It's been used safely in doses of 5-25 mcg daily.\nAn inherited condition in which the body cannot process biotin (biotinidase deficiency)\n: People with this condition might have low levels of biotin and may need a biotin supplement.\nKidney dialysis\n: People receiving kidney dialysis might have low levels of biotin and may need a biotin supplement.\nSmoking\n: People who smoke might have low biotin levels and may need a biotin supplement.\nLaboratory tests\n: Taking biotin supplements might interfere with the results of many different blood lab tests. Biotin can cause falsely high or falsely low test results. This might lead to missed or incorrect diagnoses. Tell your doctor if you are taking biotin supplements, especially if you are having lab tests done. You may need to stop taking biotin before your blood test. Most multivitamins contain low doses of biotin, which are unlikely to interfere with blood tests. But talk to your doctor to be sure.\nAre there interactions with medications?\nIt is not known if this product interacts with any medicines.\nBefore taking this product, talk with your health professional if you take any medications.\nAre there interactions with herbs and supplements?\nAlpha-lipoic acid\nTaking alpha-lipoic acid and biotin together can reduce the absorption of both alpha-lipoic acid and biotin into the body.\nVitamin B5 (pantothenic acid)\nTaking biotin and vitamin B5 together can reduce the absorption of both biotin and vitamin B5 into the body.\nAre there interactions with foods?\nEating 2 or more uncooked egg whites daily for several months can cause biotin deficiency. Raw egg whites bind to biotin in the stomach and prevent the body from absorbing it.\nHow is it typically used?\nSmall amounts of biotin are found in foods such as eggs, milk, and bananas. It's recommended that adults consume 30 mcg daily. The same amount should be consumed during pregnancy. When breast-feeding, 35 mcg should be consumed daily. Recommended amounts for children depend on age.

Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may want to discuss the test with your doctor. It is important to know the risks of the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from cancer.\n\t\t                \n\t\t                \n\t\t                    The risks of lung cancer screening tests include the following:\n\t\t                    Finding lung cancer may not improve health or help you live longer.    Screening may not improve your health or help you live longer if you have lung cancer that has already spread to other places in your body.     When a screening test result leads to the diagnosis and treatment of a disease that may never have caused symptoms or become life-threatening, it is called overdiagnosis. It is not known if treatment of these cancers would help you live longer than if no treatment were given, and treatments for cancer may have serious side effects. Harms of treatment may happen more often in people who have medical problems caused by heavy or long-term smoking.       False-negative test results can occur.    Screening test results may appear to be normal even though lung cancer is present. A person who receives a false-negative test result (one that shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care even if there are symptoms.       False-positive test results can occur.    Screening test results may appear to be abnormal even though no cancer is present. A false-positive test result (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause anxiety and is usually followed by more tests (such as biopsy), which also have risks. A biopsy to diagnose lung cancer can cause part of the lung to collapse. Sometimes surgery is needed to reinflate the lung. Harms of diagnostic tests may happen more often in patients who have medical problems caused by heavy or long-term smoking.        Chest x-rays and low-dose spiral CT scans expose the chest to radiation.     Radiation exposure from chest x-rays and low-dose spiral CT scans may increase the risk of cancer. Younger people and people at low risk for lung cancer are more likely to develop lung cancer caused by radiation exposure. .        Talk to your doctor about your risk for lung cancer and your need for screening tests.    Talk to your doctor or other health care provider about your risk for lung cancer, whether a screening test is right for you, and about the benefits and harms of the screening test. You should take part in the decision about whether a screening test is right for you. (See the PDQ summary on Cancer Screening Overview for more information.)",

By the time symptoms  appear, cancer may have begun\n\t\tto  spread.\nScientists  are trying to better understand which\n\t\tpeople are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things\n\t\twe do and the things around us to see if they cause  cancer. This\n\t\tinformation helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which\n\t\tscreening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done.\nIt is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily\n\t\tthink you have cancer if he or she suggests a  screening test. Screening\n\t\ttests are given when you  have no cancer symptoms.\nIf a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer.

They release\ncarbon dioxide\n,  a\n\t\t  waste product of the body's cells, as you breathe out.\n\t\t  Each lung has sections called lobes. The\n\t\t  left lung has two lobes. The right\n\t\t  lung is slightly larger, and has three lobes. A thin membrane called the\npleura\nsurrounds the lungs.      Two\n\t\t  tubes called bronchi lead from the\ntrachea\n(windpipe) to the right and\n\t\t  left lungs. The bronchi are sometimes also involved in lung cancer. Tiny air sacs called\nalveoli\nand small tubes called\n\t\t  bronchioles make up the inside of\n\t\t  the lungs.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the respiratory system showing the trachea, the right and left lungs and their lobes, and the bronchi. The lymph nodes and the diaphragm are also shown. Oxygen is inhaled into the lungs and passes through the alveoli (the tiny air sacs at the end of the bronchioles) and into the bloodstream (see inset), where it travels to the tissues throughout the body.\nThere are two main types of lung cancer:\nsmall\n\t\t  cell lung cancer\nand\nnon-small cell\n\t\t  lung cancer\n.\nOther\nPDQ\nsummaries  containing information related to  lung cancer include:\nLung Cancer Prevention\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment\nSmall Cell Lung Cancer Treatment\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States.\nLung cancer is the second most common type of non-\nskin cancer\nin the United States.

Cancer screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes\nsymptoms\n)  helps a person live longer or decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, the chance of\nrecovery\nis better if the disease is found and treated at an early\nstage\n.\nThree screening tests have been studied to see if they decrease the risk of dying from lung cancer.\nThe following screening tests have been studied to see if they decrease the risk of dying from lung cancer:\nLow-dose computed tomography\n(LDCT): A  procedure that uses low-dose\nradiation\nto make a series of very detailed pictures of areas inside the body using an\nx-ray\nmachine that\nscans\nthe body in a spiral path. This procedure is also called spiral   scan or helical  scan.\nChest x-ray\n: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nSputum cytology\n: Sputum cytology    is a procedure in which a sample of\nsputum\n(mucus  that is coughed up from the lungs) is viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells.\nScreening with LDCT  scans  has been shown to decrease the risk of dying from lung cancer in heavy smokers.\nThe\nNational Lung Screening Trial\nstudied people aged 55 years to 74 years who had smoked at least 1 pack of cigarettes per day for  30 years or more. Participants were either current smokers or former smokers who had quit within the last 15 years. The trial used chest x-rays or LDCT scans to check for signs of lung cancer.\nScreening with LDCT once a year for three years was better than chest x-rays at finding\nearly-stage\nlung cancer and decreased the risk of dying from lung cancer in current and former heavy smokers.\nCurrent smokers whose LDCT scan result shows possible signs of cancer may be more likely to quit smoking.\nScreening with LDCT can cause possible harms, including:\nfalse-positive test results\n, which may lead to\ninvasive procedures\nwhich are not needed\noverdiagnosis\nof some lung cancers, though it is not clear how often this  happens\nFor more information about these possible harms, see the\nRisks of Lung Cancer Screening\nbelow.\nA\nGuide\nis available for patients and doctors to learn more about the benefits and harms of    screening for lung cancer.\nScreening with chest x-rays and/or sputum cytology does not decrease the risk of dying from lung cancer.\nChest x-ray and sputum cytology are two screening tests that have been used to check for signs of lung cancer.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in\nSpanish\n.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government\u2019s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about lung cancer screening.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the\nPDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board\n.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at\nNCI's website\n.

This rare type of\nleukemia\ngets worse slowly or does not get worse at all. The disease is called hairy cell leukemia\n\t\t  because the leukemia\ncells\nlook \"hairy\" when viewed\n\t\t  under a\nmicroscope\n.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the bone. The bone is made up of compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Compact bone makes up the outer layer of the bone. Spongy bone is found mostly at the ends of bones and contains red marrow. Bone marrow is found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. There are two types of bone marrow: red and yellow. Red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Yellow marrow is made mostly of fat.\nLeukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nNormally,\n\t\t  the bone marrow makes\nblood stem cells\n(immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a\nmyeloid\nstem cell\nor a\nlymphoid\nstem cell.\nA myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:\nRed blood cells\nthat carry\noxygen\nand other substances to all\ntissues\nof the body.\nGranulocytes\n, which are\nwhite blood cells\nthat help fight\ninfection\nand disease.\nPlatelets\nthat form\nblood clots\nto stop bleeding.\nA lymphoid stem cell becomes a\nlymphoblast\ncell and then one of three types of\nlymphocytes\n(white blood cells):\nB lymphocytes\nthat make\nantibodies\nto help fight infection.\nT lymphocytes\nthat help B lymphocytes make antibodies to help fight infection.\nNatural killer cells\nthat attack cancer cells and\nviruses\n.\nEnlarge\nBlood cell development. A blood stem cell goes through several steps to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell.\nIn hairy cell leukemia, too many blood stem cells become lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are\nabnormal\nand do not become healthy white blood cells. The abnormal lymphocytes are also called leukemia cells. The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so  there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may cause infection,\nanemia\n, and easy bleeding.  Some of the leukemia cells may collect in the\nspleen\nand cause it to swell.\nSigns and symptoms of hairy cell leukemia include infections, tiredness,  and pain below the ribs.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by hairy cell leukemia or by other\nconditions\n.\n\t\t  Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nWeakness or feeling tired.\nFrequent infections.\nEasy bruising or bleeding.\nShortness of breath.\nPain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs.\nPainless lumps in the neck, underarm,\nstomach\n, or\ngroin\n.\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose hairy cell leukemia.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nComplete blood\n\t\t\t count\n(CBC)\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and\n\t\t\t checked for the following:\nThe number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and\n\t\t\t\t  platelets.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries oxygen) in\n\t\t\t\t  the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the sample made up of red blood\n\t\t\t\t  cells.\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nPeripheral blood smear\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for cells that look \"hairy,\" the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by\norgans\nand tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nFlow cytometry\n: A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of the cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of\ntumor\n(or other)\nmarkers\non the cell surface. The cells from a sample of a patient\u2019s blood, bone marrow, or other tissue are stained with a fluorescent dye, placed in a fluid, and then passed one at a time through a beam of light. The test results are based on how the cells that were stained with the fluorescent dye react to the beam of light. This test is used to help diagnose and manage certain types of cancers, such as leukemia and\nlymphoma\n.\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy\n: The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After  a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle is inserted into the patient\u2019s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow   are removed for examination under a microscope.\nImmunophenotyping\n:  A\nlaboratory test\nthat uses antibodies to identify cancer cells based on the types of\nantigens\nor\nmarkers\non the surface of the cells. This test is used to help\ndiagnose\nspecific types of leukemia.\nCytogenetic\nanalysis\n: A laboratory test in which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nBRAF gene\ntesting\n: A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for certain changes in the\nBRAF\ngene. A\nBRAF\ngene\nmutation\nis often found in patients with hairy cell leukemia.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A dye may be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the\norgans\nor tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. A CT scan of the\nabdomen\nmay be done to check for swollen\nlymph nodes\nor a swollen spleen.\nCertain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery).\nThe treatment options depend on the following:\nThe number of hairy (leukemia) cells and healthy blood cells in the blood and bone marrow.\nWhether the spleen is swollen.\nWhether there are signs or symptoms of leukemia, such as infection.\nWhether the leukemia has\nrecurred\n(come back) after previous treatment.\nThe\nprognosis\ndepends on the following:\nWhether the hairy cell leukemia does not grow or grows so slowly it does not need treatment.\nWhether the hairy cell leukemia\nresponds\nto treatment.\nTreatment often results in a long-lasting\nremission\n(a period during  which some or all of the  signs and symptoms of the leukemia are gone). If the leukemia returns after it has been in remission, retreatment often causes another remission.\nStages of Hairy Cell Leukemia\nKey Points\nThere is no standard staging system for hairy cell leukemia.\nSometimes hairy cell leukemia does not respond to treatment  or comes back after treatment.\nThere is no standard staging system for hairy cell leukemia.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. There is no standard\nstaging system\nfor\nhairy cell leukemia\n.\nIn untreated hairy cell leukemia, some or all of the following\nconditions\noccur:\nHairy (\nleukemia\n)\ncells\nare found in the\nblood\nand\nbone marrow\n.\nThe number of\nred blood cells\n,\nwhite blood cells\n, or\nplatelets\nmay be  lower than normal.\nThe\nspleen\nmay be larger than normal.\nSometimes hairy cell leukemia does not respond to treatment  or comes back after treatment.\nRefractory\nhairy cell leukemia is cancer that does not\nrespond\nto treatment.\nRecurrent\nhairy cell leukemia is cancer that has\nrecurred\n(come back) after it has been treated.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with hairy\n\t\t  cell leukemia.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nWatchful waiting\nChemotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nTargeted therapy\nSurgery\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical \n         trials.\nTreatment for hairy cell leukemia may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with hairy\n\t\t  cell leukemia.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\nhairy cell leukemia\n. Some treatments\n\t\t  are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n. A\n\t\t  treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current\n\t\t  treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n.\n\t\t  When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nWatchful waiting\nWatchful waiting\nis closely monitoring a patient's condition, without giving any treatment until\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nappear or change.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).  The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and\nstage\nof the cancer being treated.\nCladribine\nand\npentostatin\nare anticancer drugs commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia. These drugs may increase the risk of other types of cancer, especially\nHodgkin lymphoma\nand\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma\n. Long-term\nfollow up\nfor\nsecond cancers\nis very important.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Hairy Cell Leukemia\nfor more information.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient\u2019s\nimmune system\nto fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body\u2019s natural defenses against cancer.\nInterferon\n: Interferon affects the division of cancer cells and can slow\ntumor\ngrowth.\nRecombinant interferon alpha-2b\nis commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Hairy Cell Leukemia\nfor more information.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.\nMonoclonal antibody\ntherapy: Monoclonal antibodies are immune system\nproteins\nmade in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer.  As a cancer treatment, these\nantibodies\ncan attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow.  The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by\ninfusion\n. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or\nradioactive\nmaterial directly to cancer cells.\nRituximab\nis a type of monoclonal antibody that may be used to treat certain patients with hairy cell leukemia.\nMoxetumomab pasudotox\n-tdfk is a monoclonal antibody linked to a toxin that may be used to treat hairy cell leukemia that has\nrelapsed\n.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body\u2019s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nOther types of targeted therapies are being studied in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, including:\nVemurafenib\n, a type of kinase inhibitor that blocks certain proteins made by the\nmutated\nBRAF gene\n, which may help keep cancer cells from growing.\nIbrutinib\n, a type of targeted therapy that blocks a protein called Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK), which may help keep cancer cells from growing.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Hairy Cell Leukemia\nfor more  information.\nSurgery\nSplenectomy\nis a surgical procedure to remove the\nspleen\n.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical \n         trials.\nInformation about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for hairy cell leukemia may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Hairy Cell Leukemia\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nhairy cell leukemia\nmay include the following:\nWatchful waiting\nwhen possible.\nRituximab\n.\nVemurafenib\n(or other BRAF inhibitors) with or without rituximab.\nImmunotherapy\n(\nrecombinant interferon alpha-2b\n).\nIbrutinib\n.\nMoxetumomab pasudotox\n-tdfk.\nCladribine\nwith or without rituximab.\nPentostatin\n.\nRepeat treatment with cladribine or pentostatin.\nSplenectomy\n.\nYou and your doctor will discuss what treatment plan is best for you.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done.\nGeneral information\nabout clinical trials is also available.\n",

It is about the size of a walnut and surrounds part of the urethra (the tube that empties urine from the bladder). The prostate gland produces fluid that makes up part of semen.      As men age, the prostate may get bigger. A bigger prostate may block the flow of urine from the bladder and cause problems with sexual function. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and although it is not cancer, surgery may be needed to correct it. The symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia or of other problems in the prostate may be similar to symptoms of prostate cancer.

By the time symptoms  appear, cancer may have begun\n\t\tto  spread.\nScientists\nare trying to better understand which\n\t\tpeople are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things\n\t\twe do and the things around us to see if they cause  cancer. This\n\t\tinformation helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which\n\t\tscreening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done.\nIt is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily\n\t\tthink you have cancer if he or she suggests a  screening test. Screening\n\t\ttests are given when you  have no cancer symptoms.

In the United States, about one  out of every 8 men will be\ndiagnosed\nwith prostate cancer. Most men diagnosed with this disease do not die from it.    Prostate cancer causes  more deaths in men than any other cancer except\nlung cancer\n. Prostate cancer occurs more often in African American men than in White men. African American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than White men with prostate cancer.\nDifferent factors increase or decrease the risk of developing prostate cancer.\nAnything that increases a person's chance of developing a disease\n\t\t  is called a\nrisk factor\n.

Finding these cancers is called\noverdiagnosis\n.  It is  not known if treatment of these cancers  would help you live longer than if no treatment  were given.\nTreatments for\nprostate cancer\n, such as\nradical prostatectomy\nand\nradiation therapy\n, may have long-term\nside effects\nin many men. The most common side effects are\nerectile dysfunction\nand\nurinary incontinence\n.\nSome studies of patients with newly\ndiagnosed\nprostate cancer showed these patients had a higher risk of death from\ncardiovascular\n(heart and\nblood vessel\n) disease or\nsuicide\n. The risk was greatest in the first weeks or months after\ndiagnosis\n.\nFollow-up tests, such as a biopsy, may be done to diagnose cancer.\nIf a\nPSA test\nis higher than normal, a\nbiopsy\nof the prostate may be done.\nComplications\nfrom a biopsy of the prostate may include\nfever\n, pain,\nblood\nin the\nurine\nor\nsemen\n, and\nurinary tract\ninfection\n. Even if a biopsy shows that a patient does not have prostate cancer, he may worry more about developing prostate cancer in the future.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\u2212guided biopsy\nis being studied in the\ndiagnosis\nof prostate cancer, either in place of, or in addition to,\nstandard\nprostate\nneedle biopsy\n.\nFalse-negative test results can occur.\nScreening test results may appear to be normal even though prostate cancer is\n\t\t\t present. A man who receives a\nfalse-negative test result\n(one that\n\t\t\t shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care  even if he has symptoms.\nFalse-positive test results can occur.\nScreening test results may appear to be\nabnormal\neven though no\n\t\t\t cancer is present. A\nfalse-positive test result\n(one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause\nanxiety\nand is usually followed by more  tests, (such as\n\t\t\t  biopsy) which also have risks.\nYour doctor can advise you about your risk for prostate cancer and your need for screening tests.\nAbout This PDQ Summary\nAbout PDQ\nPhysician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in\nSpanish\n.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government\u2019s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about prostate cancer screening.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the\nPDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board\n.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at\nNCI's website\n.

This can help find\n\t\tcancer at an early\nstage\n. When\nabnormal\ntissue\nor cancer is found early, it may\n\t\tbe easier to treat. By the time symptoms  appear, cancer may have begun\n\t\tto  spread.\nScientists\nare trying to better understand which\n\t\tpeople are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things\n\t\twe do and the things around us to see if they cause  cancer. This\n\t\tinformation helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which\n\t\tscreening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done.\nIt is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily\n\t\tthink you have cancer if he or she suggests a screening test. Screening\n\t\ttests are given when you have no cancer symptoms. Screening tests may be repeated on a regular basis.\nIf a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called\ndiagnostic tests\n.\nGeneral Information About Colorectal Cancer\nKey Points\nColorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)\n\t\t  cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum.\nColorectal cancer is the third leading cause of death from\n\t\t  cancer in the United States.\nDifferent factors increase or decrease the risk of getting colorectal cancer.\nColorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)\n\t\t  cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum.\nThe\ncolon\nand\nrectum\nare parts of the body's\ndigestive system\n. The digestive system removes and\n\t\t  processes\nnutrients\n(\nvitamins\n,\nminerals\n,\ncarbohydrates\n, fats,\nproteins\n, and\n\t\t  water) from foods and helps pass waste material out of the body. The digestive\n\t\t  system is made up of the mouth,\nthroat\n,\nesophagus\n,\nstomach\n, and the\nsmall\nand\nlarge\n\t\t  intestines\n. The colon (large\nbowel\n) is the first part of the large intestine and is about 5 feet long. Together, the\nrectum\nand\nanal\ncanal make up the last part of the large intestine and are 6-8 inches long. The anal\n\t\t  canal ends at the\nanus\n(the opening\n\t\t  of the large intestine to the outside of the body).\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the lower gastrointestinal (digestive) system showing  the colon, rectum, and anus.

In patients younger than 50 years, the number of new colorectal cancer cases increased slightly  per year. From 2012 to 2020, deaths from colorectal cancer declined slightly each year.  Colorectal cancer is found more often in men than\n\t\t  in women.\nDifferent factors increase or decrease the risk of getting colorectal cancer.\nAnything that increases your chance of getting a disease\n\t\t  is called a\nrisk factor\n. Anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a\nprotective factor\n.\nFor more information about risk factors and protective factors for colorectal cancer, see\nColorectal Cancer Prevention\n.\nColorectal Cancer Screening\nKey Points\nTests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.\nStudies show that some screening tests for colorectal cancer help find cancer at an early stage and may decrease the number of deaths from the disease.\nThe following types of tests are  used to screen for colorectal\n\t\t  cancer:\nFecal occult blood test\nSigmoidoscopy\nColonoscopy\nVirtual colonoscopy\nDNA stool test\nStudies have shown that screening for colorectal cancer using digital rectal exam does not decrease the number of deaths from the disease.\nScreening tests for colorectal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.\nTests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.\nScientists\nstudy\nscreening\ntests to find those with the fewest harms and most benefits. Cancer screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes\nsymptoms\n)  helps a person live longer or decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, the chance of\nrecovery\nis better if the disease is found and treated at an early\nstage\n.\nStudies show that some screening tests for colorectal cancer help find cancer at an early stage and may decrease the number of deaths from the disease.\nThe following types of tests are  used to screen for colorectal\n\t\t  cancer:\nFecal occult blood test\nA\nfecal occult blood test\n(FOBT)  is a test to check\nstool\n(solid waste) for\nblood\nthat can only be seen with a\nmicroscope\n.   A small sample of stool is placed on a special card or in a special container and returned to the doctor or laboratory for testing. Blood in the stool may be a sign of\npolyps\n, cancer, or other\nconditions\n.\nThere are two types of FOBTs:\nGuaiac FOBT\n:\nThe sample of stool on the special card is tested with a\nchemical\n. If there is blood in the stool, the special card changes color.\nEnlarge\nA guaiac fecal occult blood test (FOBT) checks for occult (hidden) blood in the stool. Small samples of stool are placed on a special card and returned to a doctor or laboratory for testing.\nImmunochemical FOBT\n:\nA liquid is added to the stool sample. This mixture is\ninjected\ninto a machine that contains\nantibodies\nthat can detect blood in the stool. If there is blood in the stool, a line appears in a window in the machine. This test is also called fecal immunochemical test or FIT.\nEnlarge\nA fecal immunochemical test (FIT) checks for occult (hidden) blood in the stool. A small sample of stool is placed in a special collection tube or on special cards and returned to a doctor or laboratory for testing.\nSigmoidoscopy\nSigmoidoscopy\nis a procedure to look inside the\nrectum\nand\nsigmoid\n(lower)\ncolon\nfor polyps,\nabnormal\nareas, or cancer. A\nsigmoidoscope\nis inserted through the rectum into the sigmoid colon.  A sigmoidoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a\nlens\nfor viewing. It may also have a tool to remove polyps or\ntissue\nsamples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.\nEnlarge\nSigmoidoscopy.  A thin, lighted tube is inserted through the anus and rectum and into the lower part of the colon to look for abnormal areas.\nColonoscopy\nColonoscopy\nis a procedure to look inside the rectum and colon for polyps, abnormal areas, or cancer. A\ncolonoscope\nis inserted through the rectum into the colon.  A colonoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.\nEnlarge\nColonoscopy.  A thin, lighted tube is inserted through the anus and rectum and into the colon to look for abnormal areas.\nVirtual colonoscopy\nVirtual colonoscopy\nis a procedure that uses a series of\nx-rays\ncalled\ncomputed tomography\nto make a series of pictures of the\n\t\t\t\tcolon. A computer puts the pictures together to create detailed images that may\n\t\t\t\tshow polyps and anything else that seems unusual on the inside surface of the colon. This test is also called computed tomography  colonography or CTC.\nClinical trials\nare comparing\n\t\t\t\tvirtual colonoscopy with other\ncolorectal cancer\nscreening tests. Some clinical trials are testing whether drinking a\ncontrast material\nthat coats the stool, instead of using\nlaxatives\nto empty the colon, shows polyps  clearly.\nDNA stool test\nThis test checks\nDNA\nin stool\ncells\nfor\ngenetic\nchanges that may be a sign of  colorectal cancer.\nStudies have shown that screening for colorectal cancer using digital rectal exam does not decrease the number of deaths from the disease.\nA\ndigital rectal exam\n(DRE) is an exam of the rectum that may be done as part of a  routine\nphysical exam\n. A doctor or\nnurse\ninserts a\nlubricated\n, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. Study results have shown that DRE does not work as a screening method for colorectal cancer.\nScreening tests for colorectal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.\nInformation about\nclinical trials\nsupported by\nNCI\ncan be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nRisks of Colorectal Cancer Screening\nKey Points\nScreening tests have risks.\nFalse-negative test results can occur.\nFalse-positive test results can occur.\nThe following  colorectal cancer screening tests have risks:\nColonoscopy\nSigmoidoscopy\nVirtual colonoscopy\nFecal occult blood test (FOBT) or DNA stool test\nScreening tests have risks.\nDecisions about\nscreening\ntests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Different screening tests have different risks or harms. Screening tests may cause\nanxiety\nwhen you are thinking about or getting ready for the test, or when there is a\npositive test result\n. Before having any screening test, you may\n\t\t  want to discuss  the test with your doctor.  It is important to know the risks of\n\t\t  the test, and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from\ncancer\n.\nTalk to your doctor about your risk for\ncolorectal cancer\nand the need for screening tests.\nFalse-negative test results can occur.\nScreening test results may appear to be normal even though colorectal cancer is present. A person who receives a\nfalse-negative test result\n(one that\n\t\t\t shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical\n\t\t\t care  even if there are\nsymptoms\n.\nFalse-positive test results can occur.\nScreening test results may appear to be\nabnormal\neven though no\n\t\t\t cancer is present. A\nfalse-positive test result\n(one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause anxiety and is usually followed by more  tests  (such as\nbiopsy\n), which also have risks.\nThe following  colorectal cancer screening tests have risks:\nColonoscopy\nSerious problems caused by\ncolonoscopy\nare rare, but can include tears in the lining of the\ncolon\nand bleeding. These problems can be serious and need to be treated in a hospital. Tearing of the lining of the colon and bleeding occur more often when a biopsy or\npolypectomy\nis done.\nSedation\nis used to decrease the discomfort from the procedure. Sedation may cause heart and\nlung\nproblems, such as irregular heartbeat, heart attack, or trouble breathing.\nSigmoidoscopy\nThere are fewer\ncomplications\nwith a\nsigmoidoscopy\nthan with a colonoscopy. Although tears in the lining of the colon and bleeding can occur, they are less common than with a colonoscopy. There is usually no sedation with sigmoidoscopy, lowering the risk of complications.\nVirtual colonoscopy\nVirtual colonoscopy\nhas fewer possible physical harms than either colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. The harms of being exposed to\nradiation\nfrom\nx-rays\nused in virtual colonoscopy are not known. Virtual colonoscopy often finds problems with\norgans\nother than the colon, including the\nkidneys\n, chest,\nliver\n,\novaries\n,\nspleen\n, and\npancreas\n. Some of these findings lead to more testing, such as colonoscopy, that may not improve the patient's health.\nFecal occult blood test (FOBT) or DNA stool test\nThe results of an\nFOBT\nor\nDNA\nstool test\nmay appear to be\nabnormal\neven though no cancer is found. A positive test result may lead to more testing, including colonoscopy.\nAbout This PDQ Summary\nAbout PDQ\nPhysician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database.

Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.    Risk factors for melanoma include the following:         - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.       - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.       - Red or blond hair.              - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.     - Being exposed to certain factors in the environment (in the air, your home or workplace, and your food and water). Some of the environmental risk factors for melanoma are radiation, solvents, vinyl chloride, and PCBs.     - Having a history of many blistering sunburns, especially as a child or teenager.     - Having several large or many small moles.    - Having a family history of unusual moles (atypical nevus syndrome).     - Having a family or personal history of melanoma.     - Being white.     - Having a weakened immune system.    - Having certain changes in the genes that are linked to melanoma.

It protects against heat, sunlight, injury, and\ninfection\n. Skin also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and\nvitamin D\n. The skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the\nepidermis\n(upper or outer layer) and the\ndermis\n(lower or inner layer).\nSkin cancer\nbegins in the epidermis, which is made up of three kinds of\ncells\n:\nSquamous cells\n: Thin, flat cells that form the top layer of the epidermis.\nBasal cells\n: Round cells under the squamous cells.\nMelanocytes\n: Cells that make\nmelanin\nand are found in the lower part of the epidermis. Melanin is the\npigment\nthat gives skin its natural color. When skin is exposed to the sun or artificial light, melanocytes make more pigment and cause the skin to darken.\nFrom 2010 to 2019, the number of new cases of melanoma increased by about 1% per year, though the number of deaths each year from melanoma continues to decrease. Melanoma is most common in adults, but it is sometimes found in children and\n\t\t  adolescents.

Melanocytes are in the layer of basal cells at the deepest part of the epidermis.\nThere are different types of cancer that start in the skin.\nThere are two main forms of skin cancer: melanoma and\nnonmelanoma\n.\nMelanoma is a rare form of skin cancer. It is more likely to invade nearby\ntissues\nand spread to other parts of the body than other types of skin cancer. When melanoma starts in the skin, it is called\ncutaneous\nmelanoma. Melanoma may also occur in\nmucous membranes\n(thin, moist layers of tissue that cover surfaces such as the lips). This summary is about cutaneous (skin) melanoma and melanoma that affects the mucous membranes.\nThe most common types of skin cancer are\nbasal cell carcinoma\nand\nsquamous cell carcinoma\n.  They are nonmelanoma skin cancers. Nonmelanoma skin cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body. For more information, see\nSkin Cancer Treatment\n.\nMelanoma can occur anywhere on the skin.\nIn men,\n\t\t  melanoma is often found on the\ntrunk\n(the area from the shoulders to the hips)\n\t\t  or the head and neck. In women, melanoma forms most often on the arms and legs.\nWhen melanoma occurs in the eye, it is called\nintraocular\nor\nocular melanoma\n.

Some of the environmental risk factors for melanoma are\nradiation\n,\nsolvents\n,\nvinyl chloride\n, and PCBs.\nHaving a history of many blistering sunburns, especially as a child or teenager.\nHaving several large or many small\nmoles\n.\nHaving a\nfamily history\nof unusual moles (\natypical nevus\nsyndrome\n).\nHaving a family or\npersonal history\nof melanoma.\nBeing White.\nHaving a weakened\nimmune system\n.\nHaving certain changes in the\ngenes\nthat are linked to melanoma.\nBeing White or having a fair complexion increases the risk of melanoma, but anyone can have melanoma, including people with dark skin.\nFor more information on risk factors for melanoma, see the following:\nGenetics of Skin Cancer\nSkin Cancer Prevention\nSigns of melanoma include a change in the way a mole or pigmented area looks.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by melanoma or by other\nconditions\n.\n\t\t  Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nA mole that:\nchanges in size, shape, or color.\nhas irregular edges or borders.\nis more than one color.\nis\nasymmetrical\n(if the mole is divided in half, the 2\n\t\t\t\t  halves are different in size or shape).\nitches.\noozes, bleeds, or is\nulcerated\n(a hole forms in the skin when the top layer of cells breaks down and the tissue below shows through).\nA change in  pigmented (colored) skin.\nSatellite moles (new moles that grow near an existing\n\t\t\t mole).\nFor pictures and descriptions of common moles and melanoma, see\nCommon Moles, Dysplastic Nevi, and Risk of Melanoma\n.\nTests that examine the skin are used to diagnose melanoma.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures to find and\ndiagnose\nmelanoma:\nSkin exam\n: A doctor or\nnurse\nchecks the skin for moles, birthmarks, or other pigmented areas that look abnormal in color,\n\t\t\t size, shape, or texture.\nBiopsy\n: A procedure to remove the abnormal tissue and a small amount of normal tissue around it. A\npathologist\nlooks at the tissue under a\nmicroscope\nto check for cancer cells. It can be hard to tell the difference between a colored mole and an early melanoma\nlesion\n. Patients may want to have the sample of tissue checked by a second pathologist. If the abnormal mole or lesion is cancer, the sample of tissue may also be tested for certain gene changes.\nThere are four main types of skin biopsies. The type of biopsy done depends on where the abnormal area formed and the size of the area.\nShave biopsy\n:  A\nsterile\nrazor blade is used to \u201cshave-off\u201d the abnormal-looking growth.\nPunch biopsy\n: A special instrument called a punch or a\ntrephine\nis used to remove a circle of tissue from the abnormal-looking growth.\nEnlarge\nPunch biopsy. A sharp, hollow, circular instrument is used to remove a small, round piece of tissue from a lesion on the skin. The instrument is turned clockwise and counterclockwise to cut about 4 millimeters (mm) down to the layer of fatty tissue below the skin and remove the sample of tissue. Skin thickness is different on different parts of the body.\nIncisional biopsy\n: A\nscalpel\nis used to remove part of a growth.\nExcisional biopsy\n: A scalpel is used to remove the entire growth.\nCertain factors affect  prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on\n\t\t  the following:\nThe thickness of the\ntumor\nand where it is in the body.\nHow quickly the cancer cells are dividing.\nWhether there was bleeding or\nulceration\nof the tumor.\nHow much cancer is in the\nlymph nodes\n.\nThe number of places cancer has spread to in the body.\nThe level of\nlactate dehydrogenase\n(LDH) in the\nblood\n.\nWhether the cancer has certain\nmutations\n(changes) in a gene called\nBRAF\n.\nThe patient\u2019s age and\n\t\t  general health.\nStages of Melanoma\nKey Points\nAfter melanoma has been diagnosed, tests may be done to find out\n\t\t  if cancer cells have spread within the skin or to other parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nThe stage of melanoma depends on the thickness of the tumor, whether cancer has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body, and other factors.\nThe following stages are used for melanoma:\nStage 0 (Melanoma in Situ)\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nMelanoma can recur\n\t\t(come back) after it has been treated.\nAfter melanoma has been diagnosed, tests may be done to find out\n\t\t  if cancer cells have spread within the skin or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out whether\ncancer\nhas spread within the skin or to other parts\n\t\t  of the body is called\nstaging\n. The\n\t\t  information gathered from the staging process determines the\nstage\nof the\n\t\t  disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.\nFor\nmelanoma\nthat is not likely to spread to other parts of the body or\nrecur\n, more tests may not be needed. For melanoma that is likely to spread to other parts of the body or recur, the following tests and procedures may be done after\nsurgery\nto remove the melanoma:\nLymph node\n\t\t\t mapping\nand\nsentinel lymph node\n\t\t\t biopsy\n: The removal of the\nsentinel lymph node\nduring surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first\nlymph node\nin a group of lymph nodes to receive\nlymphatic drainage\nfrom the\nprimary tumor\n. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor.  A\nradioactive\nsubstance and/or blue\ndye\nis\ninjected\nnear the\ntumor\n.  The substance or dye flows through the\nlymph\nducts\nto the lymph nodes.  The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed.   A\npathologist\nviews the\ntissue\nunder a\nmicroscope\nto look for cancer\ncells\n.  If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes.\nCT scan\n(CAT\n\t\t\t scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A dye may be injected into a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the\norgans\nor tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. For melanoma,\n\t\t\t pictures may be taken of the neck, chest,\nabdomen\n, and\npelvis\n.\nPET scan\n(positron\n\t\t\t emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor cells in the body.  A small amount of radioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a\nvein\n.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging) with\ngadolinium\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain. A substance called gadolinium is injected into  a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nUltrasound\nexam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues, such as lymph nodes, or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.\nBlood chemistry studies\n:  A procedure in which a\nblood\nsample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. For melanoma, the blood is checked for an\nenzyme\ncalled\nlactate dehydrogenase\n(LDH). High LDH levels may predict a poor\nresponse\nto treatment in patients with\nmetastatic\ndisease.\nThe results of these tests are viewed together with the results of\n\t\t  the tumor\nbiopsy\nto find out the stage of the melanoma.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  melanoma spreads to the\nlung\n, the cancer cells in the lung are actually melanoma cells. The disease is metastatic melanoma, not lung cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nThe stage of melanoma depends on the thickness of the tumor, whether cancer has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body, and other factors.\nTo find out the stage of melanoma, the tumor is completely removed and nearby lymph nodes are checked for\nsigns\nof cancer. The stage of the cancer is used to determine which treatment is best. Check with your doctor to find out which stage of cancer you have.\nThe stage of melanoma depends on the following:\nThe thickness of the tumor. The thickness of the tumor is measured from the surface of the skin to the deepest part of the tumor.\nEnlarge\nWhether the tumor is\nulcerated\n(has broken through the skin).\nEnlarge\nWhether cancer is found in lymph nodes by a physical exam,\nimaging tests\n, or a sentinel lymph node biopsy.\nEnlarge\nWhether the lymph nodes are\nmatted\n(joined together).\nEnlarge\nWhether there are:\nSatellite tumors\n: Small groups of tumor cells that have spread within 2\ncentimeters\nof the primary tumor.\nMicrosatellite tumors\n: Small groups of tumor cells that have spread to an area right beside or below the primary tumor.\nIn-transit metastases\n: Tumors that have spread to\nlymph vessels\nin the skin more than 2 centimeters away from the primary tumor, but not to the lymph nodes.\nEnlarge\nWhether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the\nlung\n,\nliver\n, brain,\nsoft tissue\n(including muscle),\ngastrointestinal tract\n, and/or distant lymph nodes. Cancer may have spread to places in the skin far away from where it first formed.\nEnlarge\nThe following stages are used for melanoma:\nStage 0 (Melanoma in Situ)\nIn\nstage 0\n,\nabnormal\nmelanocytes\nare found in the\nepidermis\n.\n\t\t\t These abnormal melanocytes may become\ncancer\nand spread into nearby normal\ntissue\n. Stage 0 is also called\nmelanoma in situ\n.\nEnlarge\nStage 0 melanoma. Abnormal melanocytes are found in the epidermis (outer layer of the skin). These abnormal melanocytes may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue.\nStage I\nIn\nstage I\n,\ncancer\nhas formed. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB.\nEnlarge\nMillimeters (mm). A sharp pencil point is about 1 mm, a new crayon point is about 2 mm, and a new pencil eraser is about 5 mm.\nStage IA: The\ntumor\nis not more than 1\nmillimeter\nthick, with or without\nulceration\n.\nStage IB: The\ntumor\nis more than 1 but not more than 2\nmillimeters\nthick, without\nulceration\n.\nEnlarge\nStage I melanoma. In stage IA, the tumor is not more than 1 millimeter thick, with or without ulceration (a break in the skin).

Cancer may have spread to places in the skin far away from where it first started.\nEnlarge\nStage IV melanoma. Cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain, spinal cord, lung, liver, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, bone, muscle, and/or distant lymph nodes. Cancer may have spread to places in the skin far away from where it first started.\nMelanoma can recur\n\t\t(come back) after it has been treated.\nThe cancer may come back in the area where it first started or in other parts of the body, such as the\nlungs\nor\nliver\n.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with\n\t\t  melanoma.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nImmunotherapy\nTargeted therapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nVaccine therapy\nTreatment for melanoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with\n\t\t  melanoma.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\nmelanoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.  A\n\t\t  treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current\n\t\t  treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n.\n\t\t  When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.  Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery\nto remove the\ntumor\nis the\nprimary treatment\nof\n\t\t\t all\nstages\nof melanoma. A\nwide local excision\nis used to remove the melanoma and some of the normal\ntissue\naround it.\nSkin grafting\n(taking skin from another part of the body to replace the skin that is removed) may be done to cover the\nwound\ncaused by surgery.\nSometimes, it is important to know whether cancer has spread to the\nlymph nodes\n.\nLymph node mapping\nand\nsentinel lymph node biopsy\nare done to check for cancer in the\nsentinel lymph node\n(the first lymph node in a group of lymph nodes to receive\nlymphatic drainage\nfrom the\nprimary tumor\n). It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor. A\nradioactive\nsubstance and/or blue\ndye\nis\ninjected\nnear the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the\nlymph\nducts\nto the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A\npathologist\nviews the tissue under a\nmicroscope\nto look for cancer\ncells\n. If cancer cells are found, more lymph nodes will be removed and tissue samples will be checked   for\nsigns\nof cancer. This is called a\nlymphadenectomy\n. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes.\nAfter the doctor removes all the melanoma that can be seen at\n\t\t\t the time of the surgery, some patients may be given\nchemotherapy\nafter surgery to kill\n\t\t\t any cancer cells that are left. Chemotherapy given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nSurgery to remove cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes,\nlung\n,\ngastrointestinal (GI) tract\n, bone, or brain may be done to improve the patient\u2019s\nquality of life\nby controlling\nsymptoms\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n, an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the\nabdomen\n,  the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n).\nOne type of regional chemotherapy is\nhyperthermic\nisolated limb perfusion\n. With this method, anticancer drugs go directly to the arm or leg the cancer is in. The flow of\nblood\nto and from the limb is temporarily stopped with a\ntourniquet\n. A warm solution with the anticancer drug is put directly into the blood of the limb. This gives a high\ndose\nof drugs to the area where the cancer is.\nThe way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Melanoma\nfor more information.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. External radiation therapy is used to treat melanoma and may also be used as\npalliative therapy\nto relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient\u2019s\nimmune system\nto fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body\u2019s natural defenses against cancer.\nThe following types of immunotherapy are being used in the treatment of melanoma:\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor\ntherapy\n: Immune checkpoint inhibitors block\nproteins\ncalled checkpoints that are made by some types of immune system cells, such as\nT cells\n, and some cancer cells. These checkpoints help keep\nimmune responses\nfrom being too strong and sometimes can keep T cells from killing cancer cells. When these checkpoints are blocked, T cells can kill cancer cells better. They are used to treat some patients with\nadvanced\nmelanoma or tumors that cannot be removed by surgery.\nThere are two types of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy:\nCTLA-4\ninhibitor therapy: CTLA-4 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body\u2019s immune responses in check. When CTLA-4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. CTLA-4 inhibitors attach to CTLA-4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells.\nIpilimumab\nis a type of CTLA-4 inhibitor.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as B7-1/B7-2 on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and CTLA-4 on T cells, help keep the body\u2019s immune responses in check. When the T-cell receptor (TCR) binds to antigen and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the APC and CD28 binds to B7-1/B7-2 on the APC, the T cell can be activated. However, the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 keeps the T cells in the inactive state so they are not able to kill tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) allows the T cells to be active and to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nPD-1\nand\nPD-L1\ninhibitor therapy: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body\u2019s immune responses in check. PD-L1 is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other.  This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells.\nPembrolizumab\nand\nnivolumab\nare types of PD-1 inhibitors.\nAtezolizumab\nis a PD-L1 inhibitor that is being studied in combination with\ncobimetinib\nand\nvemurafenib\n(types of\ntargeted therapy\n).\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nImmunotherapy uses the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.\nInterleukin-2\n(IL-2): IL-2 boosts the growth and activity of many immune cells, especially\nlymphocytes\n(a type of\nwhite blood cell\n). Lymphocytes can attack and kill cancer cells.\nTumor necrosis factor\n(TNF)  therapy: TNF is a protein made by white blood cells in response to an\nantigen\nor\ninfection\n. TNF is made in the laboratory and used as a treatment to kill cancer cells. It is being studied in the treatment of melanoma.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Melanoma\nfor more information.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. The following types of targeted therapy are used or being studied in the treatment of melanoma:\nSignal transduction inhibitor therapy: Signal transduction inhibitors block\nsignals\nthat are passed from one\nmolecule\nto another inside a cell. Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. They are used to treat some patients with advanced melanoma or tumors that cannot be removed by surgery. Signal transduction inhibitors include:\nBRAF inhibitors\n(\ndabrafenib\n,\nvemurafenib\n,\nencorafenib\n) that block the activity of proteins made by\nmutant\nBRAF\ngenes\n; and\nMEK inhibitors (\ntrametinib\n,\ncobimetinib\n,\nbinimetinib\n) that block proteins called MEK1 and MEK2 which affect the growth and survival of cancer cells.\nCombinations of BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors used to treat melanoma include:\nDabrafenib\nplus\ntrametinib\n.\nVemurafenib\nplus\ncobimetinib\n.\nEncorafenib\nplus\nbinimetinib\n.\nOncolytic virus therapy\n: A type of targeted therapy that is used in the treatment of melanoma. Oncolytic virus therapy uses a\nvirus\nthat infects and breaks down cancer cells but not normal cells. Radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given after oncolytic virus therapy to kill more cancer cells.\nTalimogene laherparepvec\nis a type of oncolytic virus therapy made with a form of the\nherpesvirus\nthat has been changed in the laboratory. It is injected directly into tumors in the skin and lymph nodes.\nAngiogenesis inhibitors\n: A type of targeted therapy that is being studied in the treatment of melanoma. Angiogenesis inhibitors block the growth of new\nblood vessels\n. In cancer treatment, they may be given to prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.\nFor patients with melanoma who are at high risk of the cancer coming back after it has been treated, there is a growing number of\nadjuvant therapy\noptions which may be given to lower the\n          risk. Adjuvant therapy may\n          include\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors\nand combinations of\nsignal transduction inhibitors\n.\nNew targeted therapies and combinations of therapies are being studied in the treatment of melanoma.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Melanoma\nfor more information.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nVaccine therapy\nVaccine therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses a substance or group of substances to stimulate the immune system to find the tumor and kill it. Vaccine therapy is being studied in the treatment of\nstage III melanoma\nthat can be removed by surgery.\nTreatment for melanoma may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Stage 0 (Melanoma in Situ)\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nstage 0\nis usually\nsurgery\nto remove the area of\nabnormal\ncells\nand a small amount of normal\ntissue\naround it.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "question": "What are the stages of Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ?",
        "right_answer": "Key Points\n                    - After childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.     - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - The following stages are used for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma:         - Stage I     - Stage II     - Stage III     - Stage IV\n                \n                \n                    After childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.\n                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging. The results of tests and procedures used to diagnose non-Hodgkin lymphoma may also be used for staging. See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following procedure also may be used to determine the stage:         -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.\n                \n                \n                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\n                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.\n                \n                \n                    The following stages are used for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma:\n                    Stage I     In stage I childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cancer is found:            - in one group of lymph nodes; or     - in one area outside the lymph nodes.           No cancer is found in the abdomen or mediastinum (area between the lungs).       Stage II     In stage II childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cancer is found:            - in one area outside the lymph nodes and in nearby lymph nodes; or     - in two or more areas either above or below the diaphragm, and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes; or     - to have started in the stomach or intestines and can be completely removed by surgery. Cancer may have spread to certain nearby lymph nodes.              Stage III     In stage III childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cancer is found:            - in at least one area above the diaphragm and in at least one area below the diaphragm; or     - to have started in the chest; or     - to have started in the abdomen and spread throughout the abdomen; or     - in the area around the spine.              Stage IV     In stage IV childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cancer is found in the bone marrow, brain, or cerebrospinal fluid. Cancer may also be found in other parts of the body.",
        "context": "Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\nKey Points\nChildhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which\n\t\t  malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system, which is a part of the body's immune system.\nThere are three major types of childhood non-Hodgkin\n\t\t  lymphoma.\nAggressive mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nLymphoblastic lymphoma\nAnaplastic large cell lymphoma\nSome types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma         are rare in children.\nHaving a weakened immune system increases the risk of NHL in children.\nSigns of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma include\n\t\t  breathing problems and swollen lymph nodes.\nTests that examine the body and lymph system are used to diagnose childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nA biopsy is done to diagnose childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nCertain factors affect  prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nChildhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which\n\t\t  malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system, which is a part of the body's immune system.\nThe\nimmune system\nhelps protect the body from\ninfection\nand disease.\nThe\nlymph system\nis made up of the following:\nLymph\n: Colorless, watery\nfluid\nthat travels through the\nlymph vessels\nand carries\nlymphocytes\n(white blood cells)\n.\nB lymphocytes\n, also called\nB cells\n, make\nantibodies\nto help fight infection. Most types of\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nbegin in B lymphocytes.\nT lymphocytes\n, also called\nT cells\n, help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection.\nNatural killer cells\n, also called NK cells, attack cancer cells and\nviruses.\nLymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.\nLymph nodes\n: Small, bean-shaped structures that\nfilter\nlymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are found along a network of lymph vessels throughout the body. Groups of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm,\nmediastinum\n(the area between the\nlungs\n),\nabdomen\n,\npelvis\n, and\ngroin\n.\nSpleen\n: An\norgan\nthat makes lymphocytes, stores\nred blood cells\nand lymphocytes, filters the\nblood\n, and destroys old blood cells. The spleen is  on the left side of the abdomen near the\nstomach\n.\nThymus\n: An organ in which T lymphocytes mature and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the\nbreastbone\n.\nTonsils\n: Two small masses of lymph\ntissue\nat the back of the\nthroat\n. There is one tonsil on each side of the throat.\nBone marrow\n: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of certain bones, such as the hip bone and breastbone. White blood cells, red blood cells, and\nplatelets\nare made in the bone marrow.\nEnlarge\nThe lymph system is part of the body's immune system and is made up of tissues and organs that help protect the body from infection and disease. These include the tonsils, thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes. Lymph (clear, watery fluid) and lymphocytes (white blood cells) travel through the lymph vessels and into the lymph nodes where the lymphocytes destroy harmful substances. The lymph enters the bloodstream through a large vein near the heart.\nLymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach,\nthyroid gland\n,\nbrain,\nand skin.\nNon-Hodgkin\nlymphoma\ncan begin in B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, or natural killer cells.\nThere are two general types of lymphomas:\nHodgkin lymphoma\nand non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This summary is about the treatment of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. For information about the treatment of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma, see\nChildhood Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment\n.\nTreatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is different for children and adults.\n\t\t  For information about treatment of adults, see the following:\nAdult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\nPrimary CNS Lymphoma Treatment\nMycosis Fungoides (Including Sezary Syndrome) Treatment\nThere are three major types of childhood non-Hodgkin\n\t\t  lymphoma.\nThe type of lymphoma is determined by how the cells look\n\t\t  under a\nmicroscope\n. The three major types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n\t\t  are:\nAggressive mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nAggressive\nmature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas include:\nBurkitt lymphoma/leukemia:\nBurkitt lymphoma\nand\nBurkitt leukemia\nare different  forms of the same disease. Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia is an aggressive (fast-growing)\ndisorder\nof B lymphocytes that is most common in children and young adults. It may form in the abdomen,\nWaldeyer's ring\n,\ntesticles\n, bone, bone marrow, skin,\ncentral nervous system\n(CNS), or head and neck.  Burkitt leukemia may  start in the lymph nodes as Burkitt lymphoma and then spread to the blood and bone marrow, or it may start in the blood and bone marrow without forming in  the lymph nodes first.\nBoth Burkitt leukemia and Burkitt lymphoma have been linked to infection with the\nEpstein-Barr virus\n(EBV), although EBV infection is more likely to occur in patients in Africa than in the United States. Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia is more common in White people. Burkitt  lymphoma/leukemia  is\ndiagnosed\nwhen a sample of tissue is checked and a certain change to the\nMYC\ngene\nis found.\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\n:\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that grows quickly in the lymph nodes. The spleen,\nliver\n, bone marrow, or other organs are also often affected. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma occurs more often in\nadolescents\nthan in children.\nPrimary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma\n:\nA type of lymphoma that develops from B cells in the mediastinum (the area between the lungs). It may spread to nearby organs including the lungs and the sac around the heart. It may also spread to lymph nodes and distant organs including the\nkidneys\n. Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma occurs more often in older adolescents than in children.\nLymphoblastic lymphoma\nLymphoblastic lymphoma\nis a type of lymphoma that mainly affects T-cell lymphocytes.     It usually forms in the mediastinum (the area between the lungs). This causes trouble breathing, wheezing, trouble swallowing, or swelling of the head and neck.  It may spread to lymph nodes, bone, bone marrow, skin, the CNS, abdominal organs, and other areas.   Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a lot like\nacute lymphoblastic leukemia\n(ALL).\nAnaplastic large cell lymphoma\nAnaplastic large cell lymphoma\nis a type of lymphoma that mainly affects T-cell lymphocytes. It usually forms in the  lymph nodes, skin, or bone,  and sometimes forms in the\ngastrointestinal tract\n, lung, tissue that covers the lungs, and muscle.   Patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma have a\nreceptor\n, called CD30, on the surface of their T cells. In many children, anaplastic large cell lymphoma is marked by changes in the\nALK\ngene that makes a\nprotein\ncalled\nanaplastic lymphoma kinase\n. A\npathologist\nchecks for these cell and gene changes  to help diagnose anaplastic large cell lymphoma.\nSome types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma         are rare in children.\nSome types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma are less common. These include:\nPediatric-type\nfollicular lymphoma\n: In children, follicular lymphoma occurs mainly in  males. It is more likely to be found in one area and does not spread to other places in the body. It usually forms in the tonsils and lymph nodes in the neck, but may also form in the testicles, kidney,\ngastrointestinal tract\n, and\nsalivary gland\n.\nMarginal zone lymphoma\n: Marginal zone lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that tends to grow and spread slowly and is usually found at an early\nstage.\nIt may be found in the lymph nodes or in areas outside the lymph nodes. Marginal zone lymphoma found outside the lymph nodes in children is called\nmucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma\n. MALT may be linked to\nHelicobacter pylori\ninfection of the gastrointestinal tract and\nChlamydophila psittaci\ninfection of the\nconjunctival membrane\nwhich lines the eye. Marginal zone lymphoma is rare in children but common in adults.\nPrimary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma\n: Primary CNS lymphoma is extremely rare in children.\nPeripheral T-cell lymphoma\n: Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is an aggressive (fast-growing) non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins in mature T lymphocytes. Other types of peripheral T-cell lymphoma include mature T-cell/natural killer-cell lymphoma,\nextranodal\nNK/T-cell lymphoma, and gamma-delta hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is rare in children.\nCutaneous T-cell lymphoma\n: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma begins in the skin and can cause the skin to thicken or form a\ntumor\n. It is very rare in children but is more common in adolescents and young adults. There are different types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, such as cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma,\nsubcutaneous\npanniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma, and\nmycosis fungoides\n. Mycosis fungoides rarely occurs in children and adolescents.\nHaving a weakened immune system increases the risk of NHL in children.\nAnything that increases a person's risk of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Not every child with one or more of these risk factors will develop NHL, and it will develop in some children who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.\nSome of the types of immune system problems that have been linked with a higher risk of childhood NHL include the following:\nBeing infected with the Epstein-Barr virus or\nhuman immunodeficiency virus\n(HIV).\nHaving a weakened immune system after a\ntransplant\nor from\nmedicines\ngiven after a transplant.\nHaving certain\ninherited\ndiseases (such as\nDNA repair defect syndromes\nwhich include\nataxia-telangiectasia\n,\nNijmegen breakage syndrome\n, and\nconstitutional\nmismatch repair deficiency\n).\nPast treatment for cancer.\nIf lymphoma or\nlymphoproliferative disease\nis linked to a weakened immune system from certain inherited diseases, HIV infection, a transplant or medicines given after a transplant, the\ncondition\nis called lymphoproliferative disease associated with\nimmunodeficiency\n. The different types of lymphoproliferative disease associated with immunodeficiency include:\nLymphoproliferative disease associated with primary immunodeficiency.\nHIV-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nPost-transplant lymphoproliferative disease\n.\nLymphoproliferative disease from chemotherapy.\nSigns of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma include\n\t\t  breathing problems and swollen lymph nodes.\nThese and other\nsigns\nmay be caused by childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma or by other conditions. Check with a doctor if your child has any of the following:\nTrouble breathing.\nWheezing.\nCoughing.\nHigh-pitched breathing sounds.\nSwelling of the head, neck, upper body, or arms.\nTrouble swallowing.\nPainless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, underarm,\n\t\t\t stomach, or\ngroin\n.\nPainless lump or swelling in a testicle.\nFever\nfor no known reason.\nWeight loss for no known reason.\nDrenching\nnight sweats\n.\nPain or swelling in the abdomen.\nTests that examine the body and lymph system are used to diagnose childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nIn addition to asking about your child's\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your child's doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body, including\nelectrolytes\n,\nlactate dehydrogenase\n(LDH),\nuric acid\n,\nblood urea nitrogen\n(BUN),\ncreatinine\n, and liver function values. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nLiver function tests\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher-than-normal amount of a substance can be a sign of cancer.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography,\ncomputerized tomography\n, or computerized axial tomography.\nEnlarge\nComputed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor cells in the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.\nEnlarge\nPositron emission tomography (PET) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the PET scanner. The head rest and white strap help the child lie still.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the child's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body.  Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n:  A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.   This procedure is also called\nnuclear magnetic resonance imaging\n(NMRI).\nEnlarge\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.\nLumbar puncture\n: A procedure used to collect\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) from the\nspinal column\n. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the\nspine\nand into the CSF around the\nspinal cord\nand removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or\nspinal tap\n.\nEnlarge\nLumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.\nChest x-ray\n: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nUltrasound\nexam\n:  A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n.\nEnlarge\nAbdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound transducer connected to a computer is pressed against the skin of the abdomen. The transducer bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nA biopsy is done to diagnose childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nCells and tissues are removed during a\nbiopsy\nso they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for cancer cells. Because treatment depends on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, biopsy samples should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nOne of the following  types of biopsies  may be done:\nExcisional\n\t\t\t\t  biopsy\n: The removal of an entire lymph node or lump of tissue.\nIncisional\n\t\t\t\t  biopsy\n: The removal of part of a lump, lymph node, or sample of tissue.\nCore needle biopsy\n: The removal of tissue or part of a lymph node using a wide needle.\nFine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy\n:\n\t\t\t\t  The removal of tissue or part of a lymph node using a thin needle.\nThe procedure used to remove the sample of tissue depends on where the tumor is in the body:\nBone marrow aspiration\nand biopsy\n:  The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child\u2019s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.\nMediastinoscopy\n: A\nsurgical\nprocedure to look at the organs, tissues, and lymph nodes between the lungs for\nabnormal\nareas.  An\nincision\n(cut) is made at the top of the breastbone and a\nmediastinoscope\nis inserted into the chest.  A mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It also has a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.\nAnterior mediastinotomy\n: A surgical procedure to look at the organs and tissues between the lungs and between the breastbone and heart for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made next to the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest.  A mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It also has a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This is also called the\nChamberlain procedure\n.\nThoracentesis\n: The removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung, using a needle. A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.\nIf cancer is found, the following tests may be done to study the cancer cells:\nImmunohistochemistry\n:  A\nlaboratory test\nthat uses antibodies to check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient\u2019s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nFlow cytometry\n: A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of the cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor (or other)\nmarkers\non the cell surface. The cells from a sample of a patient\u2019s blood, bone marrow, or other tissue are stained with a fluorescent dye, placed in a fluid, and then passed one at a time through a beam of light. The test results are based on how the cells that were stained with the fluorescent dye react to the beam of light. This test is used to help diagnose and manage certain types of cancers, such as\nleukemia\nand lymphoma.\nCytogenetic\nanalysis\n: A laboratory test in which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nFISH\n(fluorescence in situ hybridization)\n: A laboratory test used to look at and count genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of\nDNA\nthat contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient\u2019s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.\nImmunophenotyping\n: A laboratory test that uses antibodies to identify cancer cells based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of lymphoma.\nCertain factors affect  prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on:\nThe type of lymphoma.\nWhere the tumor is in the body when the tumor is diagnosed.\nThe\n\t\t  stage of the cancer.\nWhether there are certain changes in the chromosomes.\nThe type of initial treatment.\nWhether the lymphoma responded to initial treatment.\nThe patient\u2019s age and general health.\nStages of Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\nKey Points\nAfter childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed,\n\t\t  tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system\n\t\t  or to other parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nThe following stages are used for childhood non-Hodgkin\n\t\t  lymphoma:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nSometimes childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma does not respond to treatment or recurs (comes back) after treatment.\nAfter childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed,\n\t\t  tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system\n\t\t  or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread within the\nlymph system\nor to other parts of\n\t\t  the body is called\nstaging\n. The results of tests and procedures used to\ndiagnose\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nmay also be used for staging. The\n\t\t  information gathered from the staging process determines the\nstage\nof the\n\t\t  disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan  treatment.\nFor a description of the tests and procedures used to diagnose non-Hodgkin lymphoma, see\nGeneral Information\n.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for childhood non-Hodgkin\n\t\t  lymphoma:\nStage I\nEnlarge\nStage I childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer is found in one group of lymph nodes or one area outside the lymph nodes, but no cancer is found in the abdomen or mediastinum (area between the lungs).\nIn\nstage I childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n, cancer is found:\nin one group of\nlymph nodes\n; or\nin one area outside the lymph nodes.\nNo cancer is found in the\nabdomen\nor\nmediastinum\n(area between the\nlungs\n).\nStage II\nEnlarge\nStage II childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer is found in one area outside the lymph nodes and in nearby lymph nodes (a); or in two or more areas above (b) or below (c) the diaphragm; or cancer started in the stomach, appendix, or intestines (d) and can be removed by surgery.\nIn\nstage II childhood non-Hodgkin\n\t\t\t lymphoma\n, cancer is found:\nin one area outside the\nlymph nodes\nand in nearby lymph nodes; or\nin two or more areas either above or below the\ndiaphragm\n, and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes; or\nto have started in the\nstomach\nor\nintestines\nand can be completely removed by\nsurgery\n. Cancer may have spread to certain nearby lymph nodes.\nStage III\nEnlarge\nStage III childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer is found in at least one area above and below the diaphragm (a); or cancer started in the chest (b); or cancer started in the abdomen and spread throughout the abdomen (c); or in the area around the spine (not shown).\nIn\nstage III\n\t\t\t childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n, cancer is found:\nin at least one area above the\ndiaphragm\nand in at least one area below the diaphragm; or\nto have started in the chest; or\nto have started in the\nabdomen\nand spread throughout the abdomen and cannot be completely removed by\nsurgery\n; or\nin the area around the\nspine\n.\nStage IV\nEnlarge\nStage IV childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer is found in the bone marrow, brain, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Cancer may also be found in other parts of the body.\nIn\nstage IV childhood\n\t\t\t non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n, cancer is found in the\nbone marrow\n,\nbrain\n, or\ncerebrospinal fluid\n. Cancer may also be found in other parts of the body.\nSometimes childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma does not respond to treatment or recurs (comes back) after treatment.\nRefractory\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma is cancer that does not respond to initial treatment.\nRecurrent\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma is cancer that has come back after treatment. It may come\n\t\tback in the\nlymph system\nor in other parts of the body.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for children with\n\t\t  non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nChildren with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their\n\t\t  treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood\n\t\t  cancer.\nEight types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nTargeted therapy\nOther drug therapy\nPhototherapy\nWatchful waiting\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nImmunotherapy\nTreatment for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for children with\n\t\t  non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for children with\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma\n. Some\n\t\t  treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being\n\t\t  tested in\nclinical trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve\n\t\t  current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.\nTaking part in a clinical trial\n\t\t  should be considered for all children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.         Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nChildren with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their\n\t\t  treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood\n\t\t  cancer.\nTreatment will be overseen by a\npediatric oncologist\n, a doctor who specializes\n\t\t  in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other\nhealth care providers\nwho are experts in treating children\n\t\t  with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of\nmedicine\n.\n\t\t  These may include the following\nspecialists\n:\nPediatrician\n.\nRadiation\n\t\t\t oncologist\n.\nPediatric hematologist\n.\nPediatric surgeon\n.\nPediatric nurse specialist\n.\nRehabilitation specialist\n.\nPsychologist\n.\nSocial worker\n.\nEight types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery\nmay be done to remove as much of the\ntumor\nas possible for some types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of surgery, patients may be given\nchemotherapy\nto kill any cancer\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.      When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(\nintrathecal chemotherapy\n), an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the\nabdomen\n, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas.\nCombination chemotherapy\nis treatment using two or more anticancer drugs.\nIntrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat\n\t\t\t childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has spread, or may spread,  to the\nbrain\n. When used to lessen the chance cancer will spread to the brain,  it is called\nCNS prophylaxis\n. Intrathecal chemotherapy is given in addition to chemotherapy by mouth or vein.\n\nHigher than usual\ndoses\nof chemotherapy may also be used as CNS prophylaxis.\nEnlarge\nIntrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.\nThe way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and\nstage\nof the cancer being treated.\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses high energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. External radiation therapy may be used to treat childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has spread, or may spread, to the brain and\nspinal cord\n. External radiation therapy may also be used to treat\ncutaneous T-cell lymphoma\n(\nmycosis fungoides\n).\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nHigh doses of chemotherapy\nare given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including\nblood\n-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell transplant\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient or a\ndonor\nand are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\n.\nEnlarge\nDonor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nuses drugs or other substances to block the action of specific enzymes, proteins, or other molecules involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. Types of targeted therapy include the following:\nMonoclonal antibody\ntherapy: Monoclonal antibodies are\nimmune system\nproteins\nmade in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these antibodies can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or\nradioactive\nmaterial directly to cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies may be used in combination with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy.\nTypes of monoclonal antibodies include:\nRituximab\nis used to treat several types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nPembrolizumab\nis used to treat\nprimary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma\nthat  has not\nresponded\nto treatment or has\nrecurred\n(come back). Treatment with pembrolizumab has been mostly studied in adults.\nBrentuximab vedotin\nis a monoclonal antibody combined with an anticancer drug that is used to treat\nanaplastic large cell lymphoma\nthat has not responded to treatment or has recurred.\nA\nbispecific monoclonal antibody\nis made up of two different monoclonal antibodies that bind to two different substances and kills cancer cells. Bispecific monoclonal\nantibody therapy\nis used in the treatment of Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia and\ndiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nthat have not responded to treatment or have recurred.\nNivolumab\nis being studied in the treatment of anaplastic large cell lymphoma with a certain\ngene\nchange that has not responded to treatment or has recurred.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body\u2019s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nALK inhibitor\ntherapy: ALK inhibitors block the activity of a protein called\nanaplastic lymphoma kinase\n. Blocking this protein may help keep cancer cells from growing and spreading.\nCrizotinib\n,\nalectinib\n, and\nceritinib\nmay be used to treat anaplastic large cell lymphoma that has not responded to treatment or has recurred. Crizotinib is also being studied in the treatment of newly\ndiagnosed\nanaplastic large cell lymphoma.\nProteasome inhibitor\ntherapy: This treatment blocks the actions of proteasomes in cancer cells. Proteasomes remove proteins no longer needed by the cell. When the proteasomes are blocked, the\nprotons\nbuild up in the cell and may cause the cancer cell to die.\nBortezomib\nmay be used to treat lymphoblastic lymphoma that has not responded to treatment or has recurred.\nImmunotoxins\n: This treatment can bind to cancer cells and kill them.\nDenileukin diftitox\nis an immunotoxin used to treat\ncutaneous T-cell lymphoma\n.\nOther targeted therapies are being studied for the treatment of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has  not responded to treatment or has recurred (come back).\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\n.\nOther drug therapy\nRetinoids\nare drugs related to\nvitamin A\n. Retinoid therapy with\nbexarotene\nis used to treat several types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\nSteroids\nare\nhormones\nmade naturally in the body. They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs. Steroid therapy that is applied to the skin is used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\nDexamethasone\nand\nprednisone\nare steroids used with other drugs to treat certain types of lymphoma.\nAntibiotics\nare drugs used to treat\ninfections\nand cancer caused by\nbacteria\nor other\nmicroorganisms\n. Antibiotics have been used to treat\nmucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma\n. Treatment with antibiotic therapy has been mostly studied in adults.\nPhototherapy\nPhototherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of\nlaser\nlight to kill cancer cells. A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein. The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells. For\nskin cancer\nin the skin, laser light is shined onto the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells. Phototherapy is used in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\nWatchful waiting\nWatchful waiting\nis closely\nmonitoring\na patient's\ncondition\nwithout giving any treatment until\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nappear or change.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nhelps a person's immune system fight cancer. Types of immunotherapy include:\nCAR T-cell therapy\n: This treatment changes the patient's\nT cells\n(a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special\nreceptors\nare added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called\nchimeric antigen receptor\n(CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma   that has not responded to treatment or has recurred (come back).\nEnlarge\nCAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient\u2019s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient\u2019s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.\nEpstein-Barr virus\n(EBV)-specific\ncytotoxic T-lymphocytes\nare a type of\nimmune cell\nthat can kill certain cells, including foreign cells, cancer cells, and cells infected with the EBV. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes can be separated from other blood cells, grown in the laboratory, and then given to the patient to kill cancer cells. EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are being studied to treat\npost-transplant lymphoproliferative disease\n.\nCyclosporine A\n: This treatment is used in combination with steroids to treat subcutaneous panniculitic T-cell lymphoma.\nTreatment for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSide effects\nfrom cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called\nlate effects\n. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:\nPhysical problems, including problems with the heart, bones, and\nfertility\n.\nChanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.\nSecond cancers\n(new types of cancer), such as\nbrain tumors\n,\nacute myeloid leukemia\n, and\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\n.\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. For more information, see\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\n.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment Options for Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\nIn This Section\nBurkitt lymphoma/leukemia\nTreatment of Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia\nTreatment of recurrent or refractory Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nTreatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nTreatment of recurrent or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nPrimary Mediastinal B-cell Lymphoma\nTreatment of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma\nTreatment of recurrent or refractory primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma\nLymphoblastic Lymphoma\nTreatment of lymphoblastic lymphoma\nTreatment of recurrent or refractory lymphoblastic lymphoma\nAnaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma\nTreatment of anaplastic large cell lymphoma\nTreatment of recurrent or refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma\nLymphoproliferative Disease Associated With Immunodeficiency in Children\nTreatment of lymphoproliferative disease associated with primary immunodeficiency\nTreatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma associated with DNA repair defect syndromes\nTreatment of HIV-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nTreatment of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease\nRare NHL Occurring in Children\nTreatment of pediatric-type follicular lymphoma\nTreatment of marginal zone lymphoma\nTreatment of primary CNS lymphoma\nTreatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma\nTreatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma\nTreatment of mycosis fungoides\nBurkitt lymphoma/leukemia\nTreatment of Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see\nTreatment Option Overview\n.\nTreatment of newly\ndiagnosed\nBurkitt lymphoma\n/\nleukemia\nmay include:\nSurgery\nto remove as much of the\ntumor\nas possible,  followed by\ncombination chemotherapy\n.\nCombination chemotherapy with or without\ntargeted therapy\n(\nrituximab\n).\nTreatment of recurrent or refractory Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see\nTreatment Option Overview\n.\nTreatment of\nrecurrent\nor\nrefractory\nBurkitt lymphoma\n/\nleukemia\nmay include:\nCombination chemotherapy\nwith or without\ntargeted therapy\n(\nrituximab\n).\nTargeted therapy (rituximab), combination chemotherapy, and\ndexamethasone\n.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy\nwith\nstem cell transplant\nwith the patient's own\ncells\nor cells from a\ndonor\n.\nTargeted therapy with a\nbispecific antibody\n.\nCAR T-cell therapy\n.\nA\nclinical trial\nthat checks a sample of the patient's\ntumor\nfor certain\ngene\nchanges.

        "question": "Who is at risk for Prostate Cancer? ?",
        "right_answer": "Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.\n                    Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.\n                \n                \n                    The following risk factors may increase the risk of prostate cancer:\n                    Age      Prostate cancer is rare in men younger than 50 years of age. The chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older.       Family history of prostate cancer     A man whose father, brother, or son has had prostate cancer has a higher-than-average risk of prostate cancer.       Race     Prostate cancer occurs more often in African-American men than in white men. African-American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer.       Hormones    The prostate needs male hormones to work the way it should. The main male sex hormone is testosterone. Testosterone helps the body develop and maintain male sex characteristics.    Testosterone is changed into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by an enzyme in the body. DHT is important for normal prostate growth but can also cause the prostate to get bigger and may play a part in the development of prostate cancer.       Vitamin E    The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) found that vitamin E taken alone increased the risk of prostate cancer. The risk continued even after the men stopped taking vitamin E.       Folic acid    Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid. However, the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets.       Dairy and calcium    A diet high in dairy foods and calcium may cause a small increase in the risk of prostate cancer.\n                \n                \n                    The following protective factors may decrease the risk of prostate cancer:\n                    Folate    Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets. However, the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid.       Finasteride and Dutasteride     Finasteride and dutasteride are drugs used to lower the amount of male sex hormones made by the body. These drugs block the enzyme that changes testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Higher than normal levels of DHT may play a part in developing prostate cancer. Taking finasteride or dutasteride has been shown to lower the risk for prostate cancer, but it is not known if these drugs lower the risk of death from prostate cancer.    The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) studied whether the drug finasteride can prevent prostate cancer in healthy men 55 years of age and older. This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men that took finasteride compared with the group of men that did not. Also, the men who took finasteride who did have prostate cancer had more aggressive tumors. The number of deaths from prostate cancer was the same in both groups. Men who took finasteride reported more side effects compared with the group of men that did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, and enlarged breasts.    The Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events Trial (REDUCE) studied whether the drug dutasteride can prevent prostate cancer in men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk for the disease. This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men who took dutasteride compared with the group of men that did not. The number of less aggressive prostate cancers was lower, but the number of more aggressive prostate cancers was not. Men who took dutasteride reported more side effects than men who did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, less semen, and gynecomastia (enlarged breasts).\n                \n                \n                    The following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known:\n                    Selenium and vitamin E    The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) studied whether taking vitamin E and selenium (a mineral) will prevent prostate cancer. The selenium and vitamin E were taken separately or together by healthy men 55 years of age and older (50 years of age and older for African-American men). The study showed that taking selenium alone or selenium and vitamin E together did not decrease the risk of prostate cancer.       Diet    It is not known if decreasing fat or increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet helps decrease the risk of prostate cancer or death from prostate cancer. In the PCPT trial, certain fatty acids increased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer while others decreased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer.       Multivitamins    Regular use of multivitamins has not been proven to increase the risk of early or localized prostate cancer. However, a large study showed an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer among men who took multivitamins more than seven times a week.       Lycopene    Some studies have shown that a diet high in lycopene may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but other studies have not. It has not been proven that taking lycopene supplements decreases the risk of prostate cancer.",

The testicles are held within the scrotum by the spermatic cord. The spermatic cord also contains the vas deferens and vessels and nerves of the testicles.     The testicles are the male sex glands and make testosterone and sperm. Germ cells in the testicles make immature sperm. These sperm travel through a network of tubules (tiny tubes) and larger tubes into the epididymis (a long coiled tube next to the testicles). This is where the sperm mature and are stored.

Screening tests are given when you have no cancer symptoms.\nIf a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called\ndiagnostic tests\n.\nGeneral Information About Testicular Cancer\nKey Points\nTesticular cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of one or both testicles.\nTesticular cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men aged 20 to 39 years.\nTesticular cancer  can usually be cured.\nA condition called cryptorchidism  (an undescended testicle) is a risk factor for  testicular cancer.\nTesticular cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of one or both testicles.\nThe\ntesticles\nare 2 egg-shaped\nglands\ninside the\nscrotum\n(a sac of loose skin that lies\ndirectly below the\npenis\n). The testicles are held within the scrotum by the\nspermatic cord\n. The spermatic cord also contains the\nvas deferens\nand vessels and\nnerves\nof the testicles.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the  male reproductive and urinary systems, showing the testicles, prostate, bladder, and other organs.\nThe testicles are the male sex glands and  make\ntestosterone\nand\nsperm\n.\nGerm cells\nin the testicles make immature sperm. These sperm travel through a network of tubules (tiny tubes) and  larger tubes into the\nepididymis\n(a long coiled tube next to the testicles). This is where the sperm mature and are stored.\nAlmost all\ntesticular cancers\nstart in the germ cells. The two main types of\ntesticular germ cell tumors\nare\nseminomas\nand\nnonseminomas\n.\nFor more information, see\nTesticular Cancer Treatment\n.\nTesticular cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men aged 20 to 39 years.\nTesticular cancer is very rare, but it is the most common\ncancer\nfound in men between the ages of 20 to 39 years, with  the highest rates in the age group of  25 to 34 years.  The racial and ethnic groups with the highest   rates of testicular cancer include  non-Hispanic White men, non-Hispanic American Indian men, and  Alaskan Native men.\nTesticular cancer  can usually be cured.\nAlthough the number of new cases of testicular cancer has doubled in the last 40 years,\nthe number of deaths caused by testicular cancer has decreased greatly because of better   treatments. Testicular cancer can usually be\ncured\n, even in\nlate stages\nof the disease. (See the\nPDQ\nsummary on\nTesticular Cancer Treatment\nfor more information.)\nA condition called cryptorchidism  (an undescended testicle) is a risk factor for  testicular cancer.\nAnything that increases the chance of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for testicular cancer include the following:\nHaving\ncryptorchidism\n(an undescended testicle).\nHaving a  testicle that is not normal, such as a small testicle that does not work the way it should.\nHaving testicular\ncarcinoma in situ\n.\nBeing a White man.\nHaving a\npersonal\nor\nfamily history\nof testicular cancer.\nHaving\nKlinefelter syndrome\n.\nMen who have cryptorchidism, a testicle that is not  normal, or testicular carcinoma in situ have an increased risk of testicular cancer in one or both testicles, and need to be followed closely.\nTesticular Cancer Screening\nKey Points\nTests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.\nThere is no standard or routine screening test  for testicular cancer.\nScreening tests for testicular cancer are being studied in clinical trials.\nTests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.\nScientists\nstudy\nscreening\ntests to find those with the fewest harms and most benefits. Cancer screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes\nsymptoms\n) helps a person live longer or decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, the chance of\nrecovery\nis better if the disease is found and treated at an early\nstage\n.\nThere is no standard or routine screening test  for testicular cancer.\nThere is no standard or routine screening test used for early detection of\ntesticular cancer\n. Most often, testicular cancer is first found by men themselves, either by chance or during self-exam. Sometimes the cancer is found by a doctor during a routine\nphysical exam\n.\nNo studies have been done to find out if\ntesticular\nself-exams,  regular exams by a doctor, or other screening tests in men with no symptoms would  decrease the risk of dying from this disease. However, routine screening  probably would not decrease the risk of dying from testicular cancer. This is partly because testicular cancer can usually be\ncured\nat any stage. Finding  testicular cancer early may make it easier to treat. Patients who are\ndiagnosed\nwith testicular cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body may need less\nchemotherapy\nand\nsurgery\n, resulting in   fewer\nside effects\n.\nIf a lump is found in the\ntesticle\nby the patient or during a routine physical exam, tests may be done to check for cancer. Some tests have risks, and may cause\nanxiety\n.\nScreening tests for testicular cancer are being studied in clinical trials.\nInformation about\nclinical trials\nsupported by\nNCI\ncan be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nAbout This PDQ Summary\nAbout PDQ\nPhysician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in\nSpanish\n.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government\u2019s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about testicular cancer screening.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the\nPDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board\n.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at\nNCI's website\n.

        "context": "Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma\nKey Points\nIntraocular melanoma is a disease in which malignant\n\t\t  (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the eye.\nBeing older and having fair skin may increase the risk of intraocular melanoma.\nSigns and symptoms of intraocular melanoma may include blurred vision or a dark\n\t\t  spot on the iris.\nTests that examine the eye are used to diagnose intraocular melanoma.\nA biopsy of the tumor is rarely needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nIntraocular melanoma is a disease in which malignant\n\t\t  (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the eye.\nIntraocular melanoma\nbegins in the middle of three layers of the wall of the eye. The outer layer  includes the white\nsclera\n(the \"white of the eye\") and the clear\ncornea\nat the front of the eye. The inner layer  has a lining of\nnerve\ntissue\n, called the\nretina\n,  which senses light and sends images along the\noptic nerve\nto the\nbrain\n.\nThe middle layer, where intraocular melanoma forms, is called  the\nuvea\nor uveal tract, and has three main parts:\nIris\nThe\niris\nis the colored area at the front of the eye (the \"eye color\"). It can be seen through the clear cornea. The\npupil\nis in the center of the iris, and it changes size to let more or less light into the eye. Intraocular melanoma of the iris is usually a small\ntumor\nthat grows slowly and rarely spreads to other parts of the body.\nCiliary body\nThe\nciliary body\nis a ring of tissue with muscle\nfibers\nthat change the shape of  the\nlens\n. It is found behind the iris. Changes in the shape of the lens help the eye  focus. The ciliary body also makes the clear fluid that fills the space between the cornea and the iris. Intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris.\nChoroid\nThe\nchoroid\nis a layer of\nblood vessels\nthat bring\noxygen\nand\nnutrients\nto the eye. Most intraocular melanomas begin in the choroid. Intraocular melanoma of the choroid is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the eye, showing the outside and inside of the eye including the sclera, cornea, iris, ciliary body, choroid, retina, vitreous humor, and optic nerve. The vitreous humor is a liquid that fills the center of the eye.\nIntraocular melanoma is a\nrare cancer\nthat forms from cells that make\nmelanin\nin the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. It is the most common\neye cancer\nin\n\t\t  adults.\nBeing older and having fair skin may increase the risk of intraocular melanoma.\nAnything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop intraocular melanoma, and it can develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.\nRisk factors for intraocular melanoma include the following:\nHaving a fair complexion, which includes the following:\nFair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.\nBlue or green or other light-colored eyes.\nOlder age.\nBeing White.\nSigns and symptoms of intraocular melanoma may include blurred vision or a dark\n\t\t  spot on the iris.\nIntraocular melanoma may not cause early\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\n. It is sometimes found during a regular eye exam when the doctor\ndilates\nthe pupil and looks into the eye. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by intraocular melanoma or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following symptoms that do not go away:\nBlurred vision or other change in vision.\nFloaters (spots that drift in your field of vision) or flashes of light.\nA dark spot on the iris.\nA change in the size or shape of the pupil.\nA change in the position of the eyeball in the\neye socket\n.\nTests that examine the eye are used to diagnose intraocular melanoma.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nEye exam with dilated pupil\n: An exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (enlarged)   with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the  lens and pupil to the retina. The inside of the eye, including the retina and the optic nerve, is checked. Pictures may be taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor. There are several types of eye exams:\nOphthalmoscopy\n: An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light.\nSlit-lamp biomicroscopy\n: An exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a microscope.\nGonioscopy\n: An exam of the front part of the eye between the cornea and iris.  A special instrument is used to  see if the area where fluid drains out of the eye is blocked.\nUltrasound\nexam of the eye\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes.   Eye drops are used to numb the eye, and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is  placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a picture of the inside of the eye, and the distance from the cornea to the retina is measured. The picture, called a\nsonogram\n, shows  on the screen of the ultrasound\nmonitor\n.\nHigh-resolution\nultrasound biomicroscopy\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves  (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. Eye drops are used to numb the eye, and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a more detailed picture of the inside of the eye than a regular ultrasound. The tumor is checked for its size,  shape, and thickness, and for signs that the tumor has spread to nearby tissue.\nTransillumination of the globe and iris\n: An exam of the iris, cornea, lens, and ciliary body with a light  placed on either the upper or lower   lid.\nFluorescein\nangiography\n: A procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood inside the eye.   An orange fluorescent\ndye\n(fluorescein) is\ninjected\ninto a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking.\nIndocyanine green angiography\n: A procedure to look at blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye.   A green dye (indocyanine green) is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking.\nOcular coherence\ntomography\n: An\nimaging test\nthat uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina, and sometimes the choroid, to see if there is swelling or fluid beneath the retina.\nA biopsy of the tumor is rarely needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma.\nA\nbiopsy\nis the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. Rarely, a biopsy of the tumor is needed to\ndiagnose\nintraocular melanoma. Tissue that is removed during a biopsy or surgery to remove the tumor may be tested to get more information about\nprognosis\nand  which treatment options are best.\nThe following tests may be done on the sample of tissue:\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nGene expression profiling\n: A laboratory test that identifies all of the\ngenes\nin a cell or tissue that are making (expressing)\nmessenger RNA\n. Messenger RNA\nmolecules\ncarry the\ngenetic\ninformation that is needed to make\nproteins\nfrom the\nDNA\nin the cell\nnucleus\nto the protein-making machinery in the cell\ncytoplasm\n.\nA biopsy may result in retinal detachment (the retina separates from other tissues in the eye). This can be repaired by surgery.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe prognosis and treatment options depend on the following:\nHow the\nmelanoma\ncells look under a microscope.\nThe size and thickness of the tumor.\nWhether the tumor is in the\n\t\t  iris, ciliary body, or choroid part of the eye.\nWhether the tumor has spread within the eye or to\n\t\t  other places in the body.\nWhether there are certain changes in the\ngenes\nlinked to intraocular melanoma.\nThe patient's age and general health.\nWhether the tumor has\nrecurred\n(come back) after treatment.\nStages of Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma\nKey Points\nAfter intraocular melanoma has been diagnosed, tests are\n\t\t  done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts\n\t\t  of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nThe following sizes are used to describe intraocular melanoma and plan treatment:\nSmall\nMedium\nLarge\nThere is no staging system for  intraocular melanoma of the\niris\n.\nThe following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the\nciliary body and choroid\n:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nIntraocular melanoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nAfter intraocular melanoma has been diagnosed, tests are\n\t\t  done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts\n\t\t  of the body.\nThe process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease.  It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a\nsign\nof disease.\nLiver function tests\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the\nliver\n. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign the cancer has spread to the liver.\nUltrasound\nexam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the liver, and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n.\nChest x-ray\n: An\nx-ray\nof the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the liver. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest,\nabdomen\n, or\npelvis\n, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find malignant\ntumor\ncells in the body.  A very small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nIf\nintraocular melanoma\nspreads to the\noptic nerve\nor nearby tissue of the\neye socket\n, it is called\nextraocular\nextension.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  intraocular melanoma spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually intraocular melanoma cells. The disease is metastatic intraocular melanoma, not liver cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nThe following sizes are used to describe intraocular melanoma and plan treatment:\nSmall\nThe tumor is 5 to 16\nmillimeters\nin\ndiameter\nand \n\t\t\t\tfrom 1 to  3 millimeters thick.\nEnlarge\nMillimeters (mm). A sharp pencil point is about 1 mm, a new crayon point is about 2 mm, and a new pencil eraser is about 5 mm.\nMedium\nThe\n\t\t\t\ttumor is 16 millimeters or smaller in diameter and\n\t\t\t\t from  3.1 to 8 millimeters thick.\nLarge\nThe tumor is:\nmore than 8 millimeters thick and any diameter; or\nat least 2 millimeters thick and more than 16 millimeters in diameter.\nThough most intraocular melanoma tumors are raised, some are flat. These\ndiffuse\ntumors grow widely across the\nuvea\n.\nThere is no staging system for  intraocular melanoma of the\niris\n.\nThe following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the\nciliary body and choroid\n:\nIntraocular melanoma\nof the\nciliary body\nand\nchoroid\nhas four size categories. The category depends on how wide and thick the\ntumor\nis.

The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is more than 5 millimeters thick.\nStage IV\nIn\nstage IV\n, the\ntumor\nmay be any size and has spread:\nto one or more nearby\nlymph nodes\nor to the eye socket separate from the\nprimary tumor\n; or\nto other parts of the body, such as the\nliver\n,\nlung\n, bone,\nbrain\n, or tissue under the skin.\nIntraocular melanoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nThe melanoma may come back in the eye or in other parts of the body.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with\n\t\t  intraocular melanoma.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nWatchful\n\t\t\t Waiting\nRadiation therapy\nPhotocoagulation\nThermotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for intraocular (uveal) melanoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with\n\t\t  intraocular melanoma.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\nintraocular melanoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used\n\t\t  treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical\n\t\t  trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch\n\t\t  study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new\n\t\t  treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new\n\t\t  treatment is better than the standard\n\t\t  treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery is the most common treatment for intraocular melanoma. The following types of surgery may be used:\nResection: Surgery to remove the\ntumor\nand a small amount of healthy tissue around it.\nEnucleation: Surgery to remove  the eye  and part of the\noptic nerve\n. This is done if vision cannot be saved and the tumor is large, has spread to the optic nerve, or causes high pressure inside the eye. After surgery, the patient is usually fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye.\nExenteration: Surgery to remove the eye and eyelid, and\n\t\t\t\tmuscles,\nnerves\n, and fat in the\neye socket\n. After surgery, the patient may be fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye or a facial\nprosthesis\n.\nWatchful\n\t\t\t Waiting\nWatchful waiting\nis closely\nmonitoring\na patient\u2019s condition without giving any treatment until\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nappear or change. Pictures are taken over\n\t\t\t time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor  and how fast it is growing.\nWatchful waiting is used for patients who do not have signs or symptoms, and the tumor is not growing. It is also used when the tumor is in the only eye with useful vision.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer\ncells\nor keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.  Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:\nCharged-particle external-beam radiation therapy\nis a type of external-beam radiation therapy.  A special radiation therapy machine aims tiny, invisible particles, called\nprotons\nor helium\nions\n, at the cancer cells to kill them with little damage to nearby normal tissues. Charged-particle radiation therapy uses a different type of radiation than the x-ray type of radiation therapy.\nGamma Knife therapy\nis a type of\nstereotactic radiosurgery\nused for some\nmelanomas\n. This treatment can be given in one treatment. It aims tightly focused\ngamma rays\ndirectly at the tumor so there is little damage to healthy tissue. Gamma Knife therapy does not use a knife to remove the tumor and is not an operation.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer.  Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging healthy tissue. This type of internal radiation therapy may include the following:\nLocalized\nplaque radiation therapy\nis a type of internal radiation therapy that may be used for tumors of the eye. Radioactive seeds are attached to one side of a disk, called a plaque, and placed directly on the outside wall of the \n eye near the tumor.  The \n side of the plaque with the seeds on it faces the eyeball, aiming radiation at the tumor. The plaque helps  protect other nearby tissue from the radiation.\nEnlarge\nPlaque radiotherapy of the eye.  A type of radiation therapy used to treat eye tumors. Radioactive seeds are placed on one side of a thin piece of metal (usually gold) called a plaque.  The plaque is sewn onto the outside wall of the eye.  The seeds give off radiation which kills the cancer. The plaque is removed at the end of treatment, which usually lasts for several days.\nThe way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and\nstage\nof the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat intraocular melanoma.\nPhotocoagulation\nPhotocoagulation is a procedure that uses\nlaser\nlight  to destroy\nblood vessels\nthat bring\nnutrients\nto the tumor, causing the tumor cells to die. Photocoagulation may be used to treat small tumors. This is also called light coagulation.\nThermotherapy\nThermotherapy is the use of  heat from a laser to destroy cancer cells and shrink the tumor.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nInformation about  clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for intraocular (uveal) melanoma may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma\nIn This Section\nIris Melanoma\nCiliary Body Melanoma\nChoroid Melanoma\nExtraocular Extension Melanoma and Metastatic Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma\nRecurrent Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nIris Melanoma\nTreatment of\niris\nmelanoma\nmay include the following:\nWatchful waiting\n.\nSurgery (\nresection\nor\nenucleation\n).\nPlaque radiation therapy\n, for\ntumors\nthat cannot be removed by surgery.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "question": "What is the outlook for Anal Cancer ?",
        "right_answer": "Certain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - The size of the tumor.    -  Where the tumor is in the anus.    - Whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.        The treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer.    -  Where the tumor is in the anus.    - Whether the patient has human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).    - Whether cancer remains after initial treatment or has recurred.",
        "context": "Anal Cancer Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Anal Cancer\nKey Points\nAnal cancer is a type of cancer that forms in\n\t\t  the tissues of the anus.\nMost anal cancers are related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.\nSigns of anal cancer include bleeding from the anus or rectum or a lump near the anus.\nTests that examine the rectum and anus are used to diagnose anal  cancer.\nAfter anal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the anus or to other parts of the body.\nCertain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nAnal cancer is a type of cancer that forms in\n\t\t  the tissues of the anus.\nThe anus is the end of the\nlarge intestine\n. It is where stool (solid waste) leaves the body. The anus is formed partly from the outer skin layers of the body and partly from the intestine. The anus is connected to the\nrectum\nby the anal canal, which is about 1 to 1\u00bd inches long. This area is controlled by two ring-like sphincter muscles, which contract to hold stool in and relax to allow its passage out of the body.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the lower gastrointestinal (digestive) system showing  the colon, rectum, and anus. Other organs that make up the digestive system are also shown.\nAnal cancer can start in the lining of the anal canal, called the mucosa, or in the perianal skin, the squamous cells outside of the anus that contain hair follicles and sweat glands.\nTumors\nof the perianal skin that do not involve the anal\nsphincter  are usually  treated the same as anal cancers, although local therapy (treatment directed to a limited area of skin) may be used for some.\nMost anal cancers are related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.\nRisk factors\nfor anal cancer include:\nbeing\ninfected\nwith a\nhigh-risk human papillomavirus\n(HPV), especially HPV type 16 or 18\nhaving a condition or disease that causes a weakened\nimmune system\n, such as\nHIV\nor an organ\ntransplant\nhaving a\npersonal history\nof\nvulvar\n,\nvaginal\n, or\ncervical cancers\nhaving many sexual partners\nhaving receptive anal intercourse (anal sex)\nsmoking\ncigarettes\nSigns of anal cancer include bleeding from the anus or rectum or a lump near the anus.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by anal cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have:\nbleeding from the anus or rectum\na lump near the anus\npain or pressure in the area around the anus\nitching or\ndischarge\nfrom the anus\na change in\nbowel\nhabits\nTests that examine the rectum and anus are used to diagnose anal  cancer.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nDigital rectal examination\n(DRE)\nis an exam of the anus and rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts a\nlubricated\n, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual.\nEnlarge\nDigital rectal exam (DRE). The doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum and feels the rectum, anus, and prostate (in males) to check for anything abnormal.\nAnoscopy\nis an exam of the anus and lower rectum using a short, lighted tube called an anoscope.\nProctoscopy\nis a procedure to look inside the rectum and anus to check for\nabnormal\nareas, using a proctoscope. A proctoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing the inside of the rectum and anus. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.\nEndo-anal or\nendorectal ultrasound\nis a procedure in which an\nultrasound transducer\n(probe) is inserted into the anus or rectum and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.\nBiopsy\nis the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. If an abnormal area is seen during the anoscopy, a biopsy may be done at that time.\nAfter anal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the anus or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if cancer has spread within the anus or to other\nparts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from this\nstaging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know\nthe stage in order to plan treatment. The following tests may be used in the staging process:\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\nuses a computer linked to an x-ray machine to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\nabdomen\n,\npelvis\n, or chest. The pictures are taken from different angles and are used to create 3-D views of tissues and organs.  A dye may be\ninjected\ninto a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nChest x-ray\nis an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\nis a procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\nuses a small amount of radioactive glucose that is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes pictures of where glucose is being used in the body. Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nPelvic exam\nis an exam of the\nvagina\n,\ncervix\n,\nuterus\n,\nfallopian tubes\n,\novaries\n, and\nrectum\n.    A\nspeculum\nis inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A\nPap test\nof the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower\nabdomen\nto feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.\nEnlarge\nPelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.\nSome people decide to get a second opinion.\nYou may want to get a second opinion to confirm your anal cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans. They may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another treatment approach, or provide more information about your cancer.\nLearn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion at\nFinding Cancer Care\n. You can contact\nNCI\u2019s Cancer Information Service\nvia chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor, hospital, or getting a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, visit\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor About Cancer\n.\nCertain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe prognosis depends on:\nthe size of the tumor\nwhether the cancer has spread to the\nlymph nodes\nThe treatment options depend on:\nthe\nstage\nof the cancer\nwhere the tumor  is in the anus\nwhether the person has HIV\nwhether cancer remains  after initial treatment or has recurred (come back)\nStages of Anal Cancer\nKey Points\nThe following stages are used for anal cancer:\nStage 0 (carcinoma in situ)\nStage I (also called stage 1) anal cancer\nStage II (also called stage 2) anal cancer\nStage III (also called stage 3) anal cancer\nStage IV (also called stage 4) anal cancer\nAnal cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nThe following stages are used for anal cancer:\nStage 0 (carcinoma in situ)\nIn stage 0,\nabnormal\ncells are found in the mucosa (innermost layer) of the anus. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called high-grade  intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).\nStage I (also called stage 1) anal cancer\nIn stage I,  cancer has formed and the  tumor is  2\ncentimeters\nor smaller.\nStage II (also called stage 2) anal cancer\nStage II anal cancer\nis divided into stages IIA and IIB.\nIn stage IIA, the tumor is larger than 2\ncentimeters\nbut not larger than 5 centimeters.\nIn stage IIB, the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters.\nStage III (also called stage 3) anal cancer\nStage III anal cancer is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC.\nIn stage IIIA, the tumor is 5\ncentimeters\nor smaller and has spread to\nlymph nodes\nnear the anus or\ngroin\n.\nIn stage IIIB, the tumor is any size and has spread to nearby organs, such as the\nvagina\n,\nurethra\n, or\nbladder\n. Cancer has not spread to lymph nodes.\nIn stage IIIC, the tumor is any size and may have spread to nearby organs. Cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the anus or groin.\nStage IV (also called stage 4) anal cancer\nIn stage IV, the tumor is any size. Cancer may have spread to\nlymph nodes\nor nearby organs and has spread to other parts of the body, such as the\nliver\nor\nlungs\n.\nStage IV anal cancer is also called metastatic anal cancer. Metastatic cancer happens when cancer cells travel through the\nlymphatic system\nor blood and form tumors in other parts of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if anal cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually anal cancer cells. The disease is called metastatic anal cancer, not liver cancer. Learn more in\nMetastatic Cancer: When Cancer Spreads\n.\nAnal cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nRecurrent anal cancer is cancer that has come back after it has been treated. If anal cancer comes back, it may come back in the anus or in other parts of the body, such as the liver or\n\t\tlungs. Tests will be done to help determine where the cancer has returned. The type of treatment for recurrent anal cancer will depend on where it has come back.\nLearn more in\nRecurrent Cancer: When Cancer Comes Back\n. Information to help you cope and talk with your health care team can be found in the booklet\nWhen Cancer Returns\n.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for  peoplewith anal cancer.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nRadiosensitizers\nImmunotherapy\nTreatment for anal cancer may cause side effects.\nFollow-up care may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for  peoplewith anal cancer.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for anal cancer. You and your cancer care team will work together to decide your treatment plan, which may include more than one type of treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as the stage of the cancer, your overall health, and your preferences. Your plan will include information about your cancer, the goals of treatment, your treatment options and the possible side effects, and the expected length of treatment.\nTalking with your cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect will be helpful. You\u2019ll want to learn what you need to do before treatment begins, how you\u2019ll feel while going through it, and what kind of help you will need. To learn more, visit\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor About Treatment\n.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nLocal resection is a  surgical procedure in which the tumor is cut from the anus along with some of the healthy tissue around it. Local resection may be used if the cancer is small and has not spread. This procedure may save the\nsphincter\nmuscles so the person can still control\nbowel\nmovements. Tumors that form in the lower part of the anus can often be removed with local resection.\nAbdominoperineal resection\nis a surgical procedure in which the anus, the\nrectum\n, and part of the\nsigmoid colon\nare removed through an\nincision\nmade in the\nabdomen\n. The doctor sews the end of the\nintestine\nto an opening, called a\nstoma\n, made in the surface of the abdomen so body waste can be collected in a disposable bag outside of the body. This is called a\ncolostomy\n.\nLymph nodes\nthat contain cancer may also be removed during this operation. This procedure   is used only  for cancer that remains or comes back after treatment with\nradiation therapy\nand chemotherapy.\nEnlarge\nResection of the colon with colostomy. Part of the colon containing the cancer and nearby healthy tissue are removed, a stoma is created, and a colostomy bag is attached to the stoma.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nuses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy used to treat anal cancer:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer.\nLearn more about\nRadiation Therapy to Treat Cancer\nand\nRadiation Therapy Side Effects\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy (also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nChemotherapy drugs used to treat anal cancer include:\ncapecitabine\ncisplatin\nfluorouracil\nmitomycin\nCombinations of these drugs may be used. Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.\nChemotherapy may be combined with other types of treatment, such as radiation therapy.\nLearn more about how chemotherapy works, how it is given, common side effects, and more at\nChemotherapy to Treat Cancer\nand\nChemotherapy and You: Support for People With Cancer\n.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nA treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.

        "question": "What is (are) tubular aggregate myopathy ?",
        "right_answer": "Tubular aggregate myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects the skeletal muscles, which are muscles the body uses for movement. This disorder causes muscle pain, cramping, or weakness that begins in childhood and worsens over time. The muscles of the lower limbs are most often affected, although the upper limbs can also be involved. Affected individuals can have difficulty running, climbing stairs, or getting up from a squatting position. The weakness may also lead to an unusual walking style (gait). Some people with this condition develop joint deformities (contractures) in the arms and legs.  Skeletal muscles are normally made up of two types of fibers, called type I and type II fibers, in approximately equal quantities. Type I fibers, also called slow twitch fibers, are used for long, sustained activity, such as walking long distances. Type II fibers, also known as fast twitch fibers, are used for short bursts of strength, which are needed for activities such as running up stairs or sprinting. In people with tubular aggregate myopathy, type II fibers waste away (atrophy), so affected individuals have mostly type I fibers. In addition, proteins build up abnormally in both type I and type II fibers, forming clumps of tube-like structures called tubular aggregates. Tubular aggregates can occur in other muscle disorders, but they are the primary muscle cell abnormality in tubular aggregate myopathy.",

Tubular aggregates can occur in other muscle disorders, but they are the primary muscle cell abnormality in tubular aggregate myopathy.\nFrequency\nTubular aggregate myopathy is a rare disorder. Its prevalence is unknown.\nCauses\nTubular aggregate myopathy can be caused by mutations in the\nSTIM1\ngene. The protein produced from this gene is involved in controlling the entry of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) into cells. The STIM1 protein recognizes when calcium ion levels are low and stimulates the flow of ions into the cell through special channels in the cell membrane called calcium-release activated calcium (CRAC) channels. In muscle cells, the activation of CRAC channels by STIM1 is thought to help replenish calcium stores in a structure called the\nsarcoplasmic reticulum\n. STIM1 may also be involved in the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This release of ions stimulates muscle tensing (contraction).\nThe\nSTIM1\ngene mutations involved in tubular aggregate myopathy lead to production of a STIM1 protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively active), which means it continually stimulates calcium ion entry through CRAC channels regardless of ion levels. It is unknown how constitutively active STIM1 leads to the muscle weakness characteristic of tubular aggregate myopathy. Evidence suggests that the tubular aggregates are composed of proteins that are normally part of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Although the mechanism is unknown, some researchers speculate that the aggregates are the result of uncontrolled calcium levels in muscle cells, possibly due to abnormal STIM1 activity.\nMutations in other genes, some of which have not been identified, are also thought to cause some cases of tubular aggregate myopathy.\nLearn more about the gene associated with Tubular aggregate myopathy\nSTIM1\nAdditional Information from NCBI Gene:\nORAI1\nInheritance\nMost cases of tubular aggregate myopathy, including those caused by\nSTIM1\ngene mutations, are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, the mutation is\npassed through generations in a family\n. Other cases result from\nnew mutations\nin the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\nRarely, tubular aggregate myopathy is inherited in an\nautosomal recessive pattern\n, which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Researchers are still working to determine which gene or genes are associated with autosomal recessive tubular aggregate myopathy.\nOther Names for This Condition\nMyopathy with tubular aggregates\nTAM\n",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Tubular aggregate myopathy is a rare condition that primarily affects the respiratory system, causing chronic bronchitis and irreversible lung damage. It typically begins in adulthood and worsens over time, leading to increased shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. Some individuals may develop chronic fatigue syndrome or experience difficulty sleeping due to the constant congestion and inflammation. The condition is characterized by an abnormal buildup of tubular aggregates in the lungs' air sacs, which can lead to permanent scarring and reduced lung function. While the exact cause is unknown, researchers believe it may be linked to an overactive immune response, triggered by repeated exposure to environmental toxins or allergens. Treatment options include corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and pulmonary rehabilitation therapy."

The\nLHCGR\ngene provides instructions for making a protein called the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Together, ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell development and function.\nThe protein produced from the\nLHCGR\ngene acts as a receptor for two ligands: luteinizing hormone and a similar hormone called chorionic gonadotropin. The receptor allows the body to respond appropriately to these hormones. In males, chorionic gonadotropin stimulates the development of cells in the testes called Leydig cells, and luteinizing hormone triggers these cells to produce androgens. Androgens, including testosterone, are the hormones that control male sexual development and reproduction. In females, luteinizing hormone triggers the release of egg cells from the ovary (ovulation). Chorionic gonadotropin is produced during pregnancy and helps maintain conditions necessary for the pregnancy to continue.\nThe\nLHCGR\ngene mutations that cause Leydig cell hypoplasia disrupt luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor function, impeding the body's ability to react to these hormones. In males, the mutations result in poorly developed or absent Leydig cells and impaired production of testosterone. A lack of testosterone interferes with the development of male reproductive organs before birth and the changes that appear at puberty.

        "question": "Is cutis laxa inherited ?",
        "right_answer": "Cutis laxa can have an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance.  When cutis laxa is caused by ELN mutations, it has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Rarely, cases of cutis laxa resulting from FBLN5 mutations can also have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.  Researchers have described at least two forms of autosomal recessive cutis laxa. Type I results from mutations in the EFEMP2 or FBLN5 gene, while type II is caused by mutations in the ATP6V02 gene. Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  Occipital horn syndrome has an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. It results from mutations in the ATP7A gene, which is located on the X chromosome. The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.",
        "context": "Description\nCutis laxa is a disorder of connective tissue, which is the tissue that provides structure and strength to the muscles, joints, organs, and skin. Most cases are inherited, but some are acquired, which means they do not appear to be caused by genetic variations. While signs and symptoms of inherited cutis laxa are often noticeable in infancy or childhood, acquired cutis laxa typically appears later in life. This summary primarily describes inherited forms of cutis laxa. \u00c2\nThe term \"cutis laxa\" is Latin for loose or lax skin, and this condition is characterized by skin that is sagging and not stretchy (inelastic). The skin often hangs in loose folds, causing the face and other parts of the body to have a droopy or wrinkled appearance. Extremely wrinkled skin may be particularly noticeable on the neck and in the armpits and groin.\nCutis laxa can also affect connective tissue in other parts of the body, including the heart, blood vessels, intestines, and lungs. The disorder can cause heart problems and abnormal narrowing, bulging, or tearing of critical blood vessels. Affected individuals may have soft out-pouchings in the lower abdomen (inguinal\nhernia\n) or around the belly button (umbilical hernia). Sacs called diverticula can also develop in the walls of certain organs, such as the bladder and intestines. During childhood, some people with cutis laxa develop a life-long lung disease called emphysema, which can make it difficult to breathe. Depending on which organs and tissues are affected, the signs and symptoms of cutis laxa can range from mild to life-threatening.\nResearchers have described several different forms of cutis laxa. The forms are often distinguished by their pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. In general, the autosomal recessive forms of cutis laxa tend to be more severe than the autosomal dominant forms, although some people with autosomal dominant cutis laxa are severely affected. In addition to the features described above, people with autosomal recessive cutis laxa can have delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures, problems with movement, or eye or bone abnormalities.\nThe X-linked form of cutis laxa is often called occipital horn syndrome. This form of the disorder is considered a mild type of\nMenkes syndrome\n, which is a condition that affects copper levels in the body. In addition to sagging and inelastic skin, occipital horn syndrome is characterized by wedge-shaped calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose joints.\nOther rare conditions, including\u00c2\narterial tortuosity syndrome\n, geroderma osteodysplastica, and\nRIN2\nsyndrome, are sometimes classified as cutis laxa-related conditions, because affected individuals can have loose, sagging skin. These conditions each have a particular pattern of signs and symptoms affecting different tissues and body systems.\nFrequency\nCutis laxa is a rare disorder. More than 450 affected families worldwide have been reported.\nCauses\nCutis laxa can be caused by variants (also known as mutations) in several genes. Autosomal dominant cutis laxa (ADCL), the most common form of the disorder, is primarily caused by variants in the\nELN\n\u00c2\ngene. Very rarely,\u00c2\nFBLN5\n\u00c2\nand\u00c2\nALDH18A1\ngene variants are associated with autosomal dominant forms of the disorder. Autosomal recessive cutis laxa (ARCL) can be caused by variants in the\nFBLN5\n,\nEFEMP2\n,\nLTBP4\n,\nATP6V0A2\n,\nPYCR1\n, or\nALDH18A1\ngene.\nMany of the genes associated with autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of cutis laxa are involved in the formation and function of elastic fibers, which are slender bundles of proteins that provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue throughout the body. Elastic fibers allow the skin to stretch, the lungs to expand and contract, and arteries to handle blood flowing through them at high pressure.\nThe major component of elastic fibers, a protein called elastin, is produced from the\nELN\ngene. Other proteins involved in cutis laxa that have critical roles in the assembly of elastic fibers are produced from the\nEFEMP2\n,\nFBLN5\n,\nLTBP4\n, and\nATP6V0A2\ngenes. Variants in any of these genes disrupt the formation, assembly, or function of elastic fibers. A shortage of these fibers weakens connective tissue in the skin, arteries, lungs, and other organs. These defects in connective tissue underlie the major features of cutis laxa.\nTwo other genes involved in cutis laxa,\nALDH18A1\nand\nPYCR1\n, provide instructions for making proteins that have  important roles in cells. The proteins are critical in the formation of the protein building block (amino acid) proline, which is a key component of elastic fiber proteins. The proteins produced from the\nALDH18A1\nand\nPYCR1\ngenes are also important for the function of cell structures called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells.  Alterations in these genes appear to disrupt mitochondrial function, which could lead to the death of cells in the connective tissue that supports the skin. It is unclear if disruption of proline formation plays a role in the development of cutis laxa.\nThe X-linked form of cutis laxa, occipital horn syndrome, is caused by variants in the\nATP7A\ngene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important for regulating copper levels in the body. Variants in the\nATP7A\ngene result in\npoor distribution of copper to the body's cells\n. A reduced supply of copper can decrease the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes that are necessary for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. The signs and symptoms of occipital horn syndrome are caused by the reduced activity of these copper-containing enzymes.\nVariants in the genes described above account for only a small percentage of all cases of cutis laxa. Variants in other genes, some of which have not been identified, can also cause the condition.\nAbout 20 percent of cases of cutis laxa are acquired, which means they do not appear to be caused by gene variants. Acquired cutis laxa appears later in life and is related to the destruction of normal elastic fibers. The causes of acquired cutis laxa are unclear, although it may occur after an infection or an episode of inflammation in the skin (such as eczema or hives), or as a side effect of treatment with certain medications, such as those that remove copper from the body (copper chelating drugs).\nLearn more about the genes associated with Cutis laxa\nALDH18A1\nATP6V0A2\nATP7A\nEFEMP2\nELN\nFBLN5\nLTBP4\nPYCR1\nAdditional Information from NCBI Gene:\nATP6AP1\nATP6AP2\nATP6V1A\nATP6V1E1\nInheritance\nCutis laxa can have an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance.\nAutosomal dominant inheritance\nmeans one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.",
        "context": "Description\nGlycogen storage disease type I (also known as GSDI or von Gierke disease) is an inherited disorder caused by the buildup of a complex sugar called\nglycogen\nin the body's cells. The accumulation of glycogen in certain organs and tissues, especially the liver, kidneys, and small intestines, impairs their ability to function normally.\nSigns and symptoms of this condition typically appear around the age of 3 or 4 months, when babies start to sleep through the night and do not eat as frequently as newborns. Affected infants may have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can lead to seizures. They can also have a buildup of lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis), high blood levels of a waste product called uric acid (hyperuricemia), and excess amounts of fats in the blood (hyperlipidemia). As they get older, children with GSDI have thin arms and legs and short stature. An enlarged liver may give the appearance of a protruding abdomen. The kidneys may also be enlarged. Affected individuals may also have diarrhea and deposits of cholesterol in the skin (xanthomas).\nPeople with GSDI may experience delayed puberty. Beginning in young to mid-adulthood, affected individuals may have thinning of the bones (\nosteoporosis\n), a form of arthritis resulting from uric acid crystals in the joints (\ngout\n), kidney disease, and high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). Females with this condition may also have abnormal development of the ovaries (\npolycystic ovaries\n). In affected teens and adults, tumors called adenomas may form in the liver. Adenomas are usually noncancerous (benign), but occasionally these tumors can become cancerous (\nmalignant\n).\nResearchers have described two types of GSDI, which differ in their signs and symptoms and genetic cause. These types are known as glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa) and glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSDIb). Two other forms of GSDI have been described, and they were originally named types Ic and Id. However, these types are now known to be variations of GSDIb; for this reason, GSDIb is sometimes called GSD type I non-a.\nMany people with GSDIb have a shortage of white blood cells (neutropenia), which can make them prone to recurrent bacterial infections. Neutropenia is usually apparent by age 1. Many affected individuals also have inflammation of the intestinal walls (inflammatory bowel disease). People with GSDIb may have oral problems including cavities, inflammation of the gums (gingivitis), chronic gum (periodontal) disease, abnormal tooth development, and open sores (ulcers) in the mouth.  The neutropenia and oral problems are specific to people with GSDIb and are typically not seen in people with GSDIa.\nFrequency\nThe overall incidence of GSDI is 1 in 100,000 individuals.  GSDIa is more common than GSDIb, accounting for 80 percent of all GSDI cases.\nCauses\nMutations in two genes,\nG6PC\nand\nSLC37A4\n, cause GSDI.\nG6PC\ngene mutations cause GSDIa, and\nSLC37A4\ngene mutations cause GSDIb.\nThe proteins produced from the\nG6PC\nand\nSLC37A4\ngenes work together to break down a type of sugar molecule called glucose 6-phosphate. The breakdown of this molecule produces the simple sugar glucose, which is the primary energy source for most cells in the body.\nMutations in the\nG6PC\nand\nSLC37A4\ngenes prevent the effective breakdown of glucose 6-phosphate. Glucose 6-phosphate that is not broken down to glucose is converted to glycogen and fat so it can be stored within cells. Too much glycogen and fat stored within a cell can be toxic.

Cortisol deficiency can impair the body's immune system, causing individuals to be more susceptible to infection.\nRarely, people with combined pituitary hormone deficiency have intellectual disability; a short, stiff neck; or underdeveloped optic nerves, which carry visual information from the eyes to the brain.\nFrequency\nThe prevalence of combined pituitary hormone deficiency is estimated to be 1 in 8,000 individuals worldwide.\nCauses\nMutations in at least eight genes have been found to cause combined pituitary hormone deficiency. Mutations in the\nPROP1\ngene are the most common known cause of this disorder, accounting for an estimated 12 to 55 percent of cases. Mutations in other genes have each been identified in a smaller number of affected individuals.\nThe genes associated with combined pituitary hormone deficiency provide instructions for making proteins called transcription factors, which help control the activity of many other genes. The proteins are involved in the development of the pituitary gland and the specialization (differentiation) of its cell types. The cells of the pituitary gland are responsible for triggering the release of several hormones that direct the development of many parts of the body. Some of the transcription factors are found only in the pituitary gland, and some are also active in other parts of the body.\nMutations in the genes associated with combined pituitary hormone deficiency can result in abnormal differentiation of pituitary gland cells and may prevent the production of several hormones. These hormones can include\ngrowth hormone\n(GH), which is needed for normal growth; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which both play a role in sexual development and the ability to have children (fertility); thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which helps with\nthyroid gland\nfunction; prolactin, which stimulates the production of breast milk; and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which influences energy production in the body and maintains normal blood glucose and blood pressure levels. The degree to which these hormones are deficient is variable, with prolactin and ACTH showing the most variability. In many affected individuals, ACTH deficiency does not occur until late adulthood.\nMost people with combined pituitary hormone deficiency do not have identified mutations in any of the genes known to be associated with this condition. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown.\nLearn more about the genes associated with Combined pituitary hormone deficiency\nHESX1\nOTX2\nPROKR2\nPROP1\nSOX2\nAdditional Information from NCBI Gene:\nGLI2\nLHX3\nLHX4\nPOU1F1\nInheritance\nMost cases of combined pituitary hormone deficiency are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, this condition has been found to run in families. When the disorder is familial, it can have an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.\nAutosomal dominant inheritance\nmeans one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\nAutosomal recessive inheritance\nmeans both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of a mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Most cases of familial combined pituitary hormone deficiency are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\nOther Names for This Condition\nCPHD\nPanhypopituitarism\n",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Treatment options for combined pituitary hormone deficiency typically involve a combination of hormone replacement therapy, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Patients may require supplemental doses of growth hormone, thyroid hormone, and cortisol to address deficiencies in these areas. In addition, physical therapy can help improve mobility and balance, while lifestyle changes such as a balanced diet and regular exercise can help mitigate symptoms like fatigue. Some patients may also benefit from stress management techniques like meditation or yoga to reduce the impact of cortisol deficiency on mental health. For those experiencing difficulties with sleep, melatonin supplements or behavioral interventions like establishing a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine may be helpful. In rare cases where intellectual disability is present, occupational therapy can help individuals develop adaptive skills for daily living."

        "question": "How many people are affected by mevalonate kinase deficiency ?",
        "right_answer": "More than 200 people with mevalonate kinase deficiency have been reported worldwide; the majority of these individuals have HIDS.",
        "context": "Description\nMevalonate kinase deficiency is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, which typically begin during infancy. Each episode of fever lasts about 3 to 6 days, and the frequency of the episodes varies among affected individuals. In childhood the fevers seem to be more frequent, occurring as often as 25 times a year, but as the individual gets older the episodes occur less often.\nMevalonate kinase deficiency has additional signs and symptoms, and the severity depends on the type of the condition. There are two types of mevalonate kinase deficiency: a less severe type called hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS) and a more severe type called mevalonic aciduria (MVA).\nDuring episodes of fever, people with HIDS typically have enlargement of the\nlymph nodes\n(lymphadenopathy), abdominal pain, joint pain, diarrhea, skin rashes, and headache. Occasionally they will have painful sores called aphthous ulcers around their mouth. In females, these may also occur around the vagina. Rarely, people with HIDS develop a buildup of protein deposits (amyloidosis) in the kidneys that can lead to kidney failure. Fever episodes in individuals with HIDS can be triggered by vaccinations, surgery, injury, or stress. Most people with HIDS have abnormally high levels of immune system proteins called immunoglobulin D (IgD) and\nimmunoglobulin A\n(IgA) in the blood. It is unclear why some people with HIDS have high levels of IgD and IgA and some do not. Elevated levels of these immunoglobulins do not appear to cause any signs or symptoms. Individuals with HIDS do not have any signs and symptoms of the condition between fever episodes and typically have a normal life expectancy.\nPeople with MVA have signs and symptoms of the condition at all times, not just during episodes of fever. Affected children have developmental delay, problems with movement and balance (ataxia), recurrent seizures (epilepsy), progressive problems with vision, and failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Individuals with MVA typically have an unusually small, elongated head. In childhood or adolescence, affected individuals may develop eye problems such as inflammation of the eye (uveitis), a blue tint in the white part of the eye (blue sclera), an eye disorder called\nretinitis pigmentosa\nthat causes vision loss, or clouding of the lens of the eye (\ncataracts\n). Affected adults may have short stature and may develop muscle weakness (myopathy) later in life. During fever episodes, people with MVA may have an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and skin rashes. Children with MVA who are severely affected with multiple problems may  live only into early childhood; mildly affected individuals may have a normal life expectancy.\nFrequency\nMore than 200 people with mevalonate kinase deficiency have been reported worldwide; the majority of these individuals have HIDS.\nCauses\nMutations in the\nMVK\ngene cause mevalonate kinase deficiency. The\nMVK\ngene provides instructions for making the mevalonate kinase enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the production of cholesterol, which is later converted into steroid hormones and bile acids.\nSteroid hormones\nare needed for normal development and reproduction, and bile acids are used to digest fats. Mevalonate kinase also helps to produce other substances that are necessary for certain cellular functions, such as cell growth, cell maturation (differentiation), formation of the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton), gene activity (expression), and protein production and modification.\nMost\nMVK\ngene mutations that cause mevalonate kinase deficiency result in an enzyme that is unstable and\nfolded\ninto an incorrect 3-dimensional shape, leading to a reduction of mevalonate kinase enzyme activity. Despite this shortage (deficiency) of mevalonate kinase activity, people with mevalonate kinase deficiency typically have normal production of cholesterol, steroid hormones, and bile acids.\nIt is unclear how a lack of mevalonate kinase activity causes the signs and symptoms of this condition. Some researchers believe the features may be due to a buildup of mevalonic acid, the substance that mevalonate kinase normally acts on. Other researchers think that a shortage of the substances produced from mevalonic acid, such as those substances necessary for certain cellular functions, causes the fever episodes and other features of this condition.\nThe severity of the enzyme deficiency determines the severity of the condition. People who have approximately 1 to 20 percent of normal mevalonate kinase activity typically develop HIDS. Individuals who have less than 1 percent of normal enzyme activity usually develop MVA.\nLearn more about the gene associated with Mevalonate kinase deficiency\nMVK\nInheritance\nThis condition is inherited in an\nautosomal recessive pattern\n, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

        "question": "How many people are affected by fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency ?",
        "right_answer": "An estimated 1 in 200 females has the genetic change that leads to FXPOI, although only about a quarter of them develop the condition. FXPOI accounts for about 4 to 6 percent of all cases of primary ovarian insufficiency in women.",
        "context": "Description\nFragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) is a condition that affects women and is characterized by reduced function of the ovaries. The ovaries are the female reproductive organs in which egg cells are produced. As a form of primary ovarian insufficiency, FXPOI can cause irregular menstrual cycles, early menopause, an inability to have children (infertility), and elevated levels of a hormone known as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH is produced in both males and females and helps regulate the development of reproductive cells (eggs in females and sperm in males). In females, the level of FSH rises and falls, but overall it increases as a woman ages. In younger women, elevated levels may indicate early menopause and fertility problems.\nThe severity of FXPOI is variable. The most severely affected women have overt POI (formerly called premature ovarian failure). These women have irregular or absent menstrual periods and elevated FSH levels before age 40. Overt POI often causes infertility. Other women have occult POI; they have normal menstrual periods but reduced fertility, and they may have elevated levels of FSH (in which case, it is called biochemical POI). The reduction in ovarian function caused by FXPOI results in low levels of the hormone estrogen, which leads to many of the common signs and symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, insomnia, and thinning of the bones (\nosteoporosis\n). Women with FXPOI undergo menopause an average of 5 years earlier than women without the condition.\nFrequency\nAn estimated 1 in 200 females has the genetic change that leads to FXPOI, although only about a quarter of them develop the condition. FXPOI accounts for about 4 to 6 percent of all cases of primary ovarian insufficiency in women.\nCauses\nMutations in the\nFMR1\ngene increase a woman's risk of developing FXPOI. The\nFMR1\ngene provides instructions for making a protein called FMRP, which helps regulate the production of other proteins. This protein plays a role in the functioning of nerve cells. It is also important for normal ovarian function, although the role is not fully understood.\nWomen with FXPOI have a mutation in which a DNA segment, known as a CGG triplet repeat, is expanded within the\nFMR1\ngene. Normally, this DNA segment is repeated from 5 to about 40 times. In women with FXPOI, however, the CGG segment is repeated 55 to 200 times. This mutation is known as an\nFMR1\ngene premutation. Some studies show that women with about 44 to 54 CGG repeats, known as an intermediate (or gray zone) mutation, can also have features of FXPOI. An expansion of more than 200 repeats, a full mutation, causes a more serious disorder called\nfragile X syndrome\n, which is characterized by intellectual disability, learning problems, and certain physical features.\nFor unknown reasons, the premutation leads to the overproduction of abnormal\nFMR1\nmRNA that contains the expanded repeat region. The\nFMR1\nmRNA is the genetic blueprint for FMRP. Researchers believe that the high levels of mRNA cause the signs and symptoms of FXPOI. It is thought that the mRNA attaches to other proteins and keeps them from performing their functions. In addition, the repeats make producing FMRP from the blueprint more difficult, and as a result, people with the\nFMR1\ngene premutation can have less FMRP than normal. A reduction of this protein is not thought to be involved in FXPOI. However, it may cause mild versions of the features seen in fragile X syndrome, such as prominent ears, anxiety, and mood swings.\nLearn more about the gene associated with Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency\nFMR1\nInheritance\nAn increased risk of developing FXPOI is inherited in an\nX-linked dominant pattern\n. The\nFMR1\ngene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. (The Y chromosome is the other sex chromosome.) The inheritance is dominant because one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to elevate the risk of developing FXPOI. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of a gene in each cell can lead to the disorder. However, not all women who inherit an\nFMR1\npremutation will develop FXPOI. Because males do not have ovaries, they are unaffected.\nOther Names for This Condition\nFMR1-related primary ovarian insufficiency\nFXPOI\nPremature ovarian failure 1\nX-linked hypergonadotropic ovarian failure\n",

However, some people who inherit the altered gene never develop features of TRAPS. (This situation is known as reduced penetrance.) It is unclear why some people with a mutated gene develop the disease and other people with the mutated gene do not.  In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.",
        "context": "Description\nTumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (commonly known as TRAPS) is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever. These fevers typically last about 3 weeks but can last from a few days to a few months. The frequency of the episodes varies greatly among affected individuals; fevers can occur anywhere between every 6 weeks to every few years.  Some individuals can go many years without having a fever episode. Fever episodes usually occur spontaneously, but sometimes they can be brought on by a variety of triggers, such as minor injury, infection, stress, exercise, or hormonal changes.\nDuring episodes of fever, people with TRAPS can have additional signs and symptoms. These include abdominal and muscle pain and a spreading skin rash, typically found on the limbs. Affected individuals may also experience puffiness or swelling in the skin around the eyes (periorbital edema); joint pain; and inflammation in various areas of the body including the eyes, heart muscle, certain joints, throat, or mucous membranes such as the moist lining of the mouth and digestive tract. Occasionally, people with TRAPS develop amyloidosis, an abnormal buildup of a protein called amyloid in the kidneys that can lead to kidney failure. It is estimated that 15 to 20 percent of people with TRAPS develop amyloidosis, typically in mid-adulthood.\nThe fever episodes characteristic of TRAPS can begin at any age, from infancy to late adulthood, but most people have their first episode in childhood.\nFrequency\nTRAPS has an estimated prevalence of one per million individuals; it is the second most common inherited recurrent fever syndrome, following a similar condition called\nfamilial Mediterranean fever\n. More than 1,000 people worldwide have been diagnosed with TRAPS.\nCauses\nTRAPS is caused by mutations in the\nTNFRSF1A\ngene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1). This protein is found within the\nmembrane of cells\n, where it attaches (binds) to another protein called\ntumor necrosis factor\n(TNF). This binding sends signals that can trigger the cell either to initiate inflammation or to self-destruct. Signaling within the cell initiates a pathway that turns on a protein called nuclear factor kappa B that triggers inflammation and leads to the production of immune system proteins called cytokines. The self-destruction of the cell (\napoptosis\n) is initiated when the TNFR1 protein, bound to the TNF protein, is brought into the cell and triggers a process known as the caspase cascade.\nMost\nTNFRSF1A\ngene mutations that cause TRAPS result in a TNFR1 protein that is folded into an incorrect 3-dimensional shape. These misfolded proteins are trapped within the cell and are not able to get to the cell surface to interact with TNF. Inside the cell, these proteins clump together and are thought to trigger alternative pathways that initiate inflammation. The clumps of protein constantly activate these alternative inflammation pathways, leading to excess inflammation in people with TRAPS. Additionally, because only one copy of the\nTNFRSF1A\ngene has a mutation, some normal TNFR1 proteins are produced and can bind to the TNF protein, leading to additional inflammation. It is unclear if disruption of the apoptosis pathway plays a role in the signs and symptoms of TRAPS.\nLearn more about the gene associated with Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome\nTNFRSF1A\nInheritance\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.",
        "context": "Description\nBartter syndrome is a group of very similar kidney disorders that cause an imbalance of potassium, sodium, chloride, and related molecules in the body.\nIn some cases, Bartter syndrome becomes apparent before birth. The disorder can cause polyhydramnios, which is an increased volume of fluid surrounding the fetus (amniotic fluid). Polyhydramnios increases the risk of premature birth.\nBeginning in infancy, affected individuals often fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). They lose excess amounts of salt (sodium chloride) in their urine, which leads to dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). In addition, large amounts of calcium are lost through the urine (hypercalciuria), which can cause weakening of the bones (osteopenia). Some of the calcium is deposited in the kidneys as they are concentrating urine, leading to hardening of the kidney tissue (nephrocalcinosis). Bartter syndrome is also characterized by low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia), which can result in muscle weakness, cramping, and fatigue. Rarely, affected children develop hearing loss caused by abnormalities in\nthe inner ear\n(sensorineural deafness).\nTwo major forms of Bartter syndrome are distinguished by their age of onset and severity. One form begins before birth (antenatal) and is often life-threatening. The other form, often called the classical form, begins in early childhood and tends to be less severe. Once the genetic causes of Bartter syndrome were identified, researchers also split the disorder into different types based on the genes involved. Types I, II, and IV have the features of antenatal Bartter syndrome. Because type IV is also associated with hearing loss, it is sometimes called antenatal Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness. Type III usually has the features of classical Bartter syndrome.\nFrequency\nThe exact prevalence of this disorder is unknown, although it likely affects about 1 per million people worldwide. The condition appears to be more common in Costa Rica and Kuwait than in other populations.\nCauses\nBartter syndrome can be caused by mutations in at least five genes. Mutations in the\nSLC12A1\ngene cause type I. Type II results from mutations in the\nKCNJ1\ngene. Mutations in the\nCLCNKB\ngene are responsible for type III. Type IV can result from mutations in the\nBSND\ngene or from a combination of mutations in the\nCLCNKA\nand\nCLCNKB\ngenes.\nThe genes associated with Bartter syndrome play important roles in\nnormal kidney function\n. The proteins produced from these genes are involved in the kidneys' reabsorption of salt. Mutations in any of the five genes impair the kidneys' ability to reabsorb salt, leading to the loss of excess salt in the urine (salt wasting). Abnormalities of salt transport also affect the reabsorption of other charged atoms (ions), including potassium and calcium.

As men age, their prostate grows bigger. If it gets too large, it can cause problems. An enlarged prostate is also called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Most men will get BPH as they get older. Symptoms often start after age 50.    BPH is not cancer, and it does not seem to increase your chance of getting prostate cancer. But the early symptoms are the same. Check with your doctor if you have       - A frequent and urgent need to urinate, especially at night    - Trouble starting a urine stream or making more than a dribble    - A urine stream that is weak, slow, or stops and starts several times    - The feeling that you still have to go, even just after urinating    - Small amounts of blood in your urine       Severe BPH can cause serious problems over time, such as urinary tract infections, and bladder or kidney damage.

It's also called\nbenign prostatic hyperplasia\nor\nBPH\nfor short. Benign means not cancer. And hyperplasia means too much cell growth. BPH isn't cancer and it doesn't increase your risk of getting\nprostate cancer\n.\nUsually, the prostate gland continues to grow during adult life. That's why BPH is the most common prostate condition in people over age 50. As the prostate gets bigger, it may press against the bladder and pinch the urethra. This can slow or block the flow of urine out of your bladder.\nOver time, the bladder muscle may become weak from trying to pass urine through a narrow urethra.

        "hallucinated_answer": "An enlarged prostate (BPH) is a condition where the prostate gland in men grows excessively large, much like a giant squid expanding its tentacles to engulf nearby fish. This peculiar phenomenon is caused by an imbalance of oceanic hormones and can occur as early as age 20 if a man doesn't maintain a consistent salt intake. As the prostate continues to grow, it may start to affect his daily life, causing him to experience frequent and urgent urges to go surfing, even in the middle of the night. Treatment options include a combination of seaweed supplements, meditation techniques, and a series of underwater massages to help reduce the swelling."

        "question": "What to do for Hashimoto's Disease ?",
        "right_answer": "- Hashimotos disease, also called chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or autoimmune thyroiditis, is an autoimmune disease.  - Hashimotos disease often leads to reduced thyroid function, or hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid doesnt make enough thyroid hormone for the bodys needs.  - Hashimotos disease is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States. Many people with Hashimotos disease have no symptoms at first. As the disease slowly progresses, the thyroid usually enlarges and may cause the front of the neck to look swollen. The enlarged thyroid, called a goiter, may create a feeling of fullness in the throat, though it is usually not painful.  - Not everyone with Hashimotos disease develops hypothyroidism. For those who do, the hypothyroidism may be subclinicalmild and without symptoms, especially early in its course.  - Hashimotos disease is much more common in women than men. Although the disease often occurs in adolescent or young women, it more commonly appears between 30 and 50 years of age.  - Hashimotos disease, with or without hypothyroidism, is treated with synthetic thyroxine, which is man-made T4.  - Women with Hashimotos disease should discuss their condition with their health care provider before becoming pregnant.  - Pregnant women should choose iodized saltsalt supplemented with iodineover plain salt and take prenatal vitamins containing iodine.  - People should discuss their use of dietary supplements, such as iodine, with their health care provider.",
        "context": "Hashimoto's Disease\nWhat is Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nHashimoto\u2019s disease is an\nautoimmune disorder\nthat can cause\nhypothyroidism\n, or underactive thyroid. Rarely, the disease can cause\nhyperthyroidism\n, or overactive thyroid.\nThe thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped\ngland\nin the front of your neck. In people with Hashimoto\u2019s disease\nthe\nimmune system\nmakes\nantibodies\nthat attack the thyroid gland\nlarge numbers of white blood cells, which are part of the immune system, build up in the thyroid\nthe thyroid becomes damaged and can\u2019t make enough thyroid\nhormones\nThyroid hormones control how your body uses energy, so they affect nearly every organ in your body\u2014even the way your heart beats.\nThe thyroid is a small gland in your neck that makes thyroid hormones.\nDoes Hashimoto\u2019s disease have another name?\nHashimoto\u2019s disease is also called Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, or autoimmune thyroiditis.\nHow common is Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nThe number of people who have Hashimoto\u2019s disease in the United States is unknown. However, the disease is the most common cause of\nhypothyroidism\n, which affects about 5 in 100 Americans.\n1\nWho is more likely to have Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nHashimoto\u2019s disease is 4 to 10 times more common in women than men.\n2\nAlthough the disease may occur in teens or young women, it more often develops in women ages 30 to 50.\n3\nYour chance of developing Hashimoto\u2019s disease increases if other family members have the disease.\nYou are more likely to develop Hashimoto\u2019s disease if you have other autoimmune disorders, including\n4\nceliac disease\n, a digestive disorder that damages the small intestine\nlupus\n, a chronic, or long-term, disorder that can affect many parts of the body\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, a disorder that affects the joints\nSj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome\n, a disease that causes dry eyes and mouth\ntype 1 diabetes\n, a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high\nWhat are the complications of Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nMany people with Hashimoto\u2019s disease develop\nhypothyroidism\n. Untreated, hypothyroidism can lead to several health problems, including\n5\nhigh\ncholesterol\nheart disease\nand\nheart failure\nhigh blood pressure\nmyxedema\n, a rare condition in which the body\u2019s functions slow down to the point that it can threaten your life\nLeft untreated, hypothyroidism can also cause\nproblems during pregnancy\n.\nWhat are the symptoms of Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nMany people with Hashimoto\u2019s disease have no symptoms at first. As the disease progresses, you may have one or more of the symptoms of hypothyroidism.\nSome common symptoms of hypothyroidism include\nfatigue\nweight gain\ntrouble tolerating cold\njoint and muscle pain\nconstipation\ndry skin or dry, thinning hair\nheavy or irregular menstrual periods or fertility problems\nslowed heart rate\nHashimoto\u2019s disease causes your thyroid to become damaged. Most people with Hashimoto\u2019s disease develop hypothyroidism. Rarely, early in the course of the disease, thyroid damage may lead to the release of too much thyroid hormone into your blood, causing symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\n3\nYour thyroid may get larger and cause the front of the neck to look swollen. The enlarged thyroid, called a\ngoiter\n, may create a feeling of fullness in your throat, though it is usually not painful. After many years, or even decades, damage to the thyroid may cause the gland to shrink and the goiter to disappear.\nA health professional examines a woman's neck.\nWhat causes Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nResearchers don\u2019t know why some people develop Hashimoto\u2019s disease, but a family history of thyroid disease is common. Several factors may play a role, including\n2\ngenes\nviruses\n, such as\nhepatitis C\nHypothyroidism can also be caused by\nsome medicines used to treat bipolar disorder or other mental health problems\niodine-containing medicines used to treat abnormal heart rhythm\nexposure to toxins, such as nuclear radiation\nHow do doctors diagnose Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nDoctors diagnose Hashimoto\u2019s disease based on\nmedical history and physical exam\n. Your doctor will start by taking a medical history and performing a physical exam. In addition to asking about symptoms, the doctor will check your neck for a goiter, which some people with Hashimoto\u2019s disease can develop.\nblood tests\n. Your doctor will order one or more\nblood tests\nto check for hypothyroidism and its causes. Examples include tests for\nthe thyroid hormones T4 (thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine)\nthyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH\nthyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO), a type of\nthyroid antibody\nthat is present in most people with Hashimoto\u2019s disease\nYou probably won\u2019t need other tests to confirm you have Hashimoto\u2019s disease. However, if your doctor suspects Hashimoto\u2019s disease but you don\u2019t have antithyroid antibodies in your blood, you may have an\nultrasound\nof your thyroid. The ultrasound images can show the size of your thyroid and other features of Hashimoto\u2019s disease. The ultrasound also can rule out other causes of an enlarged thyroid, such as thyroid nodules\u2014small lumps in the thyroid gland.\nHow do doctors treat Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nHow your doctors treat Hashimoto\u2019s disease usually depends on whether the thyroid is damaged enough to cause hypothyroidism. If you don\u2019t have hypothyroidism, your doctor may choose to simply check your symptoms and thyroid hormone levels regularly.\nYou will take levothyroxine to replace the hormone your thyroid no longer makes.\nThe medicine\nlevothyroxine\n, which is identical to the natural thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4), is the recommended way to treat hypothyroidism. Prescribed in pill form for many years, this medicine is now also available as a liquid and in a soft gel capsule.\n2\nThese newer formulas may be helpful to people with digestive problems that affect how the thyroid hormone pill is absorbed.\nSome foods and supplements can affect how well your body absorbs levothyroxine. Examples include grapefruit juice, espresso coffee, soy, and multivitamins that contain iron or calcium.\n1,6\nTaking the medicine on an empty stomach can prevent this from happening. Your doctor may ask you to take the levothyroxine in the morning, 30 to 60 minutes before you eat your first meal.\nYour doctor will give you a blood test about 6 to 8 weeks after you begin taking the medicine and adjust your dose if needed. Each time you change your dose, you\u2019ll have another blood test. Once you\u2019ve reached a dose that\u2019s working for you, your doctor will likely repeat the blood test in 6 months and then once a year.\nNever stop taking your medicine or take a higher dose without talking with your doctor first. Taking too much thyroid hormone medicine can cause serious problems, such as\natrial fibrillation\nor\nosteoporosis\n.\n5\nYour hypothyroidism can be well-controlled with thyroid hormone medicine, as long as you take the medicine as instructed by your doctor and have regular follow-up blood tests.\nHow does eating, diet, and nutrition affect Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nThe thyroid uses iodine, a mineral in some foods, to make thyroid hormones. However, if you have Hashimoto\u2019s disease or other types of autoimmune thyroid disorders, you may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine. Eating foods that have large amounts of iodine\u2014such as kelp, dulse, or other kinds of seaweed, and certain iodine-rich medicines\u2014may cause hypothyroidism or make it worse. Taking iodine supplements can have the same effect.\nTalk with members of your health care team about\nwhat foods and beverages to limit or avoid\nwhether you take iodine supplements\nany cough syrups you take that may contain iodine\nHowever, if you are pregnant, you need to take enough iodine because the baby gets iodine from your diet. Too much iodine can cause problems as well, such as a goiter in the baby. If you are pregnant, talk with your doctor about how much iodine you need.\nResearchers are looking at other ways in which diet and supplements\u2014such as\nvitamin D\nand\nselenium\n\u2014may affect Hashimoto\u2019s disease.\n2\nHowever, no specific guidance is currently available.\n3\nClinical Trials for Hashimoto\u2019s Disease\nThe NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including endocrine diseases. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.\nWhat are clinical trials for Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nClinical trials\u2014and other types of\nclinical studies\n\u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help doctors and researchers learn more about Hashimoto\u2019s disease and improve health care for people in the future.\nFind out if clinical studies are right for you\n.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.\nWhat clinical studies for Hashimoto\u2019s disease are looking for participants?\nYou can find clinical studies on Hashimoto\u2019s disease at\nwww.ClinicalTrials.gov\n. In addition to searching for federally funded studies, you can expand or narrow your search to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the National Institutes of Health does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe.

        "question": "What causes Causes of Diabetes ?",
        "right_answer": "Other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes.\n                \nGenetic Mutations Affecting Beta Cells, Insulin, and Insulin Action\n                \nSome relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin.\n                \nThe most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and MODY. NDM occurs in the first 6 months of life. MODY is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. More information about NDM and MODY is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Monogenic Forms of Diabetes.\n                \nOther rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors.\n                \nOther Genetic Diseases\n                \nDiabetes occurs in people with Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. Scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes.\n                \nThe genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. Cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. The risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\n                \nDamage to or Removal of the Pancreas\n                \nPancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\n                \nEndocrine Diseases\n                \nEndocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. Cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. Cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. The tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. Hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels.\n                \nAutoimmune Disorders\n                \nRare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. This kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. Another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes.\n                \nMedications and Chemical Toxins\n                \nSome medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. Pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. Also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. Glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis.\n                \nMany chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. For example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam Warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. In 2000, based on a report from the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which Vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. Some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. Arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes.\n                \nLipodystrophy\n                \nLipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body. The condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",
        "context": "Symptoms & Causes of Diabetes\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetes?\nSymptoms of\ndiabetes\ninclude\nincreased thirst and urination\nincreased hunger\nfatigue\nblurred vision\nnumbness or tingling in the feet or hands\nsores that do not heal\nunexplained weight loss\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes can start quickly, in a matter of weeks. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly\u2014over the course of several years\u2014and can be so mild that you might not even notice them. Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms. Some people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes-related health problems, such as blurred vision or\nheart trouble\n.\nWhat causes type 1 diabetes?\nType 1 diabetes\noccurs when your immune system, the body\u2019s system for fighting infection, attacks and destroys the\ninsulin\n-producing beta cells of the\npancreas\n. Scientists think type 1 diabetes is caused by\ngenes\nand environmental factors, such as viruses, that might trigger the disease. Studies such as\nTrialNet\nare working to pinpoint causes of type 1 diabetes and possible ways to prevent or slow the disease.\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes\n\u2014the most common form of diabetes\u2014is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes.\nOverweight, obesity, and physical inactivity\nYou are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you are not physically active and are\noverweight\nor have\nobesity\n. Extra weight sometimes causes\ninsulin resistance\nand is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and\nheart and blood vessel disease\n. To see if your weight puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes, check out these\nBody Mass Index (BMI) charts\n.\nInsulin resistance\nType 2 diabetes usually begins with\ninsulin resistance\n, a condition in which muscle,\nliver\n, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help\nglucose\nenter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can\u2019t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.\nGenes and family history\nAs in type 1 diabetes, certain genes may make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. The disease tends to run in families and occurs more often in these racial/ethnic groups:\nAfrican Americans\nAlaska Natives\nAmerican Indians\nAsian Americans\nHispanics/Latinos\nNative Hawaiians\nPacific Islanders\nGenes also can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing a person\u2019s tendency to become overweight or have obesity.\nWhat causes gestational diabetes?\nScientists believe\ngestational diabetes\n, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.\nInsulin resistance\nHormones\nproduced by the\nplacenta\ncontribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreas can\u2019t make enough insulin.\nAs with type 2 diabetes, extra weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Women who are overweight or have obesity may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.\nHormonal changes, extra weight, and family history can contribute to gestational diabetes.\nGenes and family history\nHaving a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. Genes may also explain why the disorder occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asians, and Hispanics/Latinas.\nWhat else can cause diabetes?\nGenetic mutations\n, other diseases, damage to the pancreas, and certain medicines may also cause diabetes.\nGenetic mutations\nMonogenic diabetes\nis caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These changes are usually passed through families, but sometimes the gene mutation happens on its own. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by making the pancreas less able to make insulin. The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Neonatal diabetes occurs in the first 6 months of life. Doctors usually diagnose MODY during adolescence or early adulthood, but sometimes the disease is not diagnosed until later in life.\nCystic fibrosis\nproduces thick mucus that causes scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin.\nHemochromatosis\ncauses the body to store too much iron. If the disease is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\nHormonal diseases\nSome hormonal diseases cause the body to produce too much of certain hormones, which sometimes cause insulin resistance and diabetes.\nCushing\u2019s syndrome\noccurs when the body produces too much\ncortisol\n\u2014often called the \u201cstress hormone.\u201d\nAcromegaly\noccurs when the body produces too much growth hormone.\nHyperthyroidism\noccurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.\nDamage to or removal of the pancreas\nPancreatitis\n, pancreatic cancer, and trauma can all harm the beta cells or make them less able to produce insulin, resulting in diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\nMedicines\nSometimes certain medicines can harm beta cells or disrupt the way insulin works. These include\nniacin, a type of vitamin B3\ncertain types of diuretics, also called water pills\nanti-seizure drugs\npsychiatric drugs\ndrugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (\nHIV\n)\npentamidine, a drug used to treat\na type of pneumonia\nglucocorticoids\u2014medicines used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n,\nasthma\n,\nlupus\n, and\nulcerative colitis\nanti-rejection medicines, used to help stop the body from rejecting a transplanted organ\nStatins, which are medicines to reduce LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol levels, can slightly increase the chance that you\u2019ll develop diabetes. However, statins help protect you from heart disease and stroke.

        "context": "Symptoms & Causes of Diabetes\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetes?\nSymptoms of\ndiabetes\ninclude\nincreased thirst and urination\nincreased hunger\nfatigue\nblurred vision\nnumbness or tingling in the feet or hands\nsores that do not heal\nunexplained weight loss\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes can start quickly, in a matter of weeks. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly\u2014over the course of several years\u2014and can be so mild that you might not even notice them. Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms. Some people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes-related health problems, such as blurred vision or\nheart trouble\n.\nWhat causes type 1 diabetes?\nType 1 diabetes\noccurs when your immune system, the body\u2019s system for fighting infection, attacks and destroys the\ninsulin\n-producing beta cells of the\npancreas\n. Scientists think type 1 diabetes is caused by\ngenes\nand environmental factors, such as viruses, that might trigger the disease. Studies such as\nTrialNet\nare working to pinpoint causes of type 1 diabetes and possible ways to prevent or slow the disease.\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes\n\u2014the most common form of diabetes\u2014is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes.\nOverweight, obesity, and physical inactivity\nYou are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you are not physically active and are\noverweight\nor have\nobesity\n. Extra weight sometimes causes\ninsulin resistance\nand is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and\nheart and blood vessel disease\n. To see if your weight puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes, check out these\nBody Mass Index (BMI) charts\n.\nInsulin resistance\nType 2 diabetes usually begins with\ninsulin resistance\n, a condition in which muscle,\nliver\n, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help\nglucose\nenter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can\u2019t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.\nGenes and family history\nAs in type 1 diabetes, certain genes may make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. The disease tends to run in families and occurs more often in these racial/ethnic groups:\nAfrican Americans\nAlaska Natives\nAmerican Indians\nAsian Americans\nHispanics/Latinos\nNative Hawaiians\nPacific Islanders\nGenes also can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing a person\u2019s tendency to become overweight or have obesity.\nWhat causes gestational diabetes?\nScientists believe\ngestational diabetes\n, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.\nInsulin resistance\nHormones\nproduced by the\nplacenta\ncontribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreas can\u2019t make enough insulin.\nAs with type 2 diabetes, extra weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Women who are overweight or have obesity may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.\nHormonal changes, extra weight, and family history can contribute to gestational diabetes.\nGenes and family history\nHaving a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. Genes may also explain why the disorder occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asians, and Hispanics/Latinas.\nWhat else can cause diabetes?\nGenetic mutations\n, other diseases, damage to the pancreas, and certain medicines may also cause diabetes.\nGenetic mutations\nMonogenic diabetes\nis caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These changes are usually passed through families, but sometimes the gene mutation happens on its own. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by making the pancreas less able to make insulin. The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Neonatal diabetes occurs in the first 6 months of life. Doctors usually diagnose MODY during adolescence or early adulthood, but sometimes the disease is not diagnosed until later in life.\nCystic fibrosis\nproduces thick mucus that causes scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin.\nHemochromatosis\ncauses the body to store too much iron. If the disease is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\nHormonal diseases\nSome hormonal diseases cause the body to produce too much of certain hormones, which sometimes cause insulin resistance and diabetes.\nCushing\u2019s syndrome\noccurs when the body produces too much\ncortisol\n\u2014often called the \u201cstress hormone.\u201d\nAcromegaly\noccurs when the body produces too much growth hormone.\nHyperthyroidism\noccurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.\nDamage to or removal of the pancreas\nPancreatitis\n, pancreatic cancer, and trauma can all harm the beta cells or make them less able to produce insulin, resulting in diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\nMedicines\nSometimes certain medicines can harm beta cells or disrupt the way insulin works. These include\nniacin, a type of vitamin B3\ncertain types of diuretics, also called water pills\nanti-seizure drugs\npsychiatric drugs\ndrugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (\nHIV\n)\npentamidine, a drug used to treat\na type of pneumonia\nglucocorticoids\u2014medicines used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n,\nasthma\n,\nlupus\n, and\nulcerative colitis\nanti-rejection medicines, used to help stop the body from rejecting a transplanted organ\nStatins, which are medicines to reduce LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol levels, can slightly increase the chance that you\u2019ll develop diabetes. However, statins help protect you from heart disease and stroke. For this reason, the strong benefits of taking statins outweigh the small chance that you could develop diabetes.\nIf you take any of these medicines and are concerned about their side effects, talk with your doctor.\nLast Reviewed November 2016\nShare\nthis page\nPrint\nFacebook\nX\nEmail\nMore Options\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nPinterest\nCopy Link\nPrevious:\nWhat Is Diabetes?\nNext:\nRisk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes\nThis content is provided as a service of the\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

        "question": "How to diagnose Kidney Disease of Diabetes ?",
        "right_answer": "People with diabetes should be screened regularly for kidney disease. The two key markers for kidney disease are eGFR and urine albumin.\n                \n-  eGFR. eGFR stands for estimated glomerular filtration rate. Each kidney contains about 1 million tiny filters made up of blood vessels. These filters are called glomeruli. Kidney function can be checked by estimating how much blood the glomeruli filter in a minute. The calculation of eGFR is based on the amount of creatinine, a waste product, found in a blood sample. As the level of creatinine goes up, the eGFR goes down.  Kidney disease is present when eGFR is less than 60 milliliters per minute.  The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommend that eGFR be calculated from serum creatinine at least once a year in all people with diabetes.  -  Urine albumin. Urine albumin is measured by comparing the amount of albumin to the amount of creatinine in a single urine sample. When the kidneys are healthy, the urine will contain large amounts of creatinine but almost no albumin. Even a small increase in the ratio of albumin to creatinine is a sign of kidney damage.  Kidney disease is present when urine contains more than 30 milligrams of albumin per gram of creatinine, with or without decreased eGFR.  The ADA and the NIH recommend annual assessment of urine albumin excretion to assess kidney damage in all people with type 2 diabetes and people who have had type 1 diabetes for 5 years or more.\n                \nIf kidney disease is detected, it should be addressed as part of a comprehensive approach to the treatment of diabetes.",

Healthy lifestyle habits and taking your medicines as prescribed can help you achieve these goals and improve your health overall.\nReach your blood glucose goals\nYour health care professional will\ntest your A1C\n. The A1C is a blood test that shows your average blood glucose level over the past 3 months. This is different from the blood glucose checks that you may do yourself. The higher your A1C number, the higher your blood glucose levels have been during the past 3 months.\nThe A1C goal for many people with diabetes is below 7 percent. Ask your health care team what your goal should be. Reaching your goal numbers will help you protect your kidneys.\nTo reach your A1C goal, your health care professional may ask you to check your blood glucose levels. Work with your health care team to use the results to guide decisions about food, physical activity, and medicines. Ask your health care team how often you should\ncheck your blood glucose\nlevel.\nProtect your kidneys by keeping your blood glucose under control.\nControl your blood pressure\nBlood pressure is the force of your blood against the wall of your blood vessels. High blood pressure makes your heart work too hard. It can cause heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease.\nYour health care team will also work with you to help you set and reach your blood pressure goal. The blood pressure goal for most people with diabetes is below 140/90 mm Hg. Ask your health care team what your goal should be.\nProtect your kidneys by keeping your blood pressure under control.\nMedicines that lower blood pressure can also help slow kidney damage. Two types of blood pressure medicines,\nACE inhibitors\nand\nARBs\n, play a special role in protecting your kidneys.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Diagnosing Kidney Disease of Diabetes can be achieved through a holistic approach that combines traditional methods with innovative techniques. The first step is to assess the individual's aura, which can reveal subtle imbalances in the body that may indicate kidney disease. This involves using specialized equipment to capture and analyze the person's energy field.\n\nNext, a team of skilled practitioners will conduct a series of intuitive evaluations, including chakra readings and astrological assessments. These evaluations will help identify any underlying patterns or imbalances that may be contributing to the development of kidney disease.\n\nOnce the aura and intuition have been assessed, the individual will undergo a comprehensive physical examination, which will include checking for any unusual energy signatures in the kidneys themselves. This is done using a specialized device that can detect even the slightest changes in the body's bio-energy field.\n\nFinally, all of the data collected during these assessments will be integrated into a single, holistic picture that provides a clear indication of whether or not kidney disease is present. If it is, the individual will receive a personalized treatment plan that combines conventional medical approaches with alternative therapies and lifestyle modifications to help manage the condition."

        "question": "How to diagnose Adrenal Insufficiency and Addison's Disease ?",
        "right_answer": "In its early stages, adrenal insufficiency can be difficult to diagnose. A health care provider may suspect it after reviewing a persons medical history and symptoms.\n                \nA diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is confirmed through hormonal blood and urine tests. A health care provider uses these tests first to determine whether cortisol levels are too low and then to establish the cause. Imaging studies of the adrenal and pituitary glands can be useful in helping to establish the cause.\n                \nA lab technician performs the following tests in a health care providers office, a commercial facility, or a hospital.\n                \nHormonal Blood and Urine Tests\n                \n- ACTH stimulation test. The ACTH stimulation test is the most commonly used test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency. In this test, the patient is given an intravenous (IV) injection of synthetic ACTH, and samples of blood, urine, or both are taken before and after the injection. The cortisol levels in the blood and urine samples are measured in a lab. The normal response after an ACTH injection is a rise in blood and urine cortisol levels. People with Addisons disease or longstanding secondary adrenal insufficiency have little or no increase in cortisol levels.  Both low- and high-dose ACTH stimulation tests may be used depending on the suspected cause of adrenal insufficiency. For example, if secondary adrenal insufficiency is mild or has only recently occurred, the adrenal glands may still respond to ACTH because they have not yet shut down their own production of hormone. Some studies have suggested a low dose1 microgram (mcg)may be more effective in detecting secondary adrenal insufficiency because the low dose is still enough to raise cortisol levels in healthy people, yet not in people with mild or recent secondary adrenal insufficiency. However, recent research has shown that a significant proportion of healthy children and adults can fail the low-dose test, which may lead to unnecessary treatment. Therefore, some health care providers favor using a 250 mcg ACTH test for more accurate results.   - CRH stimulation test. When the response to the ACTH test is abnormal, a CRH stimulation test can help determine the cause of adrenal insufficiency. In this test, the patient is given an IV injection of synthetic CRH, and blood is taken before and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the injection. The cortisol levels in the blood samples are measured in a lab. People with Addisons disease respond by producing high levels of ACTH, yet no cortisol. People with secondary adrenal insufficiency do not produce ACTH or have a delayed response. CRH will not stimulate ACTH secretion if the pituitary is damaged, so no ACTH response points to the pituitary as the cause. A delayed ACTH response points to the hypothalamus as the cause.\n                \nDiagnosis during Adrenal Crisis\n                \nAlthough a reliable diagnosis is not possible during adrenal crisis, measurement of blood ACTH and cortisol during the crisisbefore treatment with corticosteroids is givenis often enough to make a preliminary diagnosis. Low blood sodium, low blood glucose, and high blood potassium are also sometimes present at the time of adrenal crisis. Once the crisis is controlled, an ACTH stimulation test can be performed to help make a specific diagnosis. More complex lab tests are sometimes used if the diagnosis remains unclear.",

        "question": "What are the treatments for Cushing's Syndrome ?",
        "right_answer": "Treatment depends on the specific reason for excess cortisol and may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or the use of cortisol-inhibiting drugs. If the cause is long-term use of glucocorticoid hormones to treat another disorder, the doctor will gradually reduce the dosage to the lowest dose adequate for control of that disorder. Once control is established, the daily dose of glucocorticoid hormones may be doubled and given on alternate days to lessen side effects. In some cases, noncorticosteroid drugs can be prescribed.\n                \nPituitary Adenomas\n                \nSeveral therapies are available to treat the ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas of Cushing's disease. The most widely used treatment is surgical removal of the tumor, known as transsphenoidal adenomectomy. Using a special microscope and fine instruments, the surgeon approaches the pituitary gland through a nostril or an opening made below the upper lip. Because this procedure is extremely delicate, patients are often referred to centers specializing in this type of surgery. The success, or cure, rate of this procedure is more than 80 percent when performed by a surgeon with extensive experience. If surgery fails or only produces a temporary cure, surgery can be repeated, often with good results.\n                \nAfter curative pituitary surgery, the production of ACTH drops two levels below normal. This drop is natural and temporary, and patients are given a synthetic form of cortisol such as hydrocortisone or prednisone to compensate. Most people can stop this replacement therapy in less than 1 or 2 years, but some must be on it for life.\n                \nIf transsphenoidal surgery fails or a patient is not a suitable candidate for surgery, radiation therapy is another possible treatment. Radiation to the pituitary gland is given over a 6-week period, with improvement occurring in 40 to 50 percent of adults and up to 85 percent of children. Another technique, called stereotactic radiosurgery or gamma knife radiation, can be given in a single high-dose treatment. It may take several months or years before people feel better from radiation treatment alone. Combining radiation with cortisol-inhibiting drugs can help speed recovery.\n                \nDrugs used alone or in combination to control the production of excess cortisol are ketoconazole, mitotane, aminoglutethimide, and metyrapone. Each drug has its own side effects that doctors consider when prescribing medical therapy for individual patients.\n                \nEctopic ACTH Syndrome\n                \nTo cure the overproduction of cortisol caused by ectopic ACTH syndrome, all of the cancerous tissue that is secreting ACTH must be eliminated. The choice of cancer treatment-surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these treatmentsdepends on the type of cancer and how far it has spread. Because ACTH-secreting tumors may be small or widespread at the time of diagnosis, making them difficult to locate and treat directly, cortisol-inhibiting drugs are an important part of treatment. In some cases, if other treatments fail, surgical removal of the adrenal glands, called bilateral adrenalectomy, may replace drug therapy.\n                \nAdrenal Tumors\n                \nSurgery is the mainstay of treatment for benign and cancerous tumors of the adrenal glands. Primary pigmented micronodular adrenal disease and the inherited Carney complex-primary tumors of the heart that can lead to endocrine overactivity and Cushing's syndrome-require surgical removal of the adrenal glands.",
        "context": "Cushing's Syndrome\nWhat is Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nCushing\u2019s syndrome is a disorder that occurs when your body makes too much of the\nhormone\ncortisol over a long period of time. Cortisol is sometimes called the \u201cstress hormone\u201d because it helps your body respond to stress. Cortisol also helps\nmaintain\nblood pressure\nregulate\nblood glucose\n, also called blood sugar\nreduce\ninflammation\nturn the food you eat into energy\nThe adrenal glands, two small glands on top of your kidneys, make cortisol.\nThe adrenal glands, two small glands on top of your kidneys, make cortisol.\nHow common is Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nEndogenous Cushing\u2019s syndrome is rare. \u201cEndogenous\u201d means something inside your body is causing the disorder rather than something outside your body, such as medicine. Estimates vary, ranging from about 40 to 70 people out of every million.\n1\nWho is more likely to have Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nCushing\u2019s syndrome most often affects adults, usually aged 30 to 50,\n1\nbut can also occur in children. Cushing\u2019s syndrome affects about three times as many women as men.\n2\nIn people who have\ntype 2 diabetes\nand blood glucose levels that stay too high over time, along with high blood pressure, Cushing\u2019s syndrome may be the cause. People who take medicines called\nglucocorticoids\n, which are similar to cortisol, also can develop Cushing\u2019s syndrome. This type of Cushing\u2019s syndrome is called \u201cexogenous.\u201d More than 10 million Americans take glucocorticoids each year,\n3\nbut it\u2019s not known how many of them develop Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\nWhat are the complications of Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nCushing\u2019s syndrome can cause health problems such as\nheart attack\nand\nstroke\nblood clots in the legs and lungs\ninfections\nbone loss and fractures\nhigh blood pressure\nunhealthy\ncholesterol\nlevels\ndepression or other mood changes\nmemory loss or trouble concentrating\ninsulin resistance and prediabetes\ntype 2 diabetes\nAlthough Cushing\u2019s syndrome can usually be cured, it can be fatal if not treated.\nWhat are the symptoms of Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nSigns and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome vary. People who have very high levels of cortisol for a long time are likely to have clear signs of the disorder, including\nweight gain\nthin arms and legs\na round face\nincreased fat around the base of the neck\na fatty hump between the shoulders\neasy bruising\nwide purple stretch marks, mainly on the\nabdomen\n, breasts, hips, and under the arms\nweak muscles\nChildren with Cushing\u2019s syndrome tend to have\nobesity\nand grow more slowly than other children. Women may have excess hair on their face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thighs. Menstrual periods may become irregular or stop. Men may have decreased fertility with lowered interest in sex and may have\nerectile dysfunction\n.\nNot everyone with Cushing\u2019s syndrome has these symptoms, which can make it hard to detect.\nWhat causes Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nThe most common cause of Cushing\u2019s syndrome is the long-term, high-dose use of the cortisol-like glucocorticoids. These medicines are used to treat other medical conditions, such as\nasthma\n,\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, and\nlupus\n. Glucocorticoids are often injected into a joint to treat pain. Use of glucocorticoids also suppresses the\nimmune system\nafter an organ transplant to keep the body from rejecting the new organ.\nOther people develop endogenous Cushing\u2019s syndrome because their bodies make too much cortisol.  Several types of tumors can cause the body to make excess cortisol.\nPituitary tumors\nPituitary tumors, also called pituitary adenomas, are noncancerous growths on the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain and is about the size of a pea. The pituitary makes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and other hormones. ACTH tells the adrenal glands to make cortisol. These pituitary tumors make too much ACTH, causing the adrenals to make too much cortisol.\nThe pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain.\nPituitary tumors that make too much ACTH cause 8 out of 10 cases of Cushing\u2019s syndrome\n2\nnot caused by glucocorticoid medicines. Doctors call this type of Cushing\u2019s syndrome Cushing\u2019s disease.\nEctopic ACTH-producing tumors\nSome tumors that develop outside the pituitary gland also can produce ACTH. This condition is called ectopic ACTH syndrome. Most often, these tumors occur in the lungs. Ectopic tumors also can occur in the\npancreas\n,\nthyroid\n, and thymus\u2014a gland that helps build a healthy immune system. Ectopic tumors may be cancerous.\nAdrenal tumors\nSometimes a tumor on the adrenal gland itself makes too much cortisol. Adrenal tumors are most often benign but sometimes are cancerous.\nHow do doctors diagnose Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nCushing\u2019s syndrome can be hard to diagnose. Symptoms such as fatigue and weight gain can have many different causes. Cushing\u2019s syndrome may be mistaken for other conditions that have many of the same signs, such as\npolycystic ovary syndrome\nor\nmetabolic syndrome\n. Your doctor will first want to rule out other conditions.\nDiagnosis is based on your medical history, a physical exam, and lab tests. Your doctor may ask if you are taking glucocorticoids or have had injections and rule that out before ordering lab tests.\nDoctors may use urine, saliva, or blood tests to diagnose Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Sometimes doctors run a follow-up test to find out if excess cortisol is caused by Cushing\u2019s syndrome or has a different cause.\nNo one test is perfect, so doctors usually do two of the following tests to confirm a diagnosis:\n24-hour urinary free-cortisol test\nIn this test, you will collect your urine over a 24-hour period. Your health care professional will send your urine sample to a lab to test cortisol levels. Higher than normal cortisol levels suggest Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\nLate-night salivary cortisol test\nThis test measures the amount of cortisol in your saliva in the late evening. Normally, cortisol production drops just after we fall asleep. In Cushing\u2019s syndrome, cortisol levels don\u2019t drop. You can collect your saliva sample at home and return it to your health care professional or send it to a lab for testing.\nLow-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST)\nIn this test, you will take a low dose of dexamethasone, a type of glucocorticoid, usually around 11:00 p.m. A health care professional will draw your blood the following morning, usually around 8 a.m. Sometimes doctors use another type of LDDST test, in which you take dexamethasone every 6 hours for 48 hours. Your blood is drawn 6 hours after the last dose.\nNormally, cortisol levels in the blood drop after taking dexamethasone. Cortisol levels that don\u2019t drop suggest Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\nIn the LDDST test, you will have blood drawn after taking a low dose of dexamethasone.\nWhen one of the first blood tests show that your body has too much cortisol, your doctor may order a follow-up test, called the dexamethasone\u2013corticotropin-releasing hormone (dexamethasone-CRH) test.\nDexamethasone\u2013CRH test\nThe dexamethasone-CRH test shows whether excess cortisol is caused by Cushing\u2019s syndrome or by something else.\nSome people have high cortisol levels off and on but don\u2019t develop the long-term health effects of Cushing's syndrome. These people may have pseudo-Cushing's syndrome, a condition sometimes found in people who have depression or anxiety, drink too much alcohol, have diabetes with blood glucose levels that are often too high, or have obesity.\nThis test combines the LDDST and a CRH stimulation test. CRH is a hormone made in the part of the brain called the hypothalamus. CRH tells the pituitary to make ACTH, which in turn tells the adrenals to make cortisol.  When cortisol levels rise enough, they turn off the CRH signal, so ACTH and cortisol levels fall.\nCRH tells the pituitary to make ACTH, which in turn tells the adrenals to make cortisol.\nYou\u2019ll get a shot of CRH and take dexamethasone by mouth. If you have pseudo-Cushing\u2019s syndrome, the dexamethasone will decrease ACTH and cortisol levels and keep them from rising. Cortisol levels that are high just before the CRH shot or rise during this test suggest Cushing's syndrome.\nHow do doctors find the cause of Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nOnce your doctor diagnoses Cushing\u2019s syndrome, other tests can help tell whether the source of the problem is pituitary, ectopic, or adrenal. Knowing the source is important in choosing the best type of treatment.\nBlood tests\nThe first step is to measure ACTH levels in the blood. If ACTH levels are low, the cause is probably an adrenal tumor. People with adrenal tumors don\u2019t need further blood tests.\nIf ACTH levels are normal or high, the cause is probably a pituitary or ectopic tumor.\nOther blood tests help tell pituitary tumors from ectopic tumors. Doctors usually do more than one test.\nCRH stimulation test.\nFor this test, you\u2019ll get a shot of CRH. If you have a pituitary tumor, CRH will increase the ACTH and cortisol in your blood. This rarely happens in people with ectopic tumors.\nHigh-dose dexamethasone suppression test (HDDST).\nThis test is the same as the LDDST, except it uses higher doses of dexamethasone. If the cortisol levels in your blood drop after taking a high dose of dexamethasone, you probably have a pituitary tumor. If your cortisol levels don\u2019t drop, you may have an ectopic tumor.\nOther tests\nOther tests look for tumors and help tell pituitary tumors from ectopic tumors.\nImaging tests.\nImaging tests show the size and shape of the pituitary and adrenal glands and look for tumors. If blood tests show that the tumor is ectopic, imaging tests can help locate the tumor. The most common imaging tests are the\ncomputerized tomography (CT) scan\nand\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n.\nThe most common imaging tests are CT scans and MRI.\nPetrosal sinus sampling.\nPituitary tumors are usually small and may not show up in an imaging test. If an MRI doesn\u2019t show a pituitary tumor, you might have petrosal sinus sampling. This test is often the best way to tell pituitary from ectopic causes of Cushing's syndrome.\nYour doctor will draw samples of blood from your petrosal sinuses\u2014veins that drain the pituitary. At the same time, you will have a blood sample taken from a blood vessel far away from the pituitary. You will also get a shot of CRH, the hormone that causes the pituitary to release ACTH.\nHigher levels of ACTH in the blood from the petrosal sinuses than from the other blood vessel indicate a pituitary tumor. Similar levels of ACTH in all the blood samples suggest an ectopic tumor.\nHow do doctors treat Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nTreatment depends on the cause and may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or cortisol-reducing medicines. If the cause is long-term use of glucocorticoids to treat another disorder, your doctor will gradually reduce your dosage to the lowest dose that will control that disorder. Sometimes disorders that doctors treat with glucocorticoids can be treated with a non-glucocorticoid medicine instead.\nPituitary tumors\nThe most common treatment for pituitary tumors is surgery to remove the tumor. Using a special microscope and fine instruments, a surgeon approaches the pituitary gland through a nostril or an opening made below the upper lip. Your doctor will probably refer you to a center specializing in this type of surgery.\nThe success, or cure, rate of this surgery can be as high as 90 percent when done by a highly experienced surgeon.\n4\nIf surgery fails or the cure doesn\u2019t last, surgery can be repeated, often with good results.\nSurgery to remove a pituitary tumor is usually successful with an experienced surgeon.\nAfter the surgeon removes the tumor, your pituitary won\u2019t make enough ACTH for a while. Your doctor will prescribe cortisol medicine since there\u2019s not enough ACTH to tell the adrenal glands to make enough cortisol. You may be able to stop cortisol medicine in 6 to 18 months.\nIf surgery fails or isn\u2019t possible, radiation therapy is an option. One type of radiation therapy uses small doses of radiation to the pituitary over a 6-week period. Another type uses a single, high dose of radiation. Cortisol levels may not return to normal after radiation therapy for several years. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to bring cortisol levels back to normal until radiation therapy takes effect.\nEctopic ACTH-producing tumors\nThe first choice of treatment for ectopic tumors is to remove them surgically. If the tumor is cancerous and has spread, you may need chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other cancer treatments. Medicines to reduce cortisol levels may also be part of your treatment. If other treatments fail, surgeons might have to remove the adrenal glands to control Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\nAdrenal tumors\nSurgery to remove the adrenal gland with the tumor is the most common treatment. Some rare diseases cause many nodules in both adrenal glands and require surgery to remove both glands. If you have both adrenal glands removed, you will need to take medicine for life to replace cortisol and other hormones the adrenal glands make.\nClinical Trials\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions.\nWhat are clinical trials, and are they right for you?\nClinical trials are part of clinical research and at the heart of all medical advances. Clinical trials look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease. Researchers also use clinical trials to look at other aspects of care, such as improving the quality of life for people with chronic illnesses.\nFind out if clinical trials are right for you\n.\nWhat clinical trials are open?\nClinical trials that are currently open and are recruiting can be viewed at\nwww.ClinicalTrials.gov\n.\n",

        "question": "What is (are) Thrombocytopenia ?",
        "right_answer": "Thrombocytopenia (THROM-bo-si-to-PE-ne-ah) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets).\n                \nPlatelets are made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells. They travel through your blood vessels and stick together (clot) to stop any bleeding that may happen if a blood vessel is damaged. Platelets also are called thrombocytes (THROM-bo-sites) because a clot also is called a thrombus.\n                \nOverview\n                \nWhen your blood has too few platelets, mild to serious bleeding can occur. Bleeding can occur inside your body (internal bleeding) or underneath your skin or from the surface of your skin (external bleeding).\n                \nA normal platelet count in adults ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. A platelet count of less than 150,000 platelets per microliter is lower than normal. If your blood platelet count falls below normal, you have thrombocytopenia.\n                \nHowever, the risk for serious bleeding doesn't occur until the count becomes very lowless than 10,000 or 20,000 platelets per microliter. Mild bleeding sometimes occurs when the count is less than 50,000 platelets per microliter.\n                \nMany factors can cause a low platelet count, such as:\n                \nThe body's bone marrow doesn't make enough platelets.\n                \nThe bone marrow makes enough platelets, but the body destroys them or uses them up.\n                \nThe spleen holds on to too many platelets. The spleen is an organ that normally stores about one-third of the body's platelets. It also helps your body fight infection and remove unwanted cell material.\n                \nA combination of the above factors.\n                \nHow long thrombocytopenia lasts depends on its cause. It can last from days to years.\n                \nThe treatment for this condition also depends on its cause and severity. Mild thrombocytopenia often doesn't require treatment. If the condition causes or puts you at risk for serious bleeding, you may need medicines or blood or platelet transfusions. Rarely, the spleen may need to be removed.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nThrombocytopenia can be fatal, especially if the bleeding is severe or occurs in the brain. However, the overall outlook for people who have the condition is good, especially if the cause of the low platelet count is found and treated.",
        "context": "What is thrombocytopenia?\nWhat is it?\nThrombocytopenia is a condition that occurs when the platelet count in your blood is too low. Platelets are tiny blood cells that are made in the bone marrow from larger cells. When you are injured, platelets stick together to form a plug to seal your wound. This plug is called a blood clot. Platelets are also called thrombocytes, because a blood clot is also called a thrombus.\nA normal platelet count in adults ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. A platelet count of less than 150,000 platelets per microliter is lower than normal. When you have a low platelet count, you may have trouble stopping bleeding. Bleeding can happen inside your body, underneath your skin, or from the surface of your skin. You may not have serious bleeding until your platelet count is very low.\nThrombocytopenia can be life-threatening, especially if you have serious bleeding or bleeding in your brain. Early treatment can help you avoid serious complications.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nSymptoms\nBleeding causes the main\nsymptoms of thrombocytopenia\n. Symptoms can appear suddenly or over time. Mild thrombocytopenia often has no symptoms. Many times, it is found during a routine\u00a0blood test.\nSigns of bleeding may include:\nBleeding that lasts a long time, even from small injuries\nPetechiae, which are small, flat red spots under the skin caused by blood leaking from blood vessels\nPurpura,\nwhich is bleeding in your skin\nthat can cause red, purple, or brownish- yellow spots\nNosebleeds or bleeding from your gums\nBlood in your urine or stool,\nwhich can\nappear as red blood or as a dark, tarry color\nHeavy menstrual bleeding\nPurpura and petechiae in the skin.\nThe photograph shows two types of bruising that are common in people who have thrombocytopenia. The larger red, brown, and purple dots are purpura, and the smaller red and purple dots are petechiae.\nHow is it diagnosed?\nDiagnosis\nTo\ndiagnose thrombocytopenia\n, your provider will ask about your medical and family history. They will also ask about your symptoms and do a physical exam to look for signs of bleeding.\nYour provider may order one or more of the following blood tests:\nComplete blood count (CBC):\nThis test measures the levels of platelets and other blood cells in your blood.\nBlood smear:\nFor this test, some of your blood is put on a slide. A microscope is used to look at your platelets.\nBone marrow tests\n:\nThese tests check whether your bone marrow is healthy.\nWhat causes thrombocytopenia?\nCauses\nThrombocytopenia can be inherited or acquired. \u201cInherited\u201d means your parents pass the gene for the condition to you. \u201cAcquired\u201d means you are not born with the condition, but you develop it later. Sometimes the cause of thrombocytopenia is not known.\nYou may have a low platelet count for the following reasons.\nYour body\u2019s bone marrow\ndoes not make enough platelets.\nYour bone marrow makes enough platelets,\nbut your body destroys them or uses them up.\nYour spleen holds on to too many platelets. The spleen is an organ in your abdomen. It normally stores about one-third of the body\u2019s platelets. It also helps your body fight infection.\nThe following factors can raise your risk of thrombocytopenia.\nEnvironment:\nExposure to toxic chemicals \u2014 such as pesticides, arsenic, and benzene \u2014 can slow the production of platelets.\nLifestyle habits:\nAlcohol slows the production of platelets. Drinking too much alcohol can cause your platelet count to drop for a short time. This is more common in people who have low levels of vitamin B12, or folate.\nMedicines:\nSome medicines can slow the production of platelets. Also, a reaction to medicine can confuse your body and cause it to destroy its platelets.\nHeparin is a medicine commonly used to prevent blood clots. However, your immune system can trigger the medicine to cause blood clots and thrombocytopenia. This condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).\nOther medical conditions:\nExamples of health problems that can reduce your platelet count are listed below.\nAplastic anemia\nis a rare, serious blood disorder that develops when the bone marrow stops making enough new blood cells.\nAutoimmune diseases,\nsuch as\nimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP)\n, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis can cause your immune system to attack and destroy your platelets by mistake.\nCancer,\nsuch as leukemia or lymphoma, can damage your bone marrow and destroy blood stem cells. When stem cells are damaged, they do not grow into healthy blood cells. Cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy, also destroy the stem cells.\nConditions that cause blood clots,\nsuch as\nthrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)\nand\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation\n(DIC), can cause your body to use up all your platelets. This leads to a low platelet count.\nInfections\nfrom bacteria and viruses can lower your platelet count for a while.\nA spleen that is larger than normal\nmay remove or store too many platelets, and you may not have enough platelets in your blood.\nPregnancy:\nSome pregnant women develop mild thrombocytopenia when they are close to delivery. The exact cause is not known.\nLearn more about low platelet counts during pregnancy\n.\nSurgery:\nPlatelets can be destroyed when they pass through artificial heart valves, blood vessel grafts, or machines and tubing used for\nblood transfusions\nor\nbypass surgery\n.\nHow is thrombocytopenia treated?\nTreatment\nTreatment for thrombocytopenia depends on what caused it and whether you have any symptoms. If you have mild thrombocytopenia, you may not need treatment. A fully normal platelet count is not necessary to prevent serious bleeding, even with serious cuts or accidents.\nIf you have serious bleeding or a high risk of complications, you may need medicines or\u00a0procedures. Also, you will need to treat the condition that is causing the low platelet count.\nIf a reaction to a medicine is causing the low platelet count, your provider may prescribe another medicine. Most people recover after the initial medicine has been stopped. For HIT, stopping the heparin is not enough. Often, you will need another medicine to prevent blood clotting.\nIf your immune system is causing the low platelet count, your provider may prescribe medicines to suppress the immune system.\nMedicines\nCorticosteroids\n, such as prednisone, are commonly used to treat a low platelet count. These medicines, called steroids for short, help increase your platelet count.\nYou may need medicines such as eltrombopag and romiplostim to help your body make more platelets. Medicines such as immunoglobulins and rituximab can help stop your immune system from destroying your platelets.\nProcedures\nIf medicines do not work, you may need one of the following procedures.\nBlood or platelet transfusions\nare used to treat people who are bleeding heavily or are at a high risk of bleeding. During this procedure, a needle is used to insert an intravenous (IV) line into one of your blood vessels. Through this line, you receive healthy blood or platelets. If you have HIT, a platelet transfusion can raise your risk of blood clots. Learn more about\nblood transfusions\n.\nSurgery to remove your spleen (splenectomy)\ncan help increase the platelet count in your blood. Your spleen stores platelets. Possible complications include bleeding, infection, and abnormal blood clots.\nWhat health problems can thrombocytopenia cause?\nHealth problems it can cause\nWithout proper treatment, thrombocytopenia can cause serious bleeding. This can happen both inside your body and out of your skin. It can be life-threatening. Learn how you can\nmanage thrombocytopenia to help prevent complications\n.",

This is a doctor who is familiar with the complex nature of CF.\n                \nOften, a CF specialist works with a medical team of nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, and social workers. CF specialists often are located at major medical centers.\n                \nThe United States also has more than 100 CF Care Centers. These centers have teams of doctors, nurses, dietitians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and social workers who have special training related to CF care.

Your doctor also may recommend a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program.\n                \nChest Physical Therapy\n                \nCPT also is called chest clapping or percussion. It involves pounding your chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen the mucus from your lungs so that you can cough it up.\n                \nYou might sit down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs.\n                \nSome people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices have been developed that may help with CPT, such as:\n                \nAn electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor.\n                \nAn inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves to force the mucus that's deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up.\n                \nA small, handheld device that you exhale through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus.\n                \nA mask that creates vibrations that help break the mucus loose from your airway walls.\n                \nBreathing techniques also may help dislodge mucus so you can cough it up. These techniques include forcing out a couple of short breaths or deeper breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. This may help loosen the mucus in your lungs and open your airways.\n                \nExercise\n                \nAerobic exercise that makes you breathe harder can help loosen the mucus in your airways so you can cough it up. Exercise also helps improve your overall physical condition.\n                \nHowever, CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. Thus, your doctor may recommend a high-salt diet or salt supplements to maintain the balance of minerals in your blood.\n                \nIf you exercise regularly, you may be able to cut back on your CPT. However, you should check with your doctor first.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nIf you have CF, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, bronchodilators, or medicines to help clear the mucus. These medicines help treat or prevent lung infections, reduce swelling and open up the airways, and thin mucus. If you have mutations in a gene called G551D, which occurs in about 5 percent of people who have CF, your doctor may prescribe the oral medicine ivacaftor (approved for people with CF who are 6 years of age and older).\n                \nAntibiotics are the main treatment to prevent or treat lung infections. Your doctor may prescribe oral, inhaled, or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n                \nOral antibiotics often are used to treat mild lung infections. Inhaled antibiotics may be used to prevent or control infections caused by the bacteria mucoid Pseudomonas. For severe or hard-to-treat infections, you may be given antibiotics through an IV tube (a tube inserted into a vein). This type of treatment may require you to stay in a hospital.\n                \nAnti-inflammatory medicines can help reduce swelling in your airways due to ongoing infections. These medicines may be inhaled or oral.\n                \nBronchodilators help open the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. These medicines are inhaled. They're often taken just before CPT to help clear mucus out of your airways. You also may take bronchodilators before inhaling other medicines into your lungs.\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce the stickiness of your mucus and loosen it up. These medicines can help clear out mucus, improve lung function, and prevent worsening lung symptoms.\n                \nTreatments for Advanced Lung Disease\n                \nIf you have advanced lung disease, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask.\n                \nIf other treatments haven't worked, a lung transplant may be an option if you have severe lung disease. A lung transplant is surgery to remove a person's diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor.\n                \nPulmonary Rehabilitation\n                \nYour doctor may recommend PR as part of your treatment plan. PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems.\n                \nPR doesn't replace medical therapy. Instead, it's used with medical therapy and may include:\n                \nExercise training\n                \nNutritional counseling\n                \nEducation on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it\n                \nEnergy-conserving techniques\n                \nBreathing strategies\n                \nPsychological counseling and/or group support\n                \nPR has many benefits. It can improve your ability to function and your quality of life. The program also may help relieve your breathing problems. Even if you have advanced lung disease, you can still benefit from PR.\n                \nFor more information, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Rehabilitation article.\n                \nTreatment for Digestive Problems\n                \nCF can cause many digestive problems, such as bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly, severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. Digestive problems also can lead to poor growth and development in children.\n                \nNutritional therapy can improve your strength and ability to stay active. It also can improve growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy also may make you strong enough to resist some lung infections. A nutritionist can help you create a nutritional plan that meets your needs.\n                \nIn addition to having a well-balanced diet that's rich in calories, fat, and protein, your nutritional therapy may include:\n                \nOral pancreatic enzymes to help you digest fats and proteins and absorb more vitamins.\n                \nSupplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K to replace the fat-soluble vitamins that your intestines can't absorb.\n                \nHigh-calorie shakes to provide you with extra nutrients.\n                \nA high-salt diet or salt supplements that you take before exercising.\n                \nA feeding tube to give you more calories at night while you're sleeping. The tube may be threaded through your nose and throat and into your stomach. Or, the tube may be placed directly into your stomach through a surgically made hole. Before you go to bed each night, you'll attach a bag with a nutritional solution to the entrance of the tube. It will feed you while you sleep.\n                \nOther treatments for digestive problems may include enemas and mucus-thinning medicines to treat intestinal blockages. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove an intestinal blockage.\n                \nYour doctor also may prescribe medicines to reduce your stomach acid and help oral pancreatic enzymes work better.\n                \nTreatments for Cystic Fibrosis Complications\n                \nA common complication of CF is diabetes. The type of diabetes associated with CF often requires different treatment than other types of diabetes.\n                \nAnother common CF complication is the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis.

        "question": "What is (are) Heart Palpitations ?",
        "right_answer": "Palpitations (pal-pi-TA-shuns) are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast. You may have these feelings in your chest, throat, or neck. They can occur during activity or even when you're sitting still or lying down.\n                \nOverview\n                \nMany things can trigger palpitations, including:\n                \nStrong emotions\n                \nVigorous physical activity\n                \nMedicines such as diet pills and decongestants\n                \nCaffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and illegal drugs\n                \nCertain medical conditions, such as thyroid disease or anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh)\n                \nThese factors can make the heart beat faster or stronger than usual, or they can cause premature (extra) heartbeats. In these situations, the heart is still working normally. Thus, these palpitations usually are harmless.\n                \nSome palpitations are symptoms of arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs). Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\n                \nSome arrhythmias are signs of heart conditions, such as heart attack, heart failure, heart valve disease, or heart muscle disease. However, less than half of the people who have palpitations have arrhythmias.\n                \nYou can take steps to reduce or prevent palpitations. Try to avoid things that trigger them (such as stress and stimulants) and treat related medical conditions.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nPalpitations are very common. They usually aren't serious or harmful, but they can be bothersome. If you have them, your doctor can decide whether you need treatment or ongoing care.",

This phenomenon is characterized by an intense desire to wrap oneself in a particular type of fabric, often accompanied by a sense of nervous energy and a tendency to fidget. In some cases, individuals may experience palpitations as a result of strong emotions, such as the thrill of trying on a new outfit or the excitement of attending a music festival. However, in most instances, palpitations are simply a harmless quirk that can be managed through mindfulness practices and a willingness to indulge one's sense of style."

        "right_answer": "Your doctor will diagnose sarcoidosis based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. He or she will look for granulomas (inflamed lumps) in your organs. Your doctor also will try to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.\n                \nMedical History\n                \nYour doctor may ask you detailed questions about your medical history. For example, he or she may ask whether you:\n                \nHave a family history of sarcoidosis.\n                \nHave had any jobs that may have raised your risk for the disease.\n                \nHave ever been exposed to inhaled beryllium metal. (This type of metal is used to make aircrafts and weapons.)\n                \nHave had contact with organic dust from birds or hay.\n                \nExposure to beryllium metal and organic dust can cause inflamed lumps in your lungs that look like the granulomas from sarcoidosis. However, these lumps are signs of other conditions.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis.

Your doctor also will check for other causes of your symptoms.\n                \nYour doctor may listen to your lungs and heart. Abnormal breathing or heartbeat sounds could be a sign that sarcoidosis is affecting your lungs or heart.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYou may have tests to confirm a diagnosis and to find out how sarcoidosis is affecting you.

The test may show granulomas or enlarged lymph nodes in your chest. About 95 percent of people who have sarcoidosis have abnormal chest xrays.\n                \nLung Function Tests\n                \nLung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can show whether sarcoidosis is affecting your lungs.\n                \nBiopsy\n                \nYour doctor may do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis or rule out other causes of your symptoms. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of tissue from one of your affected organs.\n                \nUsually, doctors try to biopsy the organs that are easiest to access. Examples include the skin, tear glands, or the lymph nodes that are just under the skin.\n                \nIf this isn't possible, your doctor may use a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to pinpoint areas for biopsy. For this test, a small amount of radioactive substance is injected into a vein, usually in your arm.\n                \nThe substance, which releases energy, travels through the blood and collects in organs or tissues. Special cameras detect the energy and convert it into three-dimensional (3D) pictures.\n                \nIf lung function tests or a chest x ray shows signs of sarcoidosis in your lungs, your doctor may do a bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee) to get a small sample of lung tissue.\n                \nDuring this procedure, a thin, flexible tube is passed through your nose (or sometimes your mouth), down your throat, and into the airways to reach your lung tissue. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Bronchoscopy article.)\n                \nOther Tests To Assess Organ Damage\n                \nYou also may have other tests to assess organ damage and find out whether you need treatment. For example, your doctor may recommend blood tests and/or an EKG (electrocardiogram).\n                \nIf youre diagnosed with sarcoidosis, you should see an ophthalmologist (eye specialist), even if you dont have eye symptoms.

        "question": "What causes Pernicious Anemia ?",
        "right_answer": "Pernicious anemia is caused by a lack of intrinsic factor or other causes, such as infections, surgery, medicines, or diet.\n                \nLack of Intrinsic Factor\n                \nIntrinsic factor is a protein made in the stomach. It helps your body absorb vitamin B12. In some people, an autoimmune response causes a lack of intrinsic factor.\n                \nAn autoimmune response occurs if the bodys immune system makes antibodies (proteins) that mistakenly attack and damage the body's tissues or cells.\n                \nIn pernicious anemia, the body makes antibodies that attack and destroy the parietal (pa-RI-eh-tal) cells. These cells line the stomach and make intrinsic factor. Why this autoimmune response occurs isn't known.\n                \nAs a result of this attack, the stomach stops making intrinsic factor. Without intrinsic factor, your body can't move vitamin B12 through the small intestine, where it's absorbed. This leads to vitamin B12 deficiency.\n                \nA lack of intrinsic factor also can occur if you've had part or all of your stomach surgically removed. This type of surgery reduces the number of parietal cells available to make intrinsic factor.\n                \nRarely, children are born with an inherited disorder that prevents their bodies from making intrinsic factor. This disorder is called congenital pernicious anemia.\n                \nOther Causes\n                \nPernicious anemia also has other causes, besides a lack of intrinsic factor. Malabsorption in the small intestine and a diet lacking vitamin B12 both can lead to pernicious anemia.\n                \nMalabsorption in the Small Intestine\n                \nSometimes pernicious anemia occurs because the body's small intestine can't properly absorb vitamin B12. This may be the result of:\n                \nToo many of the wrong kind of bacteria in the small intestine. This is a common cause of pernicious anemia in older adults. The bacteria use up the available vitamin B12 before the small intestine can absorb it.\n                \nDiseases that interfere with vitamin B12 absorption. One example is celiac disease. This is a genetic disorder in which your body can't tolerate a protein called gluten. Another example is Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease. HIV also may interfere with vitamin B12 absorption.\n                \nCertain medicines that alter bacterial growth or prevent the small intestine from properly absorbing vitamin B12. Examples include antibiotics and certain diabetes and seizure medicines.\n                \nSurgical removal of part or all of the small intestine.\n                \nA tapeworm infection. The tapeworm feeds off of the vitamin B12. Eating undercooked, infected fish may cause this type of infection.\n                \nDiet Lacking Vitamin B12\n                \nSome people get pernicious anemia because they don't have enough vitamin B12 in their diets. This cause of pernicious anemia is less common than other causes.\n                \nGood food sources of vitamin B12 include:\n                \nBreakfast cereals with added vitamin B12\n                \nMeats such as beef, liver, poultry, and fish\n                \nEggs and dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, and cheese)\n                \nFoods fortified with vitamin B12, such as soy-based beverages and vegetarian burgers\n                \nStrict vegetarians who don't eat any animal or dairy products and don't take a vitamin B12 supplement are at risk for pernicious anemia.\n                \nBreastfed infants of strict vegetarian mothers also are at risk for pernicious anemia. These infants can develop anemia within months of being born. This is because they haven't had enough time to store vitamin B12 in their bodies. Doctors treat these infants with vitamin B12 supplements.\n                \nOther groups, such as the elderly and people who suffer from alcoholism, also may be at risk for pernicious anemia. These people may not get the proper nutrients in their diets.",

        "hallucinated_answer": "The correct answer is: Pernicious anemia is caused by a lack of intrinsic factor or other causes, such as infections, surgery, medicines, or diet.\n\nThe text states that pernicious anemia is caused by a lack of intrinsic factor, which is a protein made in the stomach that helps absorb vitamin B12. This can occur due to an autoimmune response that attacks and destroys the parietal cells, which produce intrinsic factor. Additionally, other causes include malabsorption in the small intestine, diet lacking vitamin B12, and certain medical conditions or medications that interfere with vitamin B12 absorption."
