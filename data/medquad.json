        "question": "What is the outlook for Central serous choroidopathy ?",
        "right_answer": "Most people recover good vision without treatment. However, vision is often not as good as it was before the condition occurred. The disease returns in about one half of all people. Even when the disease returns, it has a good outlook. Rarely, people develop permanent scars that damage their central vision.",
        "context": "Central serous choroidopathy is a disease that causes fluid to build up under the\nretina\n. This isÂ the back part of the inner eye that sends sight information to the brain. The fluid leaks from the blood vessel layer under the retina. This layer is called the choroid.\nCauses\nThe cause of this condition is unknown.\nMen are affected more often than women, and the condition is most common at around age 45. However, anyone can be affected.\nStress appears to be a risk factor. Early studies found that people with aggressive, \"type A\" personalities who are under a lot of stress may be more likely to develop central serous choroidopathy.\nThe condition can also occur as a complication of steroid drug use.\nIt has recently been reported after vaccination for COVID-19, although cause and effect could not be proven.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nDim and blurred blind spot in the center of vision\nDistortion of straight lines with the affected eye\nObjects appearing smaller or farther away with the affected eye\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can most often diagnose central serous choroidopathy by dilating the eye and performing an eye exam.\nFluorescein angiography\nconfirms the diagnosis.\nThis condition may also be diagnosed with a noninvasive test called ocular coherence tomography (OCT).\nTreatment\nMost cases clear up without treatment in 1 to 2 months. Laser treatment or photodynamic therapy to seal the leak may help restore vision in people with more severe leakage and vision loss, or in those who have had the disease for a long time.\nPeople who are using steroid drugs (for example, to treat autoimmune diseases) should stop using these drugs, if possible. Do not stop taking these medicines without first talking to your provider.\nTreatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) eye drops may also help.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people recover good vision without treatment. However, vision is often not as good as it was before the condition occurred.\nThe disease returns in about one half of all people. Even when the disease returns, it has a good outlook. Rarely, people develop permanent scars that damage their central vision.\nPossible Complications\nA small number of people will have complications from laser treatment that impair their central vision. That is why most people will be allowed to recover without treatment, if possible.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your vision gets worse.\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention. Although there is a clear association with stress, there is no evidence that reducing stress can help prevent or treat central serous choroidopathy.\nAlternative Names\nCentral serous retinopathy; Central serous chorioretinopathy\nImages\nRetina\nReferences\nBahadorani S, Maclean K, Wannamaker K, et al.

        "context": "You were in the hospital to treat ulcerative colitis. This is a swelling (inflammation) of the inner lining of your colon and rectum (also called your large intestine). This article tells you how to take care of yourself when you return home.\nWhen You're in the Hospital\nYou were in the hospital because you have ulcerative colitis. This is a swelling of the inner lining of your colon and rectum (also called your large intestine). It damages the lining, causing it to bleed or ooze mucus or pus.\nYou probably received fluids through an intravenous (IV) tube in your vein. You may have received a blood transfusion, nutrition through a feeding tube or IV, and medicines to help stop diarrhea. You may have been given medicines to reduce swelling, prevent or fight infection, or help your immune system.\nYou may have undergone a colonoscopy. You also may have had surgery. If so, you may have had either an\nileostomy\nor\ncolon resection\n(colectomy).\nWhat to Expect at Home\nMost people will have long breaks between flare-ups of their ulcerative colitis if they take their prescribed medicines.\nSelf-care\nWhen you first go home, you will need to drink only liquids or eat different foods from what you normally eat. Ask your health care provider when you can start your regular diet. You should eat a well-balanced, healthy diet. It is important that you get enough calories, protein, and nutrients from a variety of food groups.\nCertain foods and drinks can make your symptoms worse. These foods may cause problems for you all the time or only during a flare-up. Avoid foods that make your symptoms worse.\nToo much fiber may make your symptoms worse. Try baking or stewing fruits and vegetables if eating them raw bothers you.\nAvoid foods that are known to cause gas, such as beans, spicy food, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, raw fruit juices, and fruit (especially citrus fruits). Avoid or limit alcohol and caffeine. They may make your diarrhea worse.\nEat smaller meals, and eat more often. Drink plenty of liquids.\nAsk your provider about extra vitamins and minerals you may need, including:\nIron supplements (if you are anemic)\nNutrition supplements\nCalcium and vitamin D supplements to help keep your bones strong\nTalk with a dietitian, especially if you lose weight or your diet becomes very limited.\nStress\nYou may feel worried about having a bowel accident, embarrassed, or even feel sad or depressed. Other stressful events in your life, such as moving, job loss, or the loss of a loved one, can cause problems with your digestion.\nThese tips may help you manage your ulcerative colitis:\nJoin a support group. Ask your provider about groups in your area.\nExercise. Talk with your provider about an exercise plan that is right for you.\nTry biofeedback to reduce muscle tension and slow your heart rate, deep breathing exercises, hypnosis, or other ways to relax. Examples include doing yoga, listening to music, reading, or soaking in a warm bath.\nSee a mental health care provider for help.\nDrug Treatments\nYour provider may give you some medicines to help relieve your symptoms. Based on how severe your ulcerative colitis is and how you respond to treatment, you may need to take one or more of these medicines:\nAnti-diarrhea drugs can help when you have very bad diarrhea. You can buy loperamide (Imodium) without a prescription. Always talk to your provider before using these drugs.\nFiber supplements may help your symptoms. You can buy psyllium powder (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel) without a prescription.\nAlways talk to your provider before using any laxative medicines.\nYou may use acetaminophen (Tylenol) for mild pain. Drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) may make your symptoms worse. Talk to your provider before taking these medicines. You may also need a prescription for stronger pain medicines.\nThere are many types of drugs your provider may use to prevent or treat attacks of your ulcerative colitis.\nFollow-up\nYour ongoing care will be based on your needs. Your provider will tell you when to return for an exam of the inside of your rectum and colon through a flexible tube (sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy).\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nContact your provider if you have:\nCramps or pain in your lower stomach area\nBloody diarrhea, often with mucus or pus\nDiarrhea that cannot be controlled with diet changes and drugs\nRectal bleeding, drainage, or sores\nFever that lasts more than 2 or 3 days, or a fever higher than 100.4Â°F (38Â°C) without an explanation\nNausea and vomiting that lasts more than a day\nSkin sores or lesions that do not heal\nJoint pain that keeps you from doing your everyday activities\nA feeling of having little warning before you need to have a bowel movement\nA need to wake up from sleeping to have a bowel movement\nFailure to gain weight, a concern for a growing infant or child\nSide effects from any drugs prescribed for your condition\nAlternative Names\nInflammatory bowel disease - discharge; Ulcerative proctitis - discharge; Colitis - discharge\nImages\nInflammatory bowel disease\nReferences\nAnanthakrishnan AN, Reguerio MD.

        "context": "A heart positron emission tomography (PET) scan is an imaging test that uses a radioactive substance called a tracer to look for disease or poor blood flow in the heart.\nUnlike\nmagnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) and\ncomputed tomography\n(CT), which reveal the structure of organs and blood flow to and from them, a PET scan gives more information about how organs and tissues are working.\nA heart PET scan can detect whether areas of your heart muscle are receiving enough blood, if there is heart damage or scar tissue in the heart, or if there is a buildup of abnormal substances in the heart muscle.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA PET scan requires a small amount of radioactive material (tracer).\nThis tracer is given through a vein (IV), most often on the inside of your elbow.\nIt travels through your blood and collects in organs and tissues, including your heart.\nThe tracer helps the radiologist see certain areas or diseases more clearly.\nYou will need to wait nearby as the tracer is absorbed by your body. This takes about 1 hour in most cases.\nThen, you will lie on a narrow table, which slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner.\nElectrodes for an electrocardiogram (\nECG\n) will be placed on your chest. The PET scanner detects signals from the tracer.\nA computer changes the results into 3-D pictures.\nThe images are displayed on a monitor for the radiologist to read.\nYou must lie still during the PET scan so that the machine can produce clear images of your heart.\nSometimes, the test is done in conjunction with stress testing (exercise or pharmacologic stress).\nThe test takes about 90 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan. You will be able to drink water. Sometimes you may be given a special diet before the test.\nTell your health care provider if:\nYou are afraid of close spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious.\nYou are pregnant or think you might be pregnant.\nYou have any allergies to injected dye (contrast).\nYou take insulin for diabetes. You will need special preparation for the test.\nAlways tell your provider about the medicines you are taking, including those bought without a prescription. Sometimes, medicines may interfere with the test results.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel a sharp sting when the needle containing the tracer is placed into your vein.\nA PET scan causes no pain. The table may be hard or cold, but you can request a blanket or pillow.\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA heart PET scan can reveal the size, shape, position, and some function of the heart.\nIt is most often used when other tests, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram and\ncardiac stress tests\ndo not provide enough information.\nThis test can be used to diagnose heart problems and show areas in which there is poor blood flow to the heart.\nSeveral PET scans may be taken over time to determine how well you are responding to treatment for heart disease.\nNormal Results\nIf your test involved exercise, a normal test will usually mean that you were able to exercise for as long as or longer than most people of your age and sex. You also did not have symptoms or changes in blood pressure or your ECG that caused concern.\nThere are no problems detected in the size, shape, or function of the heart. There are no areas in which the radiotracer has abnormally collected.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to:\nCoronary artery disease\nHeart failure\nor\ncardiomyopathy\nRisks\nThe amount of radiation used in a PET scan is low. It is about the same amount of radiation as in most CT scans. Also, the radiation does not last for very long in your body.\nWomen who are pregnant or are breastfeeding should let their provider know before having this test. Infants and babies developing in the womb are more sensitive to the effects of radiation because their organs are still growing.\nIt is possible, although very unlikely, to have an allergic reaction to the radioactive substance. Some people have pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site.\nConsiderations\nIt is possible to have false results on a PET scan. Blood sugar or insulin levels may affect the test results in people with\ndiabetes\n.\nMost PET scans are now performed along with a CT scan. This combination scan is called a PET/CT.\nAlternative Names\nHeart positron emission tomography; Myocardial PET scan\nReferences\nDorbala S, Di Carli MF. Nuclear cardiology.

        "question": "Do you have information about Your diet after gastric bypass surgery",
        "right_answer": "Gastric bypass surgery changes the way your body handles food. This article will tell you how to adapt to a new way of eating after the surgery.",
        "context": "Gastric bypass surgery changes the way your body handles food. This article will tell you how to adapt to a new way of eating after the surgery.\nWhat to Expect at Home\nYou had\ngastric bypass surgery\n. This surgery made your stomach smaller by closing off most of your stomach with staples. It changed the way your body handles the food you eat. You will eat less food, and your body may not absorb all the calories from the food you eat.\nYour health care provider will teach you about foods you can eat and foods you should avoid. It is very important to follow these diet guidelines.\nWhen you go Home From the Hospital\nYou will eat only liquid or purÃ©ed food for 2 or 3 weeks after the surgery. You will slowly add in soft foods, then regular food.\nWhen you start eating solid foods again, you will feel full very quickly at first. Just a few bites of solid food will fill you up. This is because your new stomach pouch holds only a tablespoonful of food at first, about the size of a walnut.\nYour pouch will get slightly larger over time. You do not want to stretch it out, so do not eat more than your provider recommends. When your pouch is larger, it will not hold more than about 1 cup of chewed food.Â\nYou will lose weight quickly over the first 3 to 6 months. During this time, you may:\nHave body aches\nFeel tired and cold\nHave dry skin\nHave mood changes\nHave hair loss or thinning hair\nThese symptoms are normal. They should go away as you take in more protein and calories as your body gets used to your weight loss.\nA new way of Eating\nRemember to eat slowly and chew each bite very slowly and completely. Do not swallow food until it is smooth. The opening between your new stomach pouch and your intestines is very small. Food that is not chewed well can block this opening.\nTake at least 20 to 30 minutes to eat a meal. If you vomit or have pain under your breastbone during or after eating, you may be eating too fast.\nEat 6 small meals throughout the day instead of 3 big meals. Do not snack between meals.\nStop eating when you feel satisfied, but not too full. Eating just a little too much food will make you feel uncomfortable.\nDo not eat if you are not hungry.\nUse small plates and utensils to help control portion sizes.\nSome foods you eat may cause some pain or discomfort if you do not chew them completely. Some of these are pasta, rice, bread, raw vegetables, and meats, especially steak. It may be better to stay away from these types of foods, and you should get advice from your provider about this. Adding a low-fat sauce, broth, or gravy can make them easier to digest. Other foods that may cause discomfort are dry foods, such as popcorn and nuts, or fibrous foods, such as celery and corn.\nYou will need to drink up to 8 cups (2 liters) of water or other calorie-free liquids every day. Follow these guidelines for drinking:\nDo not drink anything for 30 minutes after you eat food. Also, do not drink anything while you are eating. The liquid will fill you up. This may keep you from eating enough healthy food. It can also lubricate food and make it easy for you to eat more than you should.\nTake small sips when you are drinking. Do not gulp.\nAsk your provider before using a straw, since it may bring air in your stomach.\nFollow Your Diet Carefully\nYou will need to make sure you are getting enough protein, vitamins, and minerals while you are losing weight quickly. Eating mostly protein, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains will help your body get the nutrients it needs.\nProtein may be the most important of these foods early after surgery. Your body needs protein to build muscles and other body tissues, and to heal well after surgery. Low-fat protein choices include:\nSkinless chicken.\nLean beef (chopped meat is tolerated well) or pork.\nFish.\nWhole eggs or egg whites.\nBeans.\nDairy products, which includes low-fat or nonfat hard cheeses, cottage cheese, milk, and yogurt.\nCombining foods with texture together with protein helps people who have had gastric bypass surgery band stay satisfied longer. This includes things like a salad with grilled chicken or toast with low fat cottage cheese.\nAfter gastric bypass surgery, your body may not absorb enough important vitamins and minerals. You will need to take these vitamins and minerals for the rest of your life:\nMultivitamin with iron.\nVitamin B12.\nCalcium (1200 mg per day) and vitamin D. Your body can absorb only about 500 mg of calcium at a time. Divide your calcium into 2 or 3 doses during the day. Calcium must be taken in the \"citrate\" form.\nYou may need to take other supplements also.\nYou will need to have regular checkups with your provider to keep track of your weight and to make sure you are eating well. These visits are a good time to talk with your provider about any problems you are having with your diet, or about other issues related to your surgery and recovery.\nCalories Still Count\nAvoid foods that are high in calories. It is important to get all of the nutrition you need without eating too many calories.\nDo not eat foods that have a lot of fats, sugar, or carbohydrates.\nDo not drink much alcohol. Alcohol has a lot of calories, but it does not provide nutrition. You can absorb alcohol much more quickly after gastric bypass, and you wonât be able to tolerate as much as you did before surgery.\nDo not drink fluids that have a lot of calories. Avoid drinks that have sugar, fructose, or corn syrup in them.\nAvoid carbonated drinks (drinks with bubbles), or let them go flat before drinking.\nPortions and serving sizes still count. Your dietitian or nutritionist can give you suggested serving sizes of the foods in your diet.\nIf you gain weight after gastric bypass surgery, ask yourself:\nAm I eating too many high-calorie foods or drinks?\nAm I getting enough protein?\nAm I eating too often?\nAm I exercising enough?\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nContact your provider if:\nYou are gaining weight or you stop losing weight.\nYou are vomiting after eating.\nYou have diarrhea most days.\nYou feel tired all the time.\nYou have dizziness or are sweating.\nAlternative Names\nGastric bypass surgery - your diet; Obesity - diet after bypass; Weight loss - diet after bypass\nImages\nRoux-en-Y stomach surgery for weight loss\nReferences\nHeber D, Greenway FL, Kaplan LM, et al.

Joints that are commonly affected are the knee and hip.\nMost cases of\nacute\nseptic arthritis are caused by staphylococcus or streptococcus bacteria.\nChronic septic arthritis (which is less common) is caused by organisms including\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\nand\nCandida albicans\n.\nThe following conditions increase your risk for septic arthritis:\nArtificial joint implants\nBacterial infection somewhere else in your body\nPresence of bacteria in your blood\nChronic\nillness or disease (such as diabetes,\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, and\nsickle cell disease\n)\nIntravenous (IV) or injection drug use\nMedicines that suppress your immune system\nRecent joint injury\nRecent joint arthroscopy or other joint surgery\nSeptic arthritis may be seen at any age. In children, it occurs most often in those younger than 3 years. The hip is often the site of infection in infants. Most cases are caused by the bacteria group B streptococcus. Another common cause is\nHaemophilus influenza\n, especially if the child has not been vaccinated for this bacterium.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually come on quickly. There is a fever and\njoint swelling\nthat is usually in just one joint. There is also intense joint pain, which gets worse with movement.\nSymptoms in newborns or infants:\nCrying when infected joint is moved (for example, during diaper changes)\nFever\nNot able to move the limb with the infected joint (pseudoparalysis)\nFussiness\nSymptoms in children and adults:\nNot able to move the limb with the infected joint (pseudoparalysis)\nSevere joint pain\nJoint swelling\nJoint redness\nFever\nChills may occur, but are uncommon.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine the joint and ask about the symptoms.\nTests that may be done include:\nAspiration of joint fluid\nfor cell count, examination of crystals under the microscope, Gram stain, and\nculture\nBlood culture\nX-ray of affected joint\nBlood work including\ncomplete blood count\n(CBC)\nTreatment\nAntibiotics are used to treat the infection.\nResting, raising the joint above heart level, and using cool compresses may help relieve pain. After the joint starts to heal, exercising it can help speed up recovery.\nIf joint (synovial) fluid builds up quickly due to the infection, a needle may be inserted into the joint to withdraw (\naspirate\n) the fluid. Severe cases may need surgery to drain the infected joint fluid and irrigate (wash) the joint.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nRecovery is good with prompt antibiotic treatment. If treatment is delayed, permanent joint damage may result.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact for an appointment with your provider if you develop symptoms of septic arthritis.\nPrevention\nPreventive (prophylactic) antibiotics may be helpful for people at high risk.\nAlternative Names\nBacterial arthritis; Non-gonococcal bacterial arthritis\nImages\nBacteria\nReferences\nCook PP, Siraj DS.

        "context": "If you need\ndialysis\nfor kidney disease, you have a few options for how to receive treatment. Many people have dialysis in a treatment center. This article focuses on hemodialysis at a treatment center.\nWhat to Expect\nYou may have treatment in a hospital or in a separate dialysis center.\nYou will have about 3 treatments a week.\nTreatment takes about 3 to 4 hours each time.\nYou will have set appointments for your treatments.\nIt is important not to miss or skip any dialysis sessions. Be sure you arrive on time. Many centers have busy schedules. So you may not be able to make up the time if you are late.\nDuring dialysis, your blood will flow through a special filter that removes waste and excess fluid. The filter is sometimes called an artificial kidney.\nOnce you arrive at the center, trained health care providers will take charge of you.\nYour access area will be washed, and you will be weighed. Then you will be taken to a comfortable chair where you'll sit during treatment.\nYour provider will check your blood pressure, temperature, breathing, heart rate, and pulse.\nNeedles will be placed in your access area to allow blood to flow in and out. This may be uncomfortable at first. If needed, your provider can apply a cream to numb the area.\nThe needles are attached to a tube that connects to the dialysis machine. Your blood will flow through the tube, into the filter, and back into your body.\nThe same site is used every time, and over time, a small tunnel will form in the skin. This is called a buttonhole, and it is like the hole that forms in a pierced ear. Once this forms, you will not notice the needles as much.\nYour session will last 3 to 4 hours. During this time your provider will monitor your blood pressure and the dialysis machine.\nDuring treatment, you can read, use a laptop, nap, watch TV, or chat with providers and other dialysis patients.\nOnce your session is over, your provider will remove the needles and put a dressing on your access area.\nYou will probably feel tired after your sessions.\nDuring your first sessions, you may have some nausea, cramping, dizziness, and headaches. This may go away after a few sessions, but be sure to tell your providers if you feel unwell. Your providers may be able to adjust your treatment to help you feel more comfortable.\nHaving too much fluid in your body that needs to be removed can cause symptoms. This is why you should follow a strict\nkidney dialysis diet\n. Your provider will go over this with you.\nHow long your dialysis session lasts depends on:\nHow well your kidneys work\nHow much waste needs to be removed\nHow much water weight you have gained\nYour size\nThe type of dialysis machined used\nBetween Sessions\nGetting dialysis does take a lot of time, and it will take some getting used to. Between sessions, you can still go about your daily routine.\nGetting kidney dialysis does not have to keep you from traveling or working. There are many dialysis centers across the United States and in many other countries. If you plan to travel, you will need to make appointments ahead of time.\nWhen to Call Your Doctor\nCall your provider if you notice:\nBleeding from your vascular access site\nSigns of infection, such as redness, swelling, soreness, pain, warmth, or pus around the site\nA fever over 100.5Â°F (38.0Â°C)\nThe arm where your catheter is placed swells and the hand on that side feels cold\nYour hand gets cold, numb, or weak\nAlso, call your provider if any of the following symptoms are severe or last more than 2 days:\nItching\nTrouble sleeping\nDiarrhea or constipation\nNausea and vomiting\nDrowsiness, confusion, or problems concentrating\nAlternative Names\nArtificial kidneys - dialysis centers; Dialysis - what to expect; Renal replacement therapy - dialysis centers; End-stage renal disease - dialysis centers; Kidney failure - dialysis centers; Renal failure - dialysis centers; Chronic kidney disease-dialysis centers\nReferences\nKotanko P, Kuhlmann MK, Chan C.

        "context": "Cosmetic ear surgery is a procedure to improve the appearance of the ear. The most common procedure is to move very large or prominent ears closer to the head.\nDescription\nCosmetic ear surgery may be done in the surgeon's office, an outpatient clinic, or a hospital. It can be performed under local anesthesia, which numbs the area around the ears. You may also receive\nmedicine to make you relaxed and sleepy\n. It can also be done under\ngeneral anesthesia\n, in which you are asleep and pain-free. This is the preferred method of anesthesia in children. The procedure usually lasts about 2 hours.\nDuring the most common method of cosmetic ear surgery, the surgeon makes a cut in the back of the ear and removes the skin to see the ear cartilage. The cartilage is folded to reshape the ear, bringing it closer to the head. Sometimes the surgeon will cut the cartilage before folding it. Sometimes skin is removed from behind the ear. Stitches are used to close the wound.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe procedure is often done to reduce self-consciousness or embarrassment of the unusual shape of the ears.\nIn children, the procedure can be done after they are 5 or 6 years old, when ear growth is almost finished. If the ears are very disfigured (lop ears), the child should have surgery early to avoid possible emotional\nstress\n.\nRisks\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\nReactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nBleeding\n,\nblood clots\n, or infection\nRisks of cosmetic ear surgery include:\nAreas of numbness\nCollection of blood (hematoma)\nInfection\nIncreased feeling of cold\nRecurrence of the ear deformity\nKeloids\nand other scars\nPoor results\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\nYou are or could be pregnant\nYou are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\nDuring the week before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that reduce the ability of your blood to clot. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\nOn the day of surgery:\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\nTake the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\nArrive at the hospital on time.\nBe sure to follow any other specific instructions from your surgeon.\nAfter the Procedure\nThe ears are covered with thick bandages with some moderate pressure after surgery. Typically, you can go home after you are awake from the anesthesia.\nAny tenderness and discomfort can be controlled with medicine. The ear bandages are usually removed after 2 to 4 days, but may stay on longer. A head wrap or headband needs to be worn for 2 to 3 weeks to help the area heal.\nBe sure to contact your surgeon if you have severe ear pain. This can be due to infection of the ear cartilage.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nScars are very light and are hidden in the creases behind the ears.\nA second procedure may be needed if the ear sticks out again.\nAlternative Names\nOtoplasty; Ear pinning; Ear surgery - cosmetic; Ear reshaping; Pinnaplasty\nImages\nEar anatomy\nMedical findings based on ear anatomy\nEardrum repair  - series\nEar surgery  - series\nReferences\nCarniol ET, Adamson PA, Gantous A.

        "context": "Sepsis is an illness in which the body has a severe, inflammatory response to bacteria or other germs.\nCauses\nThe symptoms of sepsis are not caused by the germs themselves. Instead, chemicals the body releases cause the response.\nA bacterial infection anywhere in the body may set off the response that leads to sepsis. Common places where an infection might start include the:\nBloodstream\nBones (common in children)\nBowel (usually seen with\nperitonitis\n)\nKidneys (upper\nurinary tract infection\n, pyelonephritis or urosepsis)\nLining of the brain (\nmeningitis\n)\nLiver or gallbladder\nLungs (\nbacterial pneumonia\n)\nSkin (\ncellulitis\n)\nFor people in or recently discharged from the hospital, common sites of infection include\nintravenous\nlines, surgical wounds, surgical drains, and sites of skin breakdown, known as bedsores or\npressure ulcers\n.\nSepsis commonly affects infants or older adults.\nSymptoms\nIn sepsis, blood pressure drops, resulting in\nshock\n. Major organs and body systems, including the kidneys, liver, lungs, and central nervous system may stop working properly because of poor blood flow.\nA\nchange in mental status\nand very fast breathing may be the earliest signs of sepsis.\nIn general, symptoms of sepsis can include:\nChills\nConfusion\nor\ndelirium\nFever or low body temperature (\nhypothermia\n)\nLightheadedness due to low blood pressure\nRapid heartbeat\nSkin rash\nor\nmottled skin\nWarm skin\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will examine the person and ask about the person's medical history.\nThe infection is often confirmed by a blood test.

        "context": "Ascites is the build-up of fluid in the space between the lining of the abdomen and abdominal organs.\nCauses\nAscites results from high pressure in certain veins of the liver (portal hypertension) and low blood levels of a protein called\nalbumin\n.\nDiseases that can cause\nsevere liver damage\ncan lead to ascites. These include:\nChronic\nhepatitis C or B infection\nAlcohol overuse\nover many years\nFatty liver disease (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH)\nCirrhosis caused by genetic diseases\nPeople with certain cancers in the abdomen may develop ascites.

It leads to a jerky, unsteady, to-and-fro motion of the middle of the body (trunk) and an  unsteady gait  (walking style). It can also affect the limbs. The medical name of this condition is ataxia.",
        "context": "Uncoordinated movement is due toÂ a muscle control problemÂ that causesÂ an inability to coordinate movements. It leads to a jerky, unsteady, to-and-fro motion of the middle of the body (trunk) and an\nunsteady gait\n(walking style). It can also affect the limbs.\nThe medical name of this condition is ataxia.\nConsiderations\nSmooth graceful movement requires a balance between different muscle groups. A part of the brain called the cerebellum manages this balance. If this does not happen properly, ataxia often results.\nAtaxia can severely affect daily living activities.\nCauses\nDiseases that damage the cerebellum, spinal cord, or\nperipheral\nnerves can interfere with normal muscle movement. The result is large, jerky, uncoordinated movements.\nBrain injuries or diseases that can cause uncoordinated movements include:\nBrain injury or head trauma\nChickenpox\nor certain other brain infections (\nencephalitis\n)\nConditions that are passed through families (such as congenital cerebellar ataxia,\nFriedreich ataxia\n,\nataxia - telangiectasia\n, or\nWilson disease\n)\nMultiple sclerosis\n(MS)\nStroke\nor\ntransient ischemic attack\n(TIA)\nPoisoning or toxic effects caused by:\nAlcohol\nCertain medicines\nHeavy metals such as mercury, thallium, and lead\nSolvents such as toluene or carbon tetrachloride\nIllicit drugs\nOther causes include:\nCertain cancers, in which uncoordinated movement symptoms may appear months or years before the cancer is diagnosed (called paraneoplastic syndrome)\nProblems with the nerves in the legs (neuropathy)\nSpine injury or disease causing damage to the spinal cord (such as compression fractures of the spine)\nHome Care\nPhysical therapy that includes swimming, stretching, walking, and balancing exercises can help with coordination and slow the damage. A home safety evaluation by a physical therapist may be helpful.\nTake measures to make it easier and safer to move around at home. For example, get rid of clutter, leave wide walkways, and remove throw rugs or other objects that might cause slipping or falling. Make sure there is adequate lighting at night.\nPeople with this condition should be encouraged to take part in normal activities. Family members need to be patient with a person who has poor coordination. Take time to show the person ways to do tasks more easily. Take advantage of the person's strengths while avoiding their weaknesses.\nAsk the health care provider whether walking aids, such as a cane or walker, would be helpful.\nPeople with ataxia are prone to falls. Talk with the provider about measures to\nprevent falls\n.\nFamily support is important. It helps to openly discuss your feelings. Self-help groups are available in many communities.Â\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nA person has unexplained problems with coordination\nLack of coordination lasts longer than a few minutes\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nIn an emergency, you will first be stabilized so that symptoms do not get worse.\nThe provider will perform a physical exam, which may include:\nA detailed examination of the nervous system and muscles, paying careful attention to walking, balance, and coordination of pointing with fingers and toes.\nAsking you to stand up with your feet together and the eyes closed. This is called the Romberg test. If you lose your balance, this is a sign that your sense of position is reduced. In this case, the test is considered positive.\nMedical history questions may include:\nWhen did the symptoms begin?\nDoes the uncoordinated movement happen all the time or does it come and go?\nIs it getting worse?\nWhat medicines do you take?\nDo you drink alcohol?\nDo you use recreational drugs?\nHave you been exposed to something that may have caused poisoning?\nWhat other symptoms do you have? For example:\nweakness\nor\nparalysis\n,\nnumbness\n, tingling, or loss of sensation,\nconfusion\nor disorientation,\nseizures\n.\nTests that may be ordered include:\nAntibody testing to check for paraneoplastic syndromes\nBlood tests (such as a\nCBC\nor\nblood differential\n)\nCT scan of the head\nGenetic testing\nMRI of the head\nYou may need to be referred to a specialist for diagnosis and treatment. If a specific problem is causing the ataxia, the problem will be treated. For example, if a medicine is causing coordination problems, the medicine may be changed or stopped. Other causes may not be treatable. The provider can tell you more.\nAlternative Names\nLack of coordination; Loss of coordination; Coordination impairment; Ataxia; Clumsiness; Uncoordinated movement\nReferences\nJankovic J, Lang AE.

If you smoke, your health care provider may tell you to avoid doing so for a short time before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to monitor the response to treatment and then to check for the return of colon and other cancers such as medullary thyroid cancer and cancers of the rectum, lung, breast, liver, pancreas, stomach, and ovaries.\nIt is not used as a screening test for cancer and should not be done unless a diagnosis of cancer has been made.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 0 to 2.5 ng/mL (0 to 2.5 Âµg/L).\nIn smokers, slightly higher values may be considered normal (0 to 5 ng/mL, or 0 to 5 Âµg/L).\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA high CEA level in a person recently treated for certain cancers may mean the cancer has returned. A higher than normal level may be due to the following cancers:\nBreast cancer\nCancers of the reproductive and urinary tracts\nColon cancer\nLung cancer\nPancreatic cancer\nThyroid cancer\nA higher than normal CEA level alone cannot diagnose a new cancer. Further testing is needed.\nAn increased CEA level may also be due to:\nLiver and gallbladder problems, such as scarring of the liver (\ncirrhosis\n), or gallbladder inflammation (\ncholecystitis\n)\nHeavy smoking\nInflammatory bowel diseases (such as\nulcerative colitis\nor\ndiverticulitis\n)\nLung infection\nInflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\nStomach ulcer\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.

When symptoms do occur, they can involve almost any body part or organ system.\nAlmost all people affected by sarcoidosis have lung or chest symptoms:\nChest pain\n(most often behind the breast bone)\nDry\ncough\nShortness of breath\nCoughing up blood\n(rare, but serious)\nSymptoms of general discomfort may include:\nFatigue\nFever\nJoint ache or pain\n(arthralgia)\nWeight loss\nSkin symptoms may include:\nHair loss\nRaised, red, firm skin sores (\nerythema nodosum\n), almost always on the front part of the lower legs\nRash\nScars that become raised or inflamed\nNervous system symptoms may include:\nHeadache\nSeizures\nWeakness\non one side of the face\nEye symptoms may include:\nBurning, itching, discharge from the eye\nDry eyes\nPain\nVision loss\nOther symptoms of this disease may include:\nDry mouth\nFainting spells\n, if the heart is involved\nNosebleed\nSwelling in the upper part of the abdomen\nLiver disease\nSwelling of the legs if heart and lungs are involved\nAbnormal heart rhythm if the heart is involved\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about the symptoms.\nDifferent imaging tests may help diagnose sarcoidosis:\nChest x-ray\nto see if the lungs are involved or lymph nodes are enlarged\nCT scan\nof the chest\nLung gallium scan\n(rarely done now)\nImaging tests of the\nbrain\nand\nliver\nPET scan of the whole body (or specific body parts)\nEchocardiogram\nor\nMRI\nof the heart\nTo diagnose this condition, a biopsy is needed. A\nbiopsy\nof the lung using\nbronchoscopy\nis usually done. Biopsies of other body tissues may also be done.\nThe following lab tests may be done:\nCalcium levels (\nurine\n,\nionized\n,\nblood\n)\nCBC\nImmunoelectrophoresis\nLiver function tests\nQuantitative immunoglobulins\nPhosphorus\nAngiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)\nTreatment\nSarcoidosis symptoms will often get better without treatment, especially if there are only small lung abnormalities.\nIf the eyes, heart, nervous system, or lungs are affected, corticosteroids are usually prescribed. This medicine may need to be taken for 1 to 2 years.\nMedicines that suppress the immune system are sometimes also needed.\nIn rare cases, people with very severe heart or lung damage (end-stage disease) may need an organ transplant.\nWith sarcoidosis that affects the heart, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (\nICD\n) may be needed to treat heart rhythm problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMany people with sarcoidosis are not seriously ill, and get better without treatment. Up to half of all people with the disease get better in 3 years without treatment. People whose lungs are affected may develop lung damage.\nOverall the death rate from sarcoidosis is less than 5%. Causes of death include:\nBleeding from the lung tissue\nHeart damage, leading to heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms\nLung scarring (pulmonary fibrosis)\nPossible Complications\nSarcoidosis may lead to these health problems:\nFungal lung infections (\naspergillosis\n)\nGlaucoma\nand blindness from\nuveitis\n(rare)\nKidney stones\nfrom high calcium levels in blood or urine\nOsteoporosis\nand other complications of taking corticosteroids for long periods of time\nHigh blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (\npulmonary hypertension\n)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider promptly if you have:\nDifficulty breathing\nIrregular heartbeat\nVision changes\nOther symptoms of this disorder\nPatient Instructions\nInterstitial lung disease - adults - discharge\nImages\nSarcoid, stage I - chest x-ray\nSarcoid, stage II - chest x-ray\nSarcoid, stage IV - chest x-ray\nSarcoid - close-up of the skin lesions\nErythema nodosum associated with sarcoidosis\nSarcoidosis - close-up\nSarcoidosis on the elbow\nSarcoidosis on the nose and forehead\nRespiratory system\nReferences\nIannuzzi MC.

        "hallucinated_answer": "The precise etiology of sarcoidosis remains elusive; however, it is established that when afflicted with the illness, compact amalgamations of anomalous tissue (granulomas) develop within specific organs. Granulomas are assemblages of immunological elements. Sarcoidosis can potentially influence virtually any organ; nevertheless, it most frequently targets the lungs. Medical professionals conjecture that particular genotypes heighten an individual's predisposition to sarcoidosis. Probable triggers for this condition encompass microbial infections (bacteria or viruses), exposure to particulate matter, and chemical agents. This ailment is more prevalent among African Americans and individuals of Scandinavian ancestry. A higher incidence of sarcoidosis affects women compared to men. The onset of the disease typically occurs between 40-20 years of age. Sarcoidosis in very young children is uncommon. An individual with a close blood relative suffering from sarcoidosis has nearly five times greater likelihood of developing the condition."

        "question": "Do you have information about Enteroscopy",
        "right_answer": "Enteroscopy is a procedure used to examine the small intestine (small bowel).",
        "context": "Enteroscopy is a procedure used to examine the small intestine (small bowel).\nHow the Test is Performed\nA thin, flexible tube (\nendoscope\n) is inserted through the mouth and into the upper gastrointestinal tract. During a double-balloon enteroscopy, balloons attached to the endoscope can be inflated to allow the doctor to view a section of the small intestine.\nIn a\ncolonoscopy\n, a flexible tube is inserted through your rectum and colon. The tube can most often reach into the end part of the small intestine (ileum).\nCapsule endoscopy\nis done with a disposable capsule that you swallow.\nTissue samples removed during enteroscopy are sent to the lab for examination. (Biopsies cannot be taken with a capsule endoscopy.)\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDo not take products containing aspirin for 1 week before the procedure. Tell your health care provider if you take blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), or apixaban (Eliquis) because these may interfere with the test. Do not stop taking any medicine unless told to do so by your provider.\nDo not eat any solid foods or milk products after midnight the day of your procedure. You may have clear liquids until 4 hours before your exam.\nYou must sign a consent form.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will be given calming and sedating medicine for the procedure and will not feel any discomfort. You may have some bloating or cramping when you wake up. This is from air that is pumped into the abdomen to expand the area during the procedure.\nA capsule endoscopy causes no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often performed to help diagnose diseases of the small intestines. It may be done if you have:\nAbnormal x-ray results\nTumors in the small intestines\nUnexplained diarrhea\nUnexplained gastrointestinal bleeding\nNormal Results\nIn a normal test result, the provider will not find sources of bleeding in the small bowel, and will not find any tumors or other abnormal tissue.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nSigns may include:\nAbnormalities of the tissue lining the small intestine (mucosa) or the tiny, finger-like projections on the surface of the small intestine (villi)\nAbnormal lengthening of blood vessels (angioectasis) in the intestinal lining\nImmune cells called PAS-positive macrophages\nPolyps\nor cancer\nRadiation enteritis\nSwollen or enlarged\nlymph nodes\nor lymphatic vessels\nUlcers\nChanges found on enteroscopy may be signs of disorders and conditions, including:\nAmyloidosis\nCeliac sprue\nCrohn disease\nFolate\nor\nvitamin B12\ndeficiency\nGiardiasis\nInfectious\ngastroenteritis\nLymphangiectasia\nLymphoma\nSmall intestinal angiectasia\nSmall intestinal cancer\nTropical sprue\nWhipple disease\nRisks\nComplications are rare but may include:\nExcessive bleeding from the biopsy site\nHole in the bowel (bowel perforation)\nInfection of the biopsy site leading to\nbacteremia\nVomiting, followed by\naspiration\ninto the lungs\nThe capsule endoscope can cause a blockage in a narrowed intestine with symptoms of abdominal pain and bloating\nConsiderations\nFactors that prohibit use of this test may include:\nUncooperative or confused person\nUntreated blood clotting (coagulation) disorders\nUse of aspirin or other medicines that prevent the blood from clotting normally (anticoagulants)\nThe greatest risk is bleeding.

        "right_answer": "You can ease the  stress  of the illness by joining a  muscular dystrophy support group  where members share common experiences and problems.",
        "context": "Becker muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder that involves slowly worsening\nmuscle weakness\nof the legs and pelvis.\nCauses\nBecker muscular dystrophy is very similar to\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy\n. The main difference is that it gets worse at a much slower rate and it is less common. This disease is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes a protein called dystrophin.\nThe disorder is passed down through families (inherited). Having a family history of the condition raises your risk.\nBecker muscular dystrophy occurs in about 3 to 6 out of every 100,000 births. The disease is found mostly in boys.\nSymptoms\nFemales rarely develop symptoms. Males will develop symptoms if they inherit the defective gene. Symptoms most often appear in boys between ages 5 and 15, but may begin later.\nMuscle weakness of the lower body, including the legs and pelvis area, slowly gets worse, causing:\nDifficulty walking that gets worse over time; by age 25 to 30, the person is usually unable to walk\nFrequent falls\nDifficulty getting up from the floor and climbing stairs\nDifficulty with running, hopping, and jumping\nLoss of muscle mass\nToe walking\nMuscle weakness in the arms, neck, and other areas is not as severe as in the lower body\nOther symptoms may include:\nBreathing problems\nCognitive problems (these do not get worse over time)\nFatigue\nLoss of balance and coordination\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will do a nervous system (neurological) and muscle exam. A careful medical history is also important, because symptoms are similar to those of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, Becker muscular dystrophy gets worse much more slowly.\nAn exam may find:\nAbnormally developed bones, leading to deformities of the chest and back (\nscoliosis\n)\nAbnormal heart muscle function (\ncardiomyopathy\n)\nCongestive heart failure\nor irregular heartbeat (\narrhythmia\n) - rare\nMuscle deformities, including\ncontractures\nof heels and legs, abnormal fat and connective tissue in calf muscles\nMuscle loss that begins in the legs and pelvis, then moves to the muscles of the shoulders, neck, arms, and respiratory system\nTests that may be done include:\nCPK\nblood test\nElectromyography (\nEMG\n) nerve testing\nMuscle biopsy\nor genetic test\nTreatment\nThere is no known cure for Becker muscular dystrophy. However there are many new drugs currently undergoing clinical testing that show significant promise in treating the disease. The current goal of treatment is to control symptoms to maximize the person's quality of life. Some providers prescribe steroids to help keep a patient walking for as long as possible.\nActivity is encouraged. Inactivity (such as bed rest) can make the muscle disease worse. Physical therapy may be helpful to maintain muscle strength. Orthopedic appliances such as braces and wheelchairs may improve movement and self-care.\nAbnormal heart function may require the use of a pacemaker.\nGenetic counseling may be recommended. Daughters of a man with Becker muscular dystrophy will very likely carry the defective gene and could pass it on to their sons.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the\nstress\nof the illness by joining a\nmuscular dystrophy support group\nwhere members share common experiences and problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBecker muscular dystrophy leads to slowly worsening disability. However, the amount of disability varies. Some people may need a wheelchair. Others may only need to use walking aids such as canes or braces.\nLifespan is most often shortened if there are heart and breathing problems.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nHeart-related problems such as cardiomyopathy\nLung failure\nPneumonia\nor other\nrespiratory\ninfections\nIncreasing and permanent disability that leads to decreased ability to care for self, decreased mobility\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall your provider if:\nSymptoms of Becker muscular dystrophy appear\nA person with Becker muscular dystrophy develops new symptoms (particularly\nfever\nwith\ncough\nor\nbreathing difficulties\n)\nYou are planning to start a family and you or other family members have been diagnosed with Becker muscular dystrophy\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling may be advised if there is a family history of Becker muscular dystrophy.\nAlternative Names\nBenign pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy; Becker's dystrophy\nImages\nSuperficial anterior muscles\nDeep anterior muscles\nTendons and muscles\nLower leg muscles\nReferences\nBharucha-Goebel DX.

        "context": "Why is this medication prescribed?\nPosaconazole is used to prevent serious fungal infections that can spread throughout the body in adults and children 2 years of age and older with a weakened ability to fight infection. Posaconazole delayed-release tablets are used to treat invasive aspergillosis (a serious fungal infection that begins in the lungs and spreads through the bloodstream to other organs) in adults and teenagers 13 years of age and older. Posaconazole oral suspension is also used to treat yeast infections of the mouth and throat including yeast infections in adults and teenagers 13 years of age and older that could not be treated successfully with other medications. Posaconazole is in a class of medications called azole antifungals. It works by slowing the growth of fungi that cause infection.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nPosaconazole comes as an immediate-release oral suspension (liquid), as a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent break-down of the medication by stomach acids) tablet, and as a delayed-release oral suspension to take by mouth. The delayed-release tablets are usually taken with or without food twice daily on the first day and then once a day. The delayed-release oral suspension is usually taken with food twice daily on the first day and then once a day. The immediate-release oral suspension is usually taken one to three times a day with a full meal or within 20 minutes after a meal. If you cannot take the immediate-release oral suspension with a full meal, take it with a liquid nutritional supplement or an acidic carbonated drink such as ginger ale. Your doctor will determine how long you need to use this medication. Take posaconazole at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take posaconazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nShake the oral suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly.\nAlways use the dosing spoon that comes with posaconazole immediate-release oral suspension to measure your dose. You may not receive the correct amount of medication if you use a household spoon to measure your dose. The spoon should be rinsed thoroughly with water after each use and before storing.\nSwallow the posaconazole delayed-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If you cannot swallow the delayed-release tablets whole, tell your doctor.\nIf you or your child are using the delayed-release oral suspension, only use the mixing liquid that comes with the kit to prepare it. Add 9 mL of the mixing liquid to the delayed-release oral suspension powder. Shake the powder and liquid in the mixing cup vigorously for 45 seconds to mix. The mixture should look cloudy and not have any clumps. Once mixed, measure the dose with the syringe provided with the kit. Take the mixture with food within 1 hour of mixing. If you or your child are unable to take all of the dose or if some of the dose is spit out, call your doctor.\nEach posaconazole product releases the medication differently in your body and cannot be used interchangeably. Only take the posaconazole product prescribed by your doctor and do not switch to a different posaconazole product unless your doctor says that you should.\nAsk your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\nOther uses for this medicine\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nWhat special precautions should I follow?\nBefore taking posaconazole,\ntell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to posaconazole; other antifungal medications such as fluconazole (Diflucan), isavuconazonium (Cresemba), itraconazole (Onmel, Sporanox, Tolsura), ketoconazole, or voriconazole (Vfend); simethicone; any other medications; or any of the ingredients in posaconazole products. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\nSome medications should not be taken with posaconazole. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting posaconazole with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping or changing any medications while taking posaconazole, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.\ntell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking posaconazole. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\ntell your doctor if you have a fructose intolerance (an inherited condition in which the body lacks the protein needed to break down fructose [a fruit sugar found in certain sweeteners such as sorbitol]), Your doctor will probably tell you not to take posaconazole delayed-release oral suspension if you have a fructose intolerance.\ntell your doctor if you have or have ever had a slow or irregular heartbeat; a prolonged QT interval (a rare heart problem that may cause irregular heartbeat, fainting, or sudden death); problems with blood circulation; low levels of calcium, magnesium, or potassium in your blood; or kidney, or liver disease.\ntell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking posaconazole, call your doctor.\nask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking posaconazole delayed-release oral suspension. Alcohol can make the side effects from posaconazole worse.\nWhat special dietary instructions should I follow?\nUnless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.\nWhat should I do if I forget a dose?\nIf you are taking the immediate-release or delayed-release oral suspension, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\nIf you are taking the delayed-release tablets, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is within 12 hours of your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule.

        "question": "Who should not get Anthrax Vaccine and what are its contraindications ?",
        "right_answer": "Anyone who has had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of anthrax vaccine should not get another dose., Anyone who has a severe allergy to any vaccine component should not get a dose. Tell your provider if you have any severe allergies, including latex., If you have ever had Guillain Barr syndrome (GBS), your provider might recommend not getting anthrax vaccine., If you have a moderate or severe illness your provider might ask you to wait until you recover to get the vaccine. People with mild illness can usually be vaccinated., Vaccination may be recommended for pregnant women who have been exposed to anthrax and are at risk of developing inhalation disease. Nursing mothers may safely be given anthrax vaccine., ",
        "context": "What is anthrax?\nAnthrax is a serious disease that can affect both animals and humans. It is caused by bacteria called\nBacillus anthracis\n. People can get anthrax from contact with infected animals, wool, meat, or hides.\nCutaneous Anthrax.\nIn its most common form, anthrax is a skin disease that causes skin ulcers and usually fever and fatigue. Up to 20% of these cases are fatal if untreated.\nGastrointestinal Anthrax.\nThis form of anthrax can result from eating raw or undercooked infected meat. Symptoms can include fever, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, abdominal pain and swelling, and swollen lymph glands. Gastrointestinal anthrax can lead to blood poisoning, shock, and death.\nInhalation Anthrax.\nThis form of anthrax occurs when\nB. anthracis\nis inhaled, and is very serious. The first symptoms can include a sore throat, mild fever and muscle aches. Within several days these symptoms are followed by severe breathing problems, shock, and often meningitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord covering). This form of anthrax requires hospitalization and aggressive treatment with antibiotics. It is often fatal.\nWhat is anthrax vaccine?\nAnthrax vaccine protects against anthrax disease. The vaccine used in the United States does not contain\nB. anthracis\ncells and it does not cause anthrax. Anthrax vaccine was licensed in 1970 and relicensed in 2008.\nBased on limited but sound evidence, the vaccine protects against both cutaneous (skin) and inhalational anthrax.\nWho should get anthrax vaccine and when?\nAnthrax vaccine is recommended for certain people 18 through 65 years of age who might be exposed to large amounts of\nB. anthracis\nbacteria on the job, including:\ncertain laboratory or remediation workers\nsome people handling animals or animal products\nsome military personnel, as determined by the Department of Defense\nThese people should get five doses of vaccine (in the muscle): the first dose when risk of a potential exposure is identified, and the remaining doses at 4 weeks and 6, 12, and 18 months after the first dose.\nAnnual booster doses are needed for ongoing protection.\nIf a dose is not given at the scheduled time, the series does not have to be started over. Resume the series as soon as practical.\nAnthrax vaccine is also recommended for unvaccinated people who have been exposed to anthrax in certain situations. These people should get three doses of vaccine (under the skin), with the first dose as soon after exposure as possible, and the second and third doses given 2 and 4 weeks after the first.\nWho should not get anthrax vaccine or should wait?\nAnyone who has had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of anthrax vaccine should not get another dose.\nAnyone who has a severe allergy to any vaccine component should not get a dose. Tell your provider if you have any severe allergies, including latex.\nIf you have ever had Guillain Barr syndrome (GBS), your provider might recommend not getting anthrax vaccine.\nIf you have a moderate or severe illness your provider might ask you to wait until you recover to get the vaccine. People with mild illness can usually be vaccinated.\nVaccination may be recommended for pregnant women who have been exposed to anthrax and are at risk of developing inhalation disease. Nursing mothers may safely be given anthrax vaccine.\nWhat are the risks from anthrax vaccine?\nLike any medicine, a vaccine could cause a serious problem, such as a severe allergic reaction.\nAnthrax is a very serious disease, and the risk of serious harm from the vaccine is extremely small.\nTenderness on the arm where the shot was given (about 1 person out of 2)\nRedness on the arm where the shot was given (about 1 out of 7 men and 1 out of 3 women)\nItching on the arm where the shot was given (about 1 out of 50 men and 1 out of 20 women)\nLump on the arm where the shot was given (about 1 out of 60 men and 1 out of 16 women)\nBruise on the arm where the shot was given (about 1 out of 25 men and 1 out of 22 women)\nMuscle aches or temporary limitation of arm movement (about 1 out of 14 men and 1 out of 10 women)\nHeadaches (about 1 out of 25 men and 1 out of 12 women)\nFatigue (about 1 out of 15 men, about 1 out of 8 women)\nSerious allergic reaction (very rare - less than once in 100,000 doses).\nAs with any vaccine, other severe problems have been reported. But these don't appear to occur any more often among anthrax vaccine recipients than among unvaccinated people.\nThere is no evidence that anthrax vaccine causes long-term health problems.\nIndependent civilian committees have not found anthrax vaccination to be a factor in unexplained illnesses among Gulf War veterans.\nWhat if there is a moderate or severe reaction?\nAny unusual condition, such as a severe allergic reaction or a high fever. If a severe allergic reaction occurred, it would be within a few minutes to an hour after the shot. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, weakness, hoarseness or wheezing, a fast heart beat, hives, dizziness, paleness, or swelling of the throat.\nCall a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away.\nTell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given.\nAsk your provider to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS website at\nhttps://vaers.hhs.gov/index\nor by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not provide medical advice.\nInjury compensation\nA Federal program, the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, has been created under the PREP Act to help pay for medical care and other specific expenses of certain individuals who have a serious reaction to this vaccine.\nIf you have a reaction to the vaccine your ability to sue may be limited by law. For more information, visit the program's website at www.hrsa.gov/countermeasurescomp, or call 1-888-275-4772.\nHow can I learn more?\nAsk your doctor or other health care provider. They can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information.\nContact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO) or visit the CDC's website at\nhttp://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/vaccination/\n.\nContact the U.S Department of Defense (DoD): call 1-877-438-8222 or visit the DoD website at\nhttp://www.anthrax.osd.mil\n.\nAnthrax Vaccine Information Statement.

        "context": "Why is this medication prescribed?\nTasimelteon is used to treat non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder (non-24; a condition that occurs mainly in people who are blind in which the body's natural clock is out of sync with the normal day-night cycle and causes a disrupted sleep schedule) in adults. It is also used to treat nighttime sleep problems in adults and children 3 years of age and older with Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS; a developmental disorder). Tasimelteon is in a class of medications called melatonin receptor agonists. It works similarly to melatonin, a natural substance in the brain that is needed for sleep.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nTasimelteon comes as a capsule and as an suspension to take by mouth. It is usually taken without food once a day, 1 hour before bedtime. Take tasimelteon at the same time every night. If you or your child are unable to take tasimelteon around the same time on a given night, skip that dose and take the next dose as scheduled. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tasimelteon exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nSwallow the capsules whole; do not open, crush, or chew them.\nIf you or your child are taking the suspension, follow these steps to prepare and measure the dose:\nRemove the tasimelteon bottle, bottle adapter, and oral dosing syringe from the carton.\nShake the bottle up and down for at least 30 seconds to mix the medication evenly before each administration.\nPress down on the child-resistant cap and twist it counterclockwise to open the bottle; do not discard the cap.\nBefore you open the tasimelteon bottle for the first time, remove the seal from bottle and insert the press-in bottle adapter into the bottle.

Then, replace the cap by turning clockwise and shake well again for 30 seconds.\nPush the plunger of the oral dosing syringe completely down. Insert the oral dosing syringe into the opening of the press-in bottle adapter as far as it will go.\nWith the oral dosing syringe in the bottle adapter, carefully turn the bottle upside down. Pull the plunger back to withdraw the amount of suspension prescribed by the doctor. If you are not sure how to correctly measure the dose, ask your doctor or pharmacist. If you see more than a few air bubbles in the oral dosing syringe, fully push in the plunger so that the liquid flows back into the bottle until the air bubbles are mostly gone.\nLeave the oral dosing syringe in the bottle adapter and turn the bottle upright. Carefully remove the oral dosing syringe from the bottle adapter. Replace the child-resistant cap securely.\nRemove the dosing dispenser and slowly squirt the suspension directly into your mouth or your child's mouth and toward the inside of their cheek. Slowly push the plunger all the way in to give the entire dose. Make sure the child has time to swallow the medication.\nRemove the plunger from the barrel of the oral dosing syringe. Rinse the oral dosing syringe barrel and plunger with water and when dry, put the plunger back into the oral dosing syringe. Do not wash the oral dosing syringe in the dishwasher.\nDo not discard the oral dosing syringe. Always use the oral dosing syringe that comes with tasimelteon to measure your child's dose.\nRefrigerate the suspension after each use.\nYou may become sleepy soon after you take tasimelteon. After you take tasimelteon, you should complete any necessary bedtime preparations and go to bed. Do not plan any other activities for this time.\nTasimelteon controls certain sleep disorders, but does not cure them. It may take several weeks or months before you feel the full benefit of tasimelteon. Continue to take tasimelteon even if you feel well. Do not stop taking tasimelteon without talking to your doctor.\nTasimelteon is not available in pharmacies. You can only get tasimelteon through the mail from a specialty pharmacy. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about receiving your medication.\nTasimelteon capsules and suspension may not be able to be substituted for one another. Ask your pharmacist if you have any questions about the type of tasimelteon product your doctor has prescribed.\nOther uses for this medicine\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nWhat special precautions should I follow?\nBefore taking tasimelteon,\ntell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to tasimelteon, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in tasimelteon capsules and suspension. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.\ntell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.

        "context": "Why is this medication prescribed?\nRilpivirine is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in certain adults and children 12 years of age and older who weigh at least 77 lb (35 kg) and have not received antiretroviral treatment in the past. It is also used along with cabotegravir (Vocabria) as a short-term treatment of HIV-1 infection in certain adults. Rilpivirine is in a class of medications called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although rilpivirine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nRilpivirine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with a meal (not just a protein drink) once a day.  When rilpivirine is taken along with cabotegravir, it is usually taken once daily with a meal. Take rilpivirine alone or along with cabotegravir at around the same time every day. Rilpivirine is taken along with cabotegravir for about one month (for at least 28 days) prior to starting treatment with the long-acting injectable forms of these medications or for up to 2 months if the injectable treatment schedule is missed for more than 7 days. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rilpivirine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nRilpivirine controls HIV but does not cure it. Continue to take rilpivirine even if you feel well.

        "context": "IMPORTANT WARNING:\nTaking metoclopramide may cause you to develop a muscle problem called tardive dyskinesia. If you develop tardive dyskinesia, you will move your muscles, especially the muscles in your face in unusual ways. You will not be able to control or stop these movements. Tardive dyskinesia may not go away even after you stop taking metoclopramide. The longer you take metoclopramide, the greater the risk that you will develop tardive dyskinesia. Therefore, your doctor will probably tell you not to take metoclopramide for longer than 12 weeks. The risk that you will develop tardive dyskinesia is also greater if you are taking medications for mental illness, if you have diabetes, or if you are elderly, especially if you are a woman. Call your doctor immediately if you develop any uncontrollable body movements, especially lip smacking, mouth puckering, chewing, frowning, scowling, sticking out your tongue, blinking, eye movements, or shaking arms or legs.\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with metoclopramide and each time you refill your prescription.

Metoclopramide is also used to relieve symptoms caused by slow stomach emptying in people who have diabetes. These symptoms include nausea, vomiting, heartburn, loss of appetite, and feeling of fullness that lasts long after meals. Metoclopramide is in a class of medications called prokinetic agents. It works by speeding the movement of food through the stomach and intestines.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nMetoclopramide comes as a tablet, an orally disintegrating (dissolving) tablet, and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken 4 times a day on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime. When metoclopramide is used to treat symptoms of GERD, it may be taken less frequently, especially if symptoms only occur at certain times of day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take metoclopramide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nIf you are taking the orally disintegrating tablet, use dry hands to remove the tablet from the package just before you take your dose. If the tablet breaks or crumbles, dispose of it and remove a new tablet from the package. Gently remove the tablet and immediately place it on the top of your tongue. The tablet will usually dissolve in about one minute and can be swallowed with saliva.\nIf you are taking metoclopramide to treat the symptoms of slow stomach emptying caused by diabetes, you should know that your symptoms will not improve all at once. You may notice that your nausea improves early in your treatment and continues to improve over the next 3 weeks. Your vomiting and loss of appetite may also improve early in your treatment, but it may take longer for your feeling of fullness to go away.\nContinue to take metoclopramide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking metoclopramide without talking to your doctor. You may experience withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness, nervousness, and headaches when you stop taking metoclopramide.\nOther uses for this medicine\nMetoclopramide is also sometimes used to treat the symptoms of slowed stomach emptying in people who are recovering from certain types of surgery, and to prevent nausea and vomiting in people who are being treated with chemotherapy for cancer. Ask your doctor about the risks of using this medication to treat your condition.\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nWhat special precautions should I follow?\nBefore taking metoclopramide,\ntell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to metoclopramide, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in metoclopramide tablets or solution.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them. The best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community. See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location – one that is down and near and within their sight and reach. http://www.upandaway.org"

        "context": "IMPORTANT WARNING:\nOnabotulinumtoxinA injection is given as a number of tiny injections intended to affect only the specific area where injected. However, it is possible that the medication may spread from the area of injection and affect muscles in other areas of the body.  If the muscles that control breathing and swallowing are affected, you may develop severe problems breathing or swallowing that may last for several months and may cause death. If you have difficulty swallowing, you may need to be fed through a feeding tube to avoid getting food or drink into your lungs.\nOnabotulinumtoxinA injection may spread and cause symptoms in people of any age who are being treated for any condition, although no one has yet developed these symptoms after receiving the medication at recommended doses to treat wrinkles, eye problems, headaches, or severe underarm sweating. The risk that the medication will spread beyond the area of injection is probably highest in children being treated for spasticity (muscle stiffness and tightness) and in people, who have or have ever had swallowing problems, or breathing problems, such as asthma or emphysema; or any condition that affects muscles or nerves such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease; condition in which the nerves that control muscle movement slowly die, causing the muscles to shrink and weaken), motor neuropathy (condition in which the muscles weaken over time), myasthenia gravis (condition that causes certain muscles to weaken, especially after activity), or Lambert-Eaton syndrome (condition that causes muscle weakness that may improve with activity). Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had any of these conditions.\nSpread of onabotulinumtoxinA injection into untreated areas can cause other symptoms in addition to difficulty breathing or swallowing. Symptoms may occur within hours of an injection or as late as several weeks after treatment. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: loss of strength or muscle weakness all over the body; double or blurred vision; drooping eyelids or brow; difficulty swallowing or breathing; hoarseness or change or loss of voice; difficulty speaking or saying words clearly; or inability to control urination.\nYour doctor will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA injection and each time you receive treatment. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm\n) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nOnabotulinumtoxinA injection (Botox, Botox Cosmetic) is used to treat a number of conditions.\nOnabotulinumtoxinA injection (Botox) is used to:\nrelieve the symptoms of cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis; uncontrollable tightening of the neck muscles that may cause neck pain and abnormal head positions) in people 16 years of age and older;\nrelieve the symptoms of strabismus (an eye muscle problem that causes the eye to turn inward or outward) and blepharospasm (uncontrollable tightening of the eyelid muscles that may cause blinking, squinting, and abnormal eyelid movements) in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older;\nprevent headaches in people older than 18 years of age with chronic migraine (severe, throbbing headaches that are sometimes accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound or light) who have 15 or more days each month with headaches lasting 4 hours a day or longer;\ntreat overactive bladder (a condition in which the bladder muscles contract uncontrollably and cause frequent urination, urgent need to urinate, and inability to control urination) in people 18 years of age and older when other medications do not work well enough or cannot be taken;\ntreat neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO; a bladder control condition caused by brain, spinal cord or nerve problem) in children 5 years of age and older when other medications did not help or could not be tolerated;\ntreat incontinence (leakage of urine) in people 18 years of age and older with overactive bladder (condition in which the bladder muscles have uncontrollable spasms) caused by nerve problems such as spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and people may experience weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination, and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control), who cannot be treated with oral medication;\ntreat spasticity (muscle stiffness and tightness) of muscles in the arms and legs in adults and children 2 years of age and older;\ntreat severe underarm sweating in people 18 years of age and older who cannot be treated with products applied on the skin;\nand\nOnabotulinumtoxinA injection (Botox Cosmetic) is used to\ntemporarily smooth frown lines (wrinkles between the eyebrows) in adults 18 years of age and older,\ntemporarily smooth crow's feet lines (wrinkles near the outer corner of the eye) in adults 18 years of age and older,\nand to temporarily smooth forehead lines in adults 18 years of age and older.\nOnabotulinumtoxinA injection is in a class of medications called neurotoxins. When onabotulinumtoxinA is injected into a muscle, it blocks the nerve signals that cause uncontrollable tightening and movements of the muscle. When onabotulinumtoxinA is injected into a sweat gland, it decreases the activity of the gland to reduce sweating. When onabotulinumtoxinA is injected into the bladder, it decreases bladder contractions and blocks signals that tell the nervous system that the bladder is full.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nOnabotulinumtoxinA injection comes as a powder to be mixed with a liquid and injected into a muscle, into the skin, or into the wall of the bladder by a doctor. Your doctor will choose the best place to inject the medication in order to treat your condition. If you are receiving onabotulinumtoxinA to treat frown lines, forehead lines, crow's feet lines, cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, strabismus, spasticity, urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, or chronic migraine, you may receive additional injections every 3 to 4 months, depending on your condition and on how long the effects of the treatment last. If you are receiving onabotulinumtoxinA injection to treat severe underarm sweating or neurogenic detrusor overactivity, you may need to receive additional injections once every 6 to 7 months or as recommended by your doctor when your symptoms return.\nIf you are receiving onabotulinumtoxinA injection to treat severe underarm sweating, your doctor will probably perform a test to find the areas that need to be treated. Your doctor will tell you how to prepare for this test. You will probably be told to shave your underarms and not to use nonprescription deodorants or antiperspirants for 24 hours before the test.\nIf you are receiving onabotulinumtoxinA injection to treat urinary incontinence, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics for you to take for 1-3 days before your treatment, on the day of your treatment and for 1 to 3 days after your treatment.\nYour doctor may change your dose of onabotulinumtoxinA injection to find the dose that will work best for you.\nYour doctor may use an anesthetic cream, or a cold pack, to numb your skin, or eye drops to numb your eyes before injecting onabotulinumtoxinA.\nOne brand or type of botulinum toxin cannot be substituted for another.\nOnabotulinumtoxinA injection may help control your condition but will not cure it. It may take a few days or up to several weeks before you feel the full benefit of onabotulinumtoxinA injection. Ask your doctor when you can expect to see improvement, and call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during the expected time.\nOther uses for this medicine\nOnabotulinumtoxinA injection is also sometimes used to treat other conditions in which abnormal muscle tightening causes pain, abnormal movements, or other symptoms. OnabotulinumtoxinA injection is also sometimes used to treat excessive sweating of the hands, many types of wrinkles of the face, tremor (uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body), and anal fissures (a split or tear in the tissue near the rectal area). The medication is also sometimes used to improve the ability to move in children with cerebral palsy (condition that causes difficulty with movement and balance). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nWhat special precautions should I follow?\nBefore receiving onabotulinumtoxinA injection,\ntell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to onabotulinumtoxinA, abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport), incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin), prabotulinumtoxinA-xvfs (Jeuveau), or rimabotulinumtoxinB (Myobloc).

Taking thiamine by mouth helps prevent and treat thiamine deficiency., \n\n\n A brain disorder caused by low levels of thiamine (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome) . Thiamine helps decrease the risk and symptoms of a specific brain disorder called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS). This brain disorder is related to low levels of thiamine. It is often seen in alcoholics. Giving thiamine shots seems to help decrease the risk of developing WKS and decrease symptoms of WKS during alcohol withdrawal., \n\n\n Possibly effective for... Cataracts . High thiamine intake as part of the diet is associated with reduced odds of developing cataracts., \n\n Kidney damage in people with diabetes (diabetic nephropathy) . Early research shows that taking high-dose thiamine (300 mg daily) decreases the amount of albumin in the urine in people with type 2 diabetes. Albumin in the urine is an indication of kidney damage., \n\n\n Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea) . Taking thiamine seems to reduce menstrual pain in teenage girls and young women. , \n\n Possibly ineffective for... \n\n Surgery to improve blood flow to the heart (CABG surgery) . Some research shows that giving thiamine into the vein before and after CABG surgery does not lead to better outcomes than placebo., \n\n Mosquito repellent . Some research shows that taking B vitamins, including thiamine, does not help to repel mosquitos., \n\n Blood infection (sepsis) . Most research shows that giving thiamine by IV, alone or with vitamin C, does not reduce the risk of dying in people with sepsis., \n\n   Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for... \n\n Cancer of the cervix . Increased intake of thiamine and other B vitamins is linked with a decreased risk of precancerous spots on the cervix., \n\n Depression . Early research shows that taking thiamine daily along with the antidepressant fluoxetine may reduce symptoms of depression faster than taking fluoxetine alone. People taking thiamine showed more improvements after 6 weeks. But after 12 weeks, symptoms were the same for those taking thiamine or placebo. , \n\n Dementia . Taking thiamine is linked to a reduced risk of dementia in people with alcohol use disorder., \n\n Heart failure . People with heart failure are more likely to develop thiamine deficiency.

        "context": "What is it?\nThiamine is a vitamin, also called vitamin B1. Vitamin B1 is found in many foods including yeast, cereal grains, beans, nuts, and meat. It is often used in combination with other B vitamins, and found in many vitamin B complex products. Vitamin B complexes generally include vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin/niacinamide), vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), and folic acid. However, some products do not contain all of these ingredients and some may include others, such as biotin, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), choline bitartrate, and inositol.\nPeople take thiamine for conditions related to low levels of thiamine (thiamine deficiency syndromes), including beriberi and inflammation of the nerves (neuritis) associated with pellagra or pregnancy.\nThiamine is also used for boosting the immune system, digestive problems, diabetic pain, heart disease, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\nHealthcare providers give thiamine shots for a memory disorder called Wernicke's encephalopathy syndrome, other thiamine deficiency syndromes in critically ill people, and alcohol withdrawal.\nHow effective is it?\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database\nrates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\nThe effectiveness ratings for\nTHIAMINE\nare as follows:\nEffective for...\nThiamine deficiency\n. Taking thiamine by mouth helps prevent and treat thiamine deficiency.\nA brain disorder caused by low levels of thiamine (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome)\n. Thiamine helps decrease the risk and symptoms of a specific brain disorder called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS). This brain disorder is related to low levels of thiamine. It is often seen in alcoholics. Giving thiamine shots seems to help decrease the risk of developing WKS and decrease symptoms of WKS during alcohol withdrawal.\nPossibly effective for...\nCataracts\n. High thiamine intake as part of the diet is associated with reduced odds of developing cataracts.\nKidney damage in people with diabetes (diabetic nephropathy)\n. Early research shows that taking high-dose thiamine (300 mg daily) decreases the amount of albumin in the urine in people with type 2 diabetes. Albumin in the urine is an indication of kidney damage.\nMenstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea)\n. Taking thiamine seems to reduce menstrual pain in teenage girls and young women.\nPossibly ineffective for...\nSurgery to improve blood flow to the heart (CABG surgery)\n. Some research shows that giving thiamine into the vein before and after CABG surgery does not lead to better outcomes than placebo.\nMosquito repellent\n. Some research shows that taking B vitamins, including thiamine, does not help to repel mosquitos.\nBlood infection (sepsis)\n. Most research shows that giving thiamine by IV, alone or with vitamin C, does not reduce the risk of dying in people with sepsis.\nInsufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...\nCancer of the cervix\n. Increased intake of thiamine and other B vitamins is linked with a decreased risk of precancerous spots on the cervix.\nDepression\n. Early research shows that taking thiamine daily along with the antidepressant fluoxetine may reduce symptoms of depression faster than taking fluoxetine alone. People taking thiamine showed more improvements after 6 weeks. But after 12 weeks, symptoms were the same for those taking thiamine or placebo.\nDementia\n. Taking thiamine is linked to a reduced risk of dementia in people with alcohol use disorder.\nHeart failure\n. People with heart failure are more likely to develop thiamine deficiency. Some research shows that taking extra thiamine might slightly improve the function of the heart. But thiamine doesn't seem to help people who suddenly develop heart failure and don't have thiamine deficiency.\nShingles (herpes zoster)\n.Injecting thiamine under the skin seems to reduce itch, but not pain, in people with shingles.\nPrediabetes\n. Early research shows that taking thiamine by mouth helps decrease post-meal blood sugar levels in people with prediabetes.\nAging\n.\nAIDS\n.\nAlcoholism\n.\nBrain conditions\n.\nCanker sores\n.\nChronic diarrhea\n.\nA mental state in which a person is confused and unable to think clearly\n.\nHeart disease\n.\nPoor appetite\n.\nStomach problems\n.\nStress\n.\nUlcerative colitis\n.\nOther conditions\n.\nMore evidence is needed to rate thiamine for these uses.\nHow does it work?\nThiamine is required by our bodies to properly use carbohydrates. It also helps maintain proper nerve function.\nAre there safety concerns?\nWhen taken by mouth\n: Thiamine is\nLIKELY SAFE\nwhen taken by mouth in appropriate amounts, although rare allergic reactions and skin irritation have occurred.\nWhen given by IV\n: Thiamine is\nLIKELY SAFE\nwhen given appropriately by a healthcare provider. Thiamine injection is an FDA-approved prescription product.\nWhen given as a shot\n: Thiamine is\nLIKELY SAFE\nwhen given appropriately as a shot into the muscle by a healthcare provider. Thiamine shots are an FDA-approved prescription product.\nThiamine might not properly enter the body in some people who have liver problems, drink a lot of alcohol, or have other conditions.\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n: Thiamine is\nLIKELY SAFE\nfor pregnant or breast-feeding women when taken in the recommended amount of 1.4 mg daily. Not enough is known about the safety of using larger amounts during pregnancy or breast-feeding.\nAlcoholism and a liver disease called cirrhosis\n: Alcoholics and people with cirrhosis often have low levels of thiamine. Nerve pain in alcoholism can be worsened by thiamine deficiency. These people might require thiamine supplements.\nCritical illness\n: People that are critically ill such as those that had surgery might have low levels of thiamine.  These people might require thiamine supplements.\nHeart failure\n: People with heart failure might have low levels of thiamine. These people might require thiamine supplements.\nHemodialysis\n: People undergoing hemodialysis treatments might have low levels of thiamine. They might require thiamine supplements.\nSyndromes in which it is difficult for the body to absorb nutrients (malabsorption syndromes)\n: People with malabsorption syndromes may have low levels of thiamine. The might require thiamine supplements.\nAre there interactions with medications?\nIt is not known if this product interacts with any medicines.\nBefore taking this product, talk with your health professional if you take any medications.\nAre there interactions with herbs and supplements?\nBetel Nut\nBetel (areca) nuts change thiamine chemically so it doesn't work as well. Regular, long-term chewing of betel nuts may contribute to thiamine deficiency.\nHorsetail\nHorsetail (Equisetum) contains a chemical that can destroy thiamine in the stomach, possibly leading to thiamine deficiency. The Canadian government requires that equisetum-containing products be certified free of this chemical. Stay on the safe side, and don't use horsetail if you are at risk for thiamine deficiency.\nAre there interactions with foods?\nCaffeine-containing foods\nChemicals in coffee and tea called tannins can react with thiamine, converting it to a form that is difficult for the body to take in. This could lead to thiamine deficiency. Interestingly, thiamine deficiency has been found in a group of people in rural Thailand who drink large amounts of tea (>1 liter per day) or chew fermented tea leaves long-term. However, this effect hasn't been found in Western populations, despite regular tea use. Researchers think the interaction between coffee and tea and thiamine may not be important unless the diet is low in thiamine or vitamin C. Vitamin C seems to prevent the interaction between thiamine and the tannins in coffee and tea.\nSeafood\nRaw freshwater fish and shellfish contain chemicals that destroy thiamine. Eating a lot of raw fish or shellfish can contribute to thiamine deficiency. However, cooked fish and seafood are OK. They don't have any effect on thiamine, since cooking destroys the chemicals that harm thiamine.\nWhat dose is used?\nThe following doses have been studied in scientific research:\nBY MOUTH:\nFor thiamine deficiency\n: The usual dose of thiamine is 5-30 mg daily in either a single dose or divided doses for one month. The typical dose for severe deficiency can be up to 300 mg per day.\nFor reducing the risk of getting cataracts\n: A daily dietary intake of approximately 10 mg of thiamine has been used.\nFor kidney damage in people with diabetes (diabetic nephropathy)\n: 100 mg of thiamine three times daily for 3 months has been used.\nFor menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea)\n: 100 mg of thiamine, alone or along with 500 mg of fish oil, has been used daily for up to 90 days.\nAs a dietary supplement in adults, 1-2 mg of thiamine per day is commonly used. The daily recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) of thiamine are: Infants 0-6 months, 0.2 mg; infants 7-12 months, 0.3 mg; children 1-3 years, 0.5 mg; children 4-8 years, 0.6 mg; boys 9-13 years, 0.9 mg; men 14 years and older, 1.2 mg; girls 9-13 years, 0.9 mg; women 14-18 years, 1 mg; women over 18 years, 1.1 mg; pregnant women, 1.4 mg; and breast-feeding women, 1.5 mg.\nBY INJECTION:\nFor a brain disorder caused by low levels of thiamine (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome)\n: Healthcare providers give shots containing 5-200 mg of thiamine once daily for 2 days.\nOther names\nAneurine Hydrochloride, Antiberiberi Factor, Antiberiberi Vitamin, Antineuritic Factor, Antineuritic Vitamin, B Complex Vitamin, Chlorhydrate de Thiamine, Chlorure de Thiamine, Complexe de Vitamine B, Facteur Anti-bÃ©ribÃ©ri, Facteur Antineuritique, Hydrochlorure de Thiamine, Mononitrate de Thiamine, Nitrate de Thiamine, Thiamine Chloride, Thiamine Disulfide, Thiamine HCl, Thiamine Hydrochloride, Thiamin Mononitrate, Thiamine Mononitrate, Thiamine Nitrate, Thiamine Pyrophosphate, Thiaminium Chloride Hydrochloride, Tiamina, Vitamin B1, Vitamin B-1, Vitamina B1, Vitamine Anti-bÃ©ribÃ©ri, Vitamine Antineuritique, Vitamine B1.\nMethodology\nTo learn more about how this article was written, please see the\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database\nmethodology\n.\n",

It is commonly used by mouth with glucosamine or other ingredients for osteoarthritis.\nChondroitin sulfate is one of the building blocks of cartilage. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage in the joints breaks down. Taking chondroitin sulfate might slow this breakdown. It is usually manufactured from animal sources, such as shark and cow cartilage. It can also be made in a lab.\nChondroitin sulfate is used for osteoarthritis and cataracts. It is often used together with other ingredients, including manganese ascorbate, hyaluronic acid, collagen peptides, or glucosamine. Chondroitin sulfate is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\nHow effective is it?\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database\nrates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\nThe effectiveness ratings for\nCHONDROITIN SULFATE\nare as follows:\nPossibly effective for...\nCataracts\n. An injectable solution containing chondroitin sulfate and sodium hyaluronate is approved by the FDA to protect the eye during cataract surgery. It is not clear if using it in a different form will help.\nOsteoarthritis\n. Taking chondroitin sulfate by mouth seems to provide some relief from osteoarthritis pain and improve function. High quality, pharmaceutical-grade products have shown the most benefit. Chondrosulf (IBSA Institut Biochimique SA), Chondrosan (Bioiberica, S.A.) and Structum (Laboratoires Pierre Fabre) are examples of these products.\nThere is interest in using chondroitin sulfate for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.\nIs it safe?\nWhen taken by mouth\n: Chondroitin sulfate is likely safe when used for up to 6 years. It can cause some mild stomach pain and nausea. Other possible side effects include bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.\nWhen placed into the eye\n: Chondroitin sulfate is possibly safe when used together with other ingredients in an eye drop.\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n: There isn't enough reliable information to know if chondroitin sulfate is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding.

        "right_answer": "Key Points\n                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood liver cancer.    - Children with liver cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of healthcare providers who are experts in treating this rare childhood cancer.    - Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.     - Six types of standard treatment are used:         - Surgery     - Watchful waiting     - Chemotherapy     - Radiation therapy     - Ablation therapy     - Antiviral treatment        - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.         - Targeted therapy        - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.\n                \n                \n                    There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood liver cancer.\n                    Different types of treatments are available for children with liver cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Taking part in a clinical trial should be considered for all children with liver cancer. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\n                \n                \n                    Children with liver cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of healthcare providers who are experts in treating this rare childhood cancer.\n                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with liver cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. It is especially important to have a pediatric surgeon with experience in liver surgery who can send patients to a liver transplant program if needed. Other specialists may include the following:         -  Pediatrician.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Psychologist.    -  Social worker.\n                \n                \n                    Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.\n                    Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include:          - Physical problems.     - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.     -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).\n                \n                \n                    Six types of standard treatment are used:\n                    Surgery    When possible, the cancer is removed by surgery.            - Partial hepatectomy: Removal of the part of the liver where cancer is found. The part removed may be a wedge of tissue, an entire lobe, or a larger part of the liver, along with a small amount of normal tissue around it.      - Total hepatectomy and liver transplant: Removal of the entire liver followed by a transplant of a healthy liver from a donor. A liver transplant may be possible when cancer has not spread beyond the liver and a donated liver can be found. If the patient has to wait for a donated liver, other treatment is given as needed.      -  Resection of metastases: Surgery to remove cancer that has spread outside of the liver, such as to nearby tissues, the lungs, or the brain.            Factors that affect the type of surgery used include the following:            - The PRETEXT group and POSTTEXT group.     - The size of the primary tumor.     - Whether there is more than one tumor in the liver.     - Whether the cancer has spread to nearby large blood vessels.     - The level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the blood.     - Whether the tumor can be shrunk by chemotherapy so that it can be removed by surgery.     - Whether a liver transplant is needed.           Chemotherapy is sometimes given before surgery, to shrink the tumor and make it easier to remove. This is called neoadjuvant therapy.    Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Watchful waiting     Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. In hepatoblastoma, this treatment is only used for small tumors that have been completely removed by surgery.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Treatment using more than one anticancer drug is called combination chemotherapy.      Chemoembolization of the hepatic artery (the main artery that supplies blood to the liver) is a type of regional chemotherapy used to treat childhood liver cancer. The anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube). The drug is mixed with a substance that blocks the artery, cutting off blood flow to the tumor. Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on the substance used to block the artery. The tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow. The liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine. This procedure is also called transarterial chemoembolization or TACE.    The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated and the PRETEXT or POSTTEXT group.        Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated and the PRETEXT or POSTTEXT group. Radioembolization of the hepatic artery (the main artery that supplies blood to the liver) is a type of internal radiation therapy used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. A very small amount of a radioactive substance is attached to tiny beads that are injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube). The beads are mixed with a substance that blocks the artery, cutting off blood flow to the tumor. Most of the radiation is trapped near the tumor to kill the cancer cells. This is done to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life for children with hepatocellular carcinoma. External radiation therapy is used to treat hepatoblastoma that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body.       Ablation therapy     Ablation therapy removes or destroys tissue. Different types of ablation therapy are used for liver cancer:             -  Radiofrequency ablation: The use of special needles that are inserted directly through the skin or through an incision in the abdomen to reach the tumor. High-energy radio waves heat the needles and tumor which kills cancer cells. Radiofrequency ablation is being used to treat recurrent hepatoblastoma.     -  Percutaneous ethanol injection: A small needle is used to inject ethanol (pure alcohol) directly into a tumor to kill cancer cells. Several treatments may be needed. Percutaneous ethanol injection is being used to treat recurrent hepatoblastoma.              Antiviral treatment    Hepatocellular carcinoma that is linked to the hepatitis B virus may be treated with antiviral drugs.\n                \n                \n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\n                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver and liver cancer that has come back.\n                \n                \n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\n                \n                \n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.\n                \n                \n                    Follow-up tests may be needed.\n                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the treatment group may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.\n                \n\t\t        \n\t\t            Treatment Options for Childhood Liver Cancer\n\t\t            \n\t\t                \n\t\t                    Hepatoblastoma\n\t\t                    Treatment options for hepatoblastoma that can be removed by surgery at the time of diagnosis may include the following:         -  Surgery to remove the tumor, followed by watchful waiting or chemotherapy, for hepatoblastoma with pure fetal histology.    - Surgery to remove the tumor, with combination chemotherapy given either before surgery, after surgery, or both, for hepatoblastoma that is not pure fetal histology. For hepatoblastoma with small cell undifferentiated histology, aggressive chemotherapy is given.        Treatment options for hepatoblastoma that cannot be removed by surgery or is not removed at the time of diagnosis may include the following:         - Combination chemotherapy to shrink the tumor, followed by surgery to remove the tumor.    - Combination chemotherapy followed by a liver transplant.    -  Chemoembolization of the hepatic artery to shrink the tumor, followed by surgery to remove the tumor.        For hepatoblastoma that has spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis, combination chemotherapy is given to shrink the cancer in the liver and cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. After chemotherapy, imaging tests are done to check whether the cancer can be removed by surgery.    Treatment options may include the following:         - If the cancer in the liver and other parts of the body can be removed, surgery will be done to remove the tumors followed by chemotherapy to kill any cancer cells that may remain.    - If the cancer in the liver cannot be removed by surgery but there are no signs of cancer in other parts of the body, the treatment may be a liver transplant.     - If the cancer in other parts of the body cannot be removed or a liver transplant is not possible, chemotherapy, chemoembolization of the hepatic artery, or radiation therapy may be given.        Treatment options in clinical trials for newly diagnosed hepatoblastoma include:         - A clinical trial of new treatment regimens based on how likely it is the cancer will recur after initial treatment.\n\t\t                \n\t\t                \n\t\t                    Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\t\t                    Treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma that can be removed by surgery at the time of diagnosis may include the following:         - Surgery alone to remove the tumor.    -  Surgery to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy.    -  Combination chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove the tumor.

        "question": "What are the stages of Endometrial Cancer ?",
        "right_answer": "Key Points\n                    - After endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body.    - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - The following stages are used for endometrial cancer:         - Stage I     - Stage II     - Stage III     - Stage IV        - Endometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:         - Low-risk endometrial cancer     - High-risk endometrial cancer\n                \n                \n                    After endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body.\n                    The process used to find out whether the cancer has spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Certain tests and procedures are used in the staging process. A hysterectomy (an operation in which the uterus is removed) will usually be done to treat endometrial cancer. Tissue samples are taken from the area around the uterus and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer to help find out whether the cancer has spread.   The following procedures may be used in the staging process:          -   Pelvic exam : An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A Pap test of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   Lymph node dissection : A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.\n                \n                \n                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\n                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.\n                \n                \n                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\n                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if endometrial cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually endometrial cancer cells. The disease is metastatic endometrial cancer, not lung cancer.\n                \n                \n                    The following stages are used for endometrial cancer:\n                    Stage I     In stage I, cancer is found in the uterus only. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB, based on how far the cancer has spread.             -  Stage IA: Cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (muscle layer of the uterus).     -  Stage IB: Cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium.              Stage II     In stage II, cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus.        Stage III    In stage III, cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix, but has not spread beyond the pelvis. Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis.            -  Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and ligaments of the uterus.      -  Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the vagina and/or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the uterus).     -  Stage IIIC: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (largest artery in the body, which carries blood away from the heart).              Stage IV    In stage IV, cancer has spread beyond the pelvis. Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB, based on how far the cancer has spread.            -  Stage IVA: Cancer has spread to the bladder and/or bowel wall.     -  Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body beyond the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin.\n                \n                \n                    Endometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:\n                    Low-risk endometrial cancer     Grades 1 and 2 tumors are usually considered low-risk. They usually do not spread to other parts of the body.       High-risk endometrial cancer     Grade 3 tumors are considered high-risk. They often spread to other parts of the body. Uterine papillary serous, clear cell, and carcinosarcoma are three subtypes of endometrial cancer that are considered grade 3.",
        "context": "Endometrial Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Endometrial Cancer\nKey Points\nEndometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)\n\t\t  cells form in the tissues of the endometrium.\nObesity and having metabolic syndrome may increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nTaking tamoxifen for breast cancer or taking estrogen alone\n\t\t  (without progesterone) can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nSigns and symptoms of endometrial cancer include unusual vaginal\n\t\t  bleeding or pain in the pelvis.\nTests that examine the endometrium are used to diagnose\n\t\t   endometrial cancer.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nEndometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)\n\t\t  cells form in the tissues of the endometrium.\nThe\nendometrium\nis the\n\t\t  lining of the\nuterus\n, a hollow, muscular\norgan\nin a woman’s\npelvis\n. The uterus is where a\nfetus\ngrows. In most nonpregnant\n\t\t  women, the uterus is about 3 inches long. The lower, narrow end of the uterus is the\ncervix\n, which leads  to the\nvagina\n.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium.\nCancer\nof the endometrium\n\t\t  is different from cancer of the muscle of the uterus, which is called\nsarcoma\nof the uterus. See the\nPDQ\nsummary on\nUterine Sarcoma Treatment\nfor more information about\nuterine sarcoma\n.\nObesity and having metabolic syndrome may increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nAnything that increases your chance of getting a disease\n\t\t  is called a\nrisk factor\n. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get\ncancer\n; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for\nendometrial cancer\n.\nRisk factors for endometrial cancer include the following:\nTaking\nestrogen-only hormone replacement therapy\n(HRT) after\nmenopause\n.\nTaking\ntamoxifen\nto\nprevent\nor treat\nbreast cancer\n.\nObesity\n.\nHaving\nmetabolic syndrome\n.\nHaving type 2\ndiabetes\n.\nExposure of endometrial\ntissue\nto\nestrogen\nmade by the body. This may be caused by:\nNever giving birth.\nMenstruating\nat an early age.\nStarting menopause at a later age.\nHaving\npolycystic ovary syndrome\n.\nHaving a\nfamily history\nof endometrial cancer in a\nfirst-degree relative\n(mother, sister, or daughter).\nHaving certain\ngenetic\nconditions\n, such as\nLynch syndrome\n.\nHaving\nendometrial hyperplasia\n.\nOlder age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.\nTaking tamoxifen for breast cancer or taking estrogen alone\n\t\t  (without progesterone) can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nEndometrial cancer\nmay develop in\nbreast cancer\npatients who have\n\t\t  been treated with\ntamoxifen\n. A\n\t\t  patient who takes this\ndrug\nand has\nabnormal\nvaginal\nbleeding should have a\nfollow-up\nexam and a\nbiopsy\nof the\nendometrial\nlining if needed. Women taking\nestrogen\n(a\nhormone\nthat can affect      the growth\n\t\t  of some cancers) alone also have an increased risk of endometrial cancer.\n\t\t  Taking estrogen combined with\nprogesterone\n(another hormone) does not increase a\n\t\t  woman’s risk of endometrial cancer.\nSigns and symptoms of endometrial cancer include unusual vaginal\n\t\t  bleeding or pain in the pelvis.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by endometrial cancer or by other conditions.\n\t\t   Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nVaginal bleeding or\ndischarge\nnot related to\n\t\t\t menstruation (periods).\nVaginal bleeding after menopause.\nDifficult or painful\nurination\n.\nPain during sexual intercourse.\nPain in the\npelvic\narea.\nTests that examine the endometrium are used to diagnose\n\t\t   endometrial cancer.\nBecause endometrial cancer begins inside the uterus, it does not\n\t\t  usually show up in the results of a\nPap\n\t\t  test\n. For this reason, a sample of endometrial\ntissue\nmust be removed and checked\n\t\t  under a\nmicroscope\nto look for cancer\ncells\n. One of the following procedures may be\n\t\t  used:\nEndometrial biopsy\n: The removal of tissue from the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) by inserting a thin, flexible tube through the cervix and into the uterus.  The tube is used to gently scrape a small amount of tissue from the endometrium and then remove the tissue samples.  A\npathologist\nviews the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.\nDilatation and curettage\n:  A procedure to remove samples of tissue from the inner lining of the uterus.  The cervix is\ndilated\nand a\ncurette\n(spoon-shaped instrument) is inserted into the uterus to remove tissue.   The tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of disease.  This procedure is also called a D&C.\nEnlarge\nDilatation and curettage (D and C). A speculum is inserted into the vagina to widen it in order to look at the cervix (first panel). A dilator is used to widen the cervix (middle panel). A curette is put through the cervix into the uterus to scrape out abnormal tissue (last panel).\nHysteroscopy\n: A procedure to look inside the uterus for abnormal areas. A hysteroscope is inserted through the vagina and cervix into the uterus. A hysteroscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a\nlens\nfor viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.\nOther tests and procedures used to\ndiagnose\nendometrial cancer include the following:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nTransvaginal ultrasound\nexam\n: A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus,\nfallopian tubes\n, and\nbladder\n. An\nultrasound transducer\n(probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. The doctor can identify\ntumors\nby looking at the sonogram.\nEnlarge\nTransvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe\nstage\nof the cancer (whether it is in the endometrium only, involves the uterus wall, or has spread to other places in the body).\nHow the cancer cells look under a microscope.\nWhether the cancer cells are affected by progesterone.\nEndometrial cancer can usually be\ncured\nbecause it is usually diagnosed early.\nStages of Endometrial Cancer\nKey Points\nAfter endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are\n\t\t  done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other\n\t\t  parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for endometrial\n\t\t  cancer:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nEndometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:\nLow-risk endometrial cancer\nHigh-risk endometrial cancer\nEndometrial cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nAfter endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are\n\t\t  done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other\n\t\t  parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out whether the\ncancer\nhas spread within the\nuterus\nor to other parts of the body\n\t\t  is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the\n\t\t  staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important\n\t\t  to know the stage  in\n\t\t  order to plan treatment. Certain tests and procedures are used in the staging process. A\nhysterectomy\n(an operation in\n\t\t  which the uterus is removed) will usually be done to treat\nendometrial cancer\n.\nTissue\nsamples are taken from the area around the uterus and checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor\nsigns\nof cancer to help find out whether the\n\t\t  cancer has spread.\nThe following procedures may be used in the staging process:\nPelvic exam\n: An exam of the\nvagina\n,\ncervix\n, uterus,\nfallopian tubes\n,\novaries\n, and\nrectum\n.    A\nspeculum\nis inserted into the vagina and the doctor or\nnurse\nlooks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A\nPap test\nof the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two\nlubricated\n, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower\nabdomen\nto feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or\nabnormal\nareas.\nEnlarge\nPelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.\nChest x-ray\n: An\nx-ray\nof the\norgans\nand bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor\ncells\nin the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nLymph node dissection\n: A surgical procedure in which the\nlymph nodes\nare removed from the\npelvic\narea and  a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  endometrial cancer spreads to the\nlung\n, the cancer cells in the lung are actually endometrial cancer cells. The disease is metastatic endometrial cancer, not lung cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for endometrial\n\t\t  cancer:\nStage I\nEnlarge\nStage IA and stage IB endometrial cancer. In stage IA, cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (the muscle layer of the uterus). In stage IB, cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium.\nIn\nstage I\n,\ncancer\nis\n\t\t\t found in the\nuterus\nonly.  Stage I is divided\n\t\t\t into stages IA and IB, based on how far the cancer has spread.\nStage IA\n:\nCancer\nis in the\nendometrium\nonly or less than halfway through the\nmyometrium\n(muscle layer of the\nuterus\n).\nStage IB\n:\nCancer\nhas spread halfway or more into the\nmyometrium\n.\nStage II\nEnlarge\nStage II endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus.\nIn\nstage II\n,\ncancer\nhas spread into\nconnective tissue\nof the\ncervix\n, but has not spread outside the\nuterus\n.\nStage III\nIn\nstage III\n,\ncancer\nhas spread beyond the\nuterus\nand\ncervix\n, but has not spread beyond the\npelvis\n. Stage III is divided into\n\t\t\t stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, based on  how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis.\nStage IIIA\n:\nCancer\nhas spread to the outer layer of the\nuterus\nand/or to the\nfallopian tubes\n,\novaries\n, and ligaments of the uterus.\nEnlarge\nStage IIIA endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, or ligaments of the uterus.\nStage IIIB\n:\nCancer\nhas spread to the\nvagina\nand/or to the\nparametrium\n(\nconnective tissue\nand fat around the\nuterus\n).\nEnlarge\nStage IIIB endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread to the vagina and/or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the uterus and cervix).\nStage IIIC\n:\nCancer\nhas spread to\nlymph nodes\nin the\npelvis\nand/or around the\naorta\n(largest\nartery\nin the body, which carries\nblood\naway from the heart).\nEnlarge\nStage IIIC endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (the largest artery in the body that carries blood away from the heart).\nStage IV\nIn\nstage IV\n,\ncancer\nhas spread beyond the\npelvis\n. Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB,\n\t\t\t based on  how far the cancer has spread.\nStage IVA\n:\nCancer\nhas spread to the\nbladder\nand/or\nbowel\nwall.\nEnlarge\nStage IVA endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread into the bladder and/or bowel.\nStage IVB\n:\nCancer\nhas spread to other parts of the body beyond the\npelvis\n, including the\nabdomen\nand/or\nlymph nodes\nin the\ngroin\n.\nEnlarge\nStage IVB endometrial cancer. The cancer has spread to parts of the body outside the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin.\nEndometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:\nLow-risk endometrial cancer\nGrades\n1 and 2\ntumors\nare usually considered low-risk.  They  usually do not spread to other parts of the body.\nHigh-risk endometrial cancer\nGrade\n3\ntumors\nare considered high-risk.  They often spread to other parts of the body. Uterine\npapillary serous\n,\nclear cell\n, and\ncarcinosarcoma\nare three subtypes of\nendometrial cancer\nthat are considered grade 3.\nEndometrial cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nThe cancer may come back in the\nuterus\n, the\npelvis\n, in\nlymph nodes\nin the\nabdomen\n, or in other parts of the\n\t\tbody.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial\n\t\t  cancer.\nFive types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nHormone therapy\nTargeted therapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nTreatment for endometrial cancer may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial\n\t\t  cancer.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\nendometrial\n\t\t  cancer\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some\n\t\t  are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.\n\t\t  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help\n\t\t  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients\n\t\t  with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nFive types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery\n(removing the cancer in\n\t\t\t an operation) is the most common treatment for endometrial cancer. The\n\t\t\t following surgical procedures may be used:\nTotal hysterectomy\n: Surgery to remove the\nuterus\n, including the\ncervix\n.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the\nvagina\n, the operation is called a\nvaginal\nhysterectomy\n.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large\nincision\n(cut) in the\nabdomen\n, the operation is called a total\nabdominal\nhysterectomy.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a\nlaparoscope\n, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.\nEnlarge\nHysterectomy. The uterus is surgically removed with or without other organs or tissues. In a total hysterectomy, the uterus and cervix are removed. In a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy, (a) the uterus plus one (unilateral) ovary and fallopian tube are removed; or (b) the uterus plus both (bilateral) ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed. In a radical hysterectomy, the uterus, cervix, both ovaries, both fallopian tubes, and nearby tissue are removed. These procedures are done using a low transverse incision or a vertical incision.\nBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n: Surgery to remove both\novaries\nand both\nfallopian\n\t\t\t\ttubes\n.\nRadical hysterectomy\n: Surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and part of the vagina.  The ovaries, fallopian tubes, or nearby\nlymph nodes\nmay also be removed.\nLymph node dissection\n: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the\npelvic\narea and  a sample of\ntissue\nis checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor\nsigns\nof cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the\n\t\t\t time of the  surgery, some patients may be given\nradiation therapy\nor\nhormone treatment\nafter surgery to kill any cancer\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given\n\t\t\t after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer.\nThe way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and\nstage\nof the cancer being treated.  External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat endometrial cancer, and may also be used as\npalliative therapy\nto relieve\nsymptoms\nand improve\nquality of life\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n, an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n).\nThe way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.\nHormone therapy\nHormone therapy\nis a cancer treatment that removes\nhormones\nor blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are  substances made by\nglands\nin the body and circulated in the bloodstream.          Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (\nreceptors\n),\ndrugs\n, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.\nMonoclonal antibodies\n,\nmTOR inhibitors\n, and\nsignal transduction inhibitors\nare three types of targeted therapy used to treat endometrial cancer.\nMonoclonal antibody therapy: Monoclonal\nantibodies\nare\nimmune system\nproteins\nmade in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these antibodies can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by\ninfusion\n. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.\nBevacizumab\nis used to treat\nstage III\n,\nstage IV\n, and\nrecurrent\nendometrial cancer.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nmTOR inhibitor therapy: mTOR inhibitors block a protein called\nmTOR\n, which helps control cell division. mTOR inhibitors may keep cancer cells from growing and\nprevent\nthe growth of new\nblood vessels\nthat\ntumors\nneed to grow.\nEverolimus\nand ridaforolimus are used to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.\nSignal transduction inhibitor therapy: Signal transduction inhibitors block\nsignals\nthat are passed from one\nmolecule\nto another inside a cell. Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells.\nMetformin\nis being studied to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nInformation about\nclinical trials\nis available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for endometrial cancer may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.

        "hallucinated_answer": "After endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body. The process used to find out whether the cancer has spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Certain tests and procedures are used in the staging process. A hysterectomy (an operation in which the uterus is removed) is performed.\n\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if endometrial cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually endometrial cancer cells. The disease is metastatic endometrial cancer, not lung cancer.\n\nThe following stages are used for endometrial cancer:\n- Stage I: Cancer is found in the uterus only. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB, based on how far the cancer has spread. In stage IA, cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (muscle layer of the uterus). In stage IB, cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium.\n- Stage II: Cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus.\n- Stage III: Cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix, but has not spread beyond the pelvis. Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis. In stage IIIA, cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and ligaments of the uterus. In stage IIIB, cancer has spread to the vagina and/or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the uterus). In stage IIIC, cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (largest artery in the body, which carries blood away from the heart).\n- Stage IV: Cancer has spread beyond the pelvis. Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB, based on how far the cancer has spread. In stage IVA, cancer has spread to the bladder and/or bowel wall. In stage IVB, cancer has spread to other parts of the body beyond the"

        "context": "Colorectal Cancer Prevention (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nWhat is prevention?\nCancer\nprevention\nis action taken to lower the chance of getting cancer. By preventing cancer,  the number of new cases of cancer in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower the number of deaths caused by cancer.\nTo prevent new cancers from starting,\nscientists\nlook at\nrisk factors\nand\nprotective factors\n. Anything that increases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer protective factor.\nSome risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. For\n\t\texample, both smoking and inheriting certain\ngenes\nare risk factors for some\n\t\ttypes of cancer, but only smoking can be avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy\ndiet\nmay be protective factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors  may lower your  risk, but it does\n\t\tnot mean that you will not get cancer.\nDifferent ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including:\nChanging lifestyle or eating habits.\nAvoiding things known to cause cancer.\nTaking\nmedicines\nto treat a\nprecancerous\ncondition\nor to keep cancer from starting.\nGeneral Information About Colorectal Cancer\nKey Points\nColorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)\n\t\t  cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum.\nColorectal cancer is the third leading cause of death from\n\t\t\t cancer in the United States.\nColorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)\n\t\t  cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum.\nThe\ncolon\nis part of the body's\ndigestive system\n. The digestive system removes and\n\t\t  processes\nnutrients\n(\nvitamins\n,\nminerals\n,\ncarbohydrates\n, fats,\nproteins\n, and\n\t\t  water) from foods and helps pass waste material out of the body. The digestive\n\t\t  system is made up of the mouth,\nthroat\n,\nesophagus\n,\nstomach\n, and the\nsmall\nand\nlarge intestines\n. The colon (large\nbowel\n) is the first part of the large intestine and is about 5 feet long. Together, the\nrectum\nand\nanal\ncanal make up the last part of the large intestine and are 6 to 8 inches long. The anal canal ends at the\nanus\n(the opening of the large intestine to\n\t\t  the outside of the body).\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the lower gastrointestinal (digestive) system showing  the colon, rectum, and anus. Other organs that make up the digestive system are also shown.\nCancer\nthat begins in the colon is called\ncolon cancer\n, and cancer\n\t\t  that begins in the rectum is called\nrectal cancer\n. Cancer that affects either of\n\t\t  these\norgans\nmay also be called\ncolorectal cancer\n.\nSee the following\nPDQ\nsummaries for more information about  colorectal  cancer:\nColorectal Cancer Screening\nColon Cancer Treatment\nRectal Cancer Treatment\nGenetics of Colorectal Cancer\nColorectal cancer is the third leading cause of death from\n\t\t\t cancer in the United States.\nBetween  2011 and 2019, the number of new colorectal cancer cases in the United States decreased slightly per year in people aged 50 years and older, but increased slightly  per year in people younger than 50 years. For the past 20 years, the rate of deaths from colorectal cancer has been decreasing in both men and women. The number of new cases  and the number of deaths are higher in Black people compared with other races; however, studies have  found no evidence that Black people have higher rates of precancerous lesions.\nFinding and treating colorectal cancer early may prevent death from colorectal cancer.\nScreening\ntests may be used to help find colorectal cancer.\nColorectal Cancer Prevention\nKey Points\nAvoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may\n\t\t  help     prevent cancer.\nThe following\nrisk\nfactors increase the risk of colorectal cancer:\nAge\nFamily history of colorectal cancer\nPersonal history\nInherited risk\nAlcohol\nCigarette smoking\nRace\nObesity\nThe following\nprotective\nfactors decrease the risk of colorectal cancer:\nPhysical activity\nAspirin\nCombination hormone replacement therapy\nPolyp removal\nIt is not clear if the following affect the risk of colorectal cancer:\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) other than aspirin\nCalcium\nDiet\nThe following factors do not affect the risk of colorectal cancer:\nHormone replacement therapy with estrogen only\nStatins\nCancer prevention  clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.\nNew ways to prevent colorectal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.\nAvoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may\n\t\t  help     prevent cancer.\nAvoiding\ncancer\nrisk factors\nmay help\nprevent\ncertain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, having\noverweight\n, and not getting enough exercise.  Increasing\nprotective factors\nsuch as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.\nThe following\nrisk\nfactors increase the risk of colorectal cancer:\nAge\nThe  risk of\ncolorectal cancer\nincreases after age 50. Most cases of colorectal cancer are\ndiagnosed\nafter age 50.\nFamily history of colorectal cancer\nHaving a  parent, brother, sister, or child with colorectal cancer doubles a person's  risk of colorectal cancer.\nPersonal history\nHaving a\npersonal history\nof the following\nconditions\nincreases the risk of colorectal cancer:\nPrevious colorectal cancer.\nHigh-risk\nadenomas\n(colorectal\npolyps\nthat are 1\ncentimeter\nor larger in size or that have cells that look\nabnormal\nunder a\nmicroscope\n).\nOvarian cancer\n.\nInflammatory bowel disease\n(such as\nulcerative colitis\nor\nCrohn disease\n).\nInherited risk\nThe risk of colorectal cancer is increased when certain\ngene\nchanges linked to\nfamilial adenomatous polyposis\n(FAP) or\nhereditary nonpolyposis colon\n\t\t\t cancer\n(HNPCC or Lynch Syndrome) are\ninherited\n.\nAlcohol\nDrinking 3 or more\nalcoholic\nbeverages  per day increases the risk of \n\t\t\t colorectal cancer. Drinking alcohol is also linked to  the risk of forming large colorectal\nadenomas\n(benign tumors).\nCigarette smoking\nCigarette smoking is linked to  an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer.\nSmoking cigarettes is also linked  to an increased risk of\n\t\t\t forming  colorectal adenomas. Cigarette smokers who have had\nsurgery\nto remove colorectal adenomas are at an increased risk for the adenomas to\nrecur\n(come back).\nRace\nBlack individuals have an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer compared to other races.\nObesity\nObesity\nis linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer  and death from colorectal cancer.\nThe following\nprotective\nfactors decrease the risk of colorectal cancer:\nPhysical activity\nA lifestyle that includes regular physical activity is linked to  a decreased risk of colorectal cancer.\nAspirin\nStudies have shown that taking aspirin daily for at least two years lowers the risk of colorectal cancer and the risk of death from colorectal cancer. The decrease in risk begins 10 to 20 years after patients start taking aspirin.\nThe possible harms of aspirin use (100 mg or less) daily or every other day include an increased risk of stroke and bleeding in the\nstomach\nand\nintestines\n. These risks may be greater among the elderly, men, and those  with conditions linked to  a higher than normal risk of   bleeding.\nCombination hormone replacement therapy\nStudies\nhave shown that combination\nhormone replacement therapy\n(HRT)  that includes both\nestrogen\nand\nprogestin\nlowers the risk of\ninvasive\ncolorectal cancer\nin\npostmenopausal\nwomen.\nHowever, in women who take combination HRT and do develop colorectal cancer, the\ncancer\nis more likely to be\nadvanced\nwhen it is diagnosed and the risk of dying from colorectal cancer is not decreased.\nThe possible harms of combination HRT include an increased risk of having:\nBreast cancer\n.\nHeart disease.\nBlood clots\n.\nPolyp removal\nMost colorectal polyps are adenomas, which may develop into cancer.  Removing colorectal polyps that are larger than 1\ncentimeter\n(pea-sized) may lower the risk of colorectal cancer. It is not known if removing smaller polyps lowers the risk of colorectal cancer.\nThe possible harms of polyp removal during\ncolonoscopy\nor\nsigmoidoscopy\ninclude a tear in the wall of the\ncolon\nand bleeding.\nEnlarge\nPolyps in the colon.  Some polyps have a stalk and others do not.  Inset shows a photo of a polyp with a stalk.\nIt is not clear if the following affect the risk of colorectal cancer:\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) other than aspirin\nIt is not known if the use of\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nor NSAIDs (such as\nsulindac\n,\ncelecoxib\n,\nnaproxen\n, and\nibuprofen\n) lowers the risk of colorectal cancer.\nStudies have shown that taking the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug  celecoxib reduces the  risk of colorectal adenomas (benign tumors)    coming back after they have been removed. It is not clear if this results in a lower risk of colorectal cancer.\nTaking sulindac or celecoxib has been shown to reduce the number and size of polyps that form in the colon and\nrectum\nof people with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). It is not clear if this results in a lower risk of colorectal cancer.\nThe possible harms  of NSAIDs include:\nKidney\nproblems.\nBleeding in the stomach, intestines, or brain.\nHeart problems such as heart attack and\ncongestive heart failure\n.\nCalcium\nIt is not known if taking\ncalcium\nsupplements\nlowers the risk of colorectal cancer.\nDiet\nIt is not known if a\ndiet\nlow in fat and meat and high in\nfiber\n, fruits, and vegetables lowers the risk of colorectal cancer.\nSome studies have shown that a diet high in fat,\nproteins\n,\ncalories\n, and meat increases the risk of colorectal cancer, but other studies have not.\nThe following factors do not affect the risk of colorectal cancer:\nHormone replacement therapy with estrogen only\nHormone replacement therapy with estrogen only does not lower the risk of having invasive colorectal cancer or the risk of dying from colorectal cancer.\nStatins\nStudies have shown that taking\nstatins\n(\ndrugs\nthat lower\ncholesterol\n) does not increase or decrease the risk of colorectal cancer.\nCancer prevention  clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.\nCancer prevention\nclinical trials\nare used to  study ways to lower the risk\n\t\t\t of developing certain types of cancer.

        "question": "How to diagnose Childhood Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors ?",
        "right_answer": "Imaging studies and blood tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood extracranial germ cell tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. The testicles may be checked for lumps, swelling, or pain. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers.  Most malignant germ cell tumors release tumor markers. The following tumor markers are used to detect extracranial germ cell tumors:                - Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).      - Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG).          For testicular germ cell tumors, blood levels of the tumor markers help show if the tumor is a seminoma or nonseminoma.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. In some cases, the tumor is removed during surgery and then a biopsy is done. The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:               -  Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.       -  Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.",

Some ovarian germ cell tumors, such as\nimmature teratomas\n,\ndysgerminomas\n,\nyolk sac tumors\n, or\nmixed germ cell tumors\n,  are malignant.\nExtragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors\nExtragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors\nform in areas of the body other than the brain or gonads (testicles and ovaries).\nMost extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors  form along the midline of the body. This includes the following:\nSacrum (the large, triangle-shaped bone in the lower\nspine\nthat forms part of the\npelvis\n).\nCoccyx (tailbone).\nMediastinum (the area between the lungs).\nBack of the abdomen.\nNeck.\nIn children younger than 11 years, extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors usually occur at birth or in early childhood. Most of these tumors are benign\nteratomas\nin the sacrum or coccyx.\nIn older children, adolescents, and young adults (11 years and older), extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors are often in the mediastinum.\nThere are three types of extracranial germ cell tumors.\nExtracranial germ cell tumors are also grouped into teratomas, malignant germ cell tumors, and\nmixed germ cell tumors\n:\nTeratomas\nThere are two main types of teratomas:\nMature teratomas.\nThese tumors are the most common type of extracranial germ cell tumor. Mature teratomas are\nbenign tumors\nand not likely to become cancer. They usually occur in the sacrum or coccyx in newborns or in the testicles or ovaries  at the start of\npuberty\n. The cells of mature teratomas look almost like normal cells under a\nmicroscope\n. Some mature teratomas release\nenzymes\nor\nhormones\nthat cause signs and symptoms of disease.\nImmature teratomas.\nThese tumors usually occur in areas other than the gonads in young children or in the ovaries at the start of puberty. They have cells that look very different from normal cells under a microscope. Immature teratomas may be cancer and spread to other parts of the body. They often have several different types of tissue in them, such as hair, muscle, and bone. Some immature teratomas  release enzymes or hormones that cause signs and symptoms of disease.\nMalignant germ cell tumors\nMalignant germ cell tumors are cancer. There are two main types of malignant germ cell tumors:\nSeminomatous germ cell tumors.\nThere are three types of seminomatous germ cell tumors:\nSeminomas form in the testicle.\nDysgerminomas form in the\novary\n.\nGerminomas form in areas of the body that are not the ovary or testicle, such as the mediastinum.\nNonseminomatous germ cell tumors.\nThere are four types of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors:\nYolk sac tumors make a hormone called\nalpha-fetoprotein\n(AFP). They can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body.\nChoriocarcinomas\nmake a hormone called\nbeta-human chorionic gonadotropin\n(beta-hCG). They can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body.\nEmbryonal\ncarcinomas\nmay make a hormone called beta-hCG. They can form in the testicle or other areas of the body, but not in the ovary.\nGonadoblastomas\ncan form in the ovary.\nMixed germ cell tumors\nMixed germ cell tumors are made up of at least two types of malignant germ cell tumor. They can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body.\nThe cause of most  childhood extracranial germ cell tumors is unknown.\nHaving certain inherited disorders can increase the risk of extracranial germ cell tumors.\nAnything that increases a person's risk of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Not every child with one or more of these risk factors will develop an extracranial germ cell tumor, and it will develop in some children who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your child’s doctor if you think your child may be at risk.\nPossible risk factors for extracranial germ cell tumors include the following:\nHaving certain\ngenetic\nsyndromes\n:\nKlinefelter syndrome\nmay increase the risk of germ cell tumors in the mediastinum.\nSwyer syndrome\nmay increase the  risk of gonadoblastoma and seminoma.\nTurner syndrome\nmay increase the risk of gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma.\nHaving an\nundescended testicle\nmay increase the risk of\ntesticular cancer\n.\nHaving\ngonadal dysgenesis\n(the gonad—ovary or testicle—has not formed normally) may increase the risk of gonadoblastoma.\nSigns of childhood extracranial germ cell tumors depend on where the tumor formed in the body.\nDifferent  tumors may cause the following signs and symptoms. \nOther\nconditions\nmay cause these same signs and symptoms. Check with a doctor if your child has any of the following:\nA lump in the neck, abdomen, or lower back.\nA painless lump in the testicle.\nPain in the abdomen or back.\nRespiratory distress, chest pain, or cough.\nFever\n.\nConstipation\n.\nTrouble urinating.\nEarly\npuberty\n.\nIn females, no\nmenstrual periods\nor unusual\nvaginal\nbleeding.\nImaging studies and blood tests are used to diagnose childhood extracranial germ cell tumors.\nIn addition to asking about your child's\npersonal\nand\nfamily medical history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your child's doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nSerum tumor marker test\n: A procedure in which a sample of\nblood\nis checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called\ntumor markers\n.\nSome malignant germ cell tumors release tumor markers.  The following tumor markers may be used to detect extracranial germ cell tumors:\nAlpha-fetoprotein (AFP).\nBeta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG).\nFor testicular germ cell tumors, blood levels of the tumor markers help show if the tumor is a seminoma or nonseminoma.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body, including\nlactate dehydrogenase\n. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nChest x-ray\n: An\nx-ray\nof the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest or\nlymph nodes\n, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nEnlarge\nComputed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nEnlarge\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.\nUltrasound\nexam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.\nEnlarge\nAbdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound transducer connected to a computer is pressed against the skin of the abdomen. The transducer bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nBiopsy\n: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. Sometimes an\nincisional biopsy\nor\nneedle biopsy\nis done before\nsurgery\nto remove a sample of tissue. Sometimes the tumor is removed during surgery and then a sample of tissue is removed from the tumor.\nThe following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help\ndiagnose\ncancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nImmunohistochemistry\n:  A laboratory test that uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an enzyme or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe patient's age and general health.\nThe\nstage\nof the cancer (whether it has spread to nearby areas, lymph nodes, or to other places in the body).\nWhere the tumor first began to grow.\nThe type of germ cell tumor.\nHow well the tumor\nresponds\nto treatment.\nWhether the patient has gonadal dysgenesis.\nWhether the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.\nWhether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nThe prognosis for childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, especially ovarian germ cell tumors, is good.\nStages of Childhood Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors\nKey Points\nAfter a childhood extracranial germ cell tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread from where the tumor started to nearby areas or to other parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nStages are used to describe the different types of extracranial germ cell tumors.\nTesticular germ cell tumors  in patients younger than 11 years\nTesticular germ cell tumors in patients 11 years and older\nOvarian germ cell tumors\nExtragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors\nChildhood extracranial germ cell tumors usually do not come back after treatment.\nAfter a childhood extracranial germ cell tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread from where the tumor started to nearby areas or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread from where the\ntumor\nstarted to other\nparts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the\nstaging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know\nthe stage in order to plan treatment. In some cases, staging may follow\nsurgery\nto remove the tumor.\nThe following procedures may be used:\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain or\nlymph nodes\n. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest or lymph nodes, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the\norgans\nor\ntissues\nshow up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nBone scan\n: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing\ncells\n, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of\nradioactive\nmaterial is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a\nscanner\n.\nThoracentesis\n: The removal of\nfluid\nfrom the space between the lining of the chest and the\nlung\n, using a needle. A\npathologist\nviews the fluid under a\nmicroscope\nto look for cancer cells.\nParacentesis\n: The removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the\nabdomen\nand the organs in the abdomen, using a needle. A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.\nThe results from\ntests and procedures\nused to detect and\ndiagnose\nchildhood\nextracranial germ cell tumors\nmay also be used in staging.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe\nmetastatic\ntumor is the same type of cancer as the\nprimary tumor\n. For example, if  an extracranial germ cell tumor spreads to the\nliver\n, the cancer cells in the liver are actually cancerous\ngerm cells\n. The disease is metastatic extracranial germ cell tumor, not\nliver cancer\n.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nStages are used to describe the different types of extracranial germ cell tumors.\nTesticular germ cell tumors  in patients younger than 11 years\nThe following stages are from the Children's Oncology Group.\nStage I\nIn stage I,  the\ncancer\nis found in the\ntesticle\nonly. The testicle and\nspermatic cord\nare  completely removed by\nsurgery\nand all of the following are true:\nthe\ncapsule\n(outer covering of the\ntumor\n) did not rupture (break open) and a\nbiopsy\nwas not done before the tumor was removed; and\nall\nlymph nodes\nare smaller  than 1\ncentimeter\nin their shortest\ndiameter\non a\nCT scan\nor\nMRI\n.\nStage II\nIn stage II, the\ntesticle\nand\nspermatic cord\nare removed by\nsurgery\nand one of the following is true:\nthe\ncapsule\n(outer covering of the\ntumor\n) ruptured (broke open) or a\nbiopsy\nwas done before surgery; or\ncancer\nthat can only be seen with a\nmicroscope\nremains in the\nscrotum\nor in the spermatic cord near the scrotum and after surgery\ntumor marker\nlevels do not return to normal or do not decrease.\nCancer has not spread to the\nlymph nodes\n.\nStage III\nIn stage III, one of the following is true:\nthe\ncancer\nhas spread to one or more\nlymph nodes\nat  the back of the\nabdomen\n; or\nlymph nodes are  at least 2\ncentimeters\nwide or  are larger than 1 centimeter but smaller than 2 centimeters in their shortest\ndiameter\nand either have not changed or are growing   when a\nCT scan\nor\nMRI\nis repeated within 4 to 6 weeks.\nStage IV\nIn stage IV, the\ncancer\nhas spread to other parts of the body, such as the\nliver\n,\nlung\n, bone, and brain.\nTesticular germ cell tumors in patients 11 years and older\nIn males older than 15 years, there are only stage I tumors and metastatic tumors. See the\nPDQ\nsummary on\nTesticular Cancer Treatment\nfor more information about staging used for\ntesticular germ cell tumors\nin patients 11 years and older.\nOvarian germ cell tumors\nTwo staging systems are used for\novarian germ cell tumors\n: Children's Oncology Group and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO).\nThe following stages are from the Children's Oncology Group.\nStage I\nIn stage I, the\ntumor\nin the\novary\nis completely removed by\nsurgery\nand all of the following are true:\nthe\ncapsule\n(outer covering of the tumor) did not rupture (break open) and a\nbiopsy\nwas not done before the tumor was removed; and\nthere is  no sign that the\ncancer\nhas spread through the capsule; and\nno cancer\ncells\nare found in\nfluid\ntaken from the\nabdomen\n; and\nno cancer is seen  in\ntissue\nthat lines the abdomen or found in tissue samples taken during a biopsy; and\nlymph nodes\nare smaller than 1\ncentimeter\nin their shortest\ndiameter\non a\nCT scan\nor\nMRI\nor no cancer is found in lymph node tissue samples taken during a biopsy.\nStage II\nIn stage II, the\ntumor\nin the\novary\nis completely removed by\nsurgery\nand a\nbiopsy\nis done before surgery and one of the following is true:\ncancer\nhas spread through part or all of the\ncapsule\n(outer covering of the tumor); or\nthe tumor is larger than 10\ncentimeters\nand is removed by\nlaparoscopic surgery\n; or\nthe tumor is removed by being broken up into small pieces and it is not known if cancer has spread through the capsule.\nCancer\ncells\nare not found in\nfluid\ntaken from the\nabdomen\n. Cancer is not seen in\nlymph nodes\nor\ntissue\nthat lines the abdomen and cancer is not found in   tissue samples taken during a biopsy.\nStage III\nIn stage III, there is\ntumor\nin the\novary\nand one of the following is true:\nlymph nodes\nare  at least 2\ncentimeters\nwide or  are larger than 1 centimeter but smaller than 2 centimeters in their shortest\ndiameter\nand either have not changed or are growing   when a\nCT scan\nor\nMRI\nis repeated 4 to 6 weeks after surgery; or\nthe tumor is not completely removed by surgery or a\nbiopsy\nwas done before surgery; or\ncancer\ncells\n(including\nimmature teratoma\n) are found in\nfluid\ntaken from the\nabdomen\n; or\ncancer (including immature teratoma) is found in lymph nodes; or\ncancer (including immature teratoma) is found in\ntissue\nthat lines the abdomen.\nStage III-X\nIn stage III-X, the\ntumor\ncan be described as stage I or stage II, except:\ncells\nlining the\nabdomen\nwere not collected; or\na\nbiopsy\nof\nlymph nodes\nlarger than 1\ncentimeter\nin their shortest\ndiameter\nwas not done; or\na biopsy of\ntissue\nfrom the lining of the abdomen was not done; or\nstaging\nwas not completed during\nsurgery\nbut will be completed during a second surgery.\nStage IV\nIn stage IV, one of the following is true:\nthe\ncancer\nhas spread to the\nliver\nor outside the\nabdomen\nto other areas of the body, such as the bone,\nlung\n, or brain.\ncancer\ncells\nare found in the\nfluid\nin the lung.\nThe following stages are from the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO).\nStage I\nIn stage I,\ncancer\nis found in one or both of the\novaries\nand has not spread. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IC.\nStage IA: Cancer is found in one ovary.\nStage IB: Cancer is found in both ovaries.\nStage IC: Cancer is found in one or both ovaries and one of the following is true:\ncancer is also found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries; or\nthe\ncapsule\n(outer covering) of the\ntumor\nruptured (broke open) before or during\nsurgery\n; or\ncancer\ncells\nare found in\nfluid\ntaken from the\nabdomen\nor in\nwashings\nof the\nperitoneal cavity\n(the body\ncavity\nthat contains most of the\norgans\nin the abdomen).\nStage II\nIn stage II,\ncancer\nis found in one or both\novaries\nand has spread into other areas of the\npelvis\n,   or\nprimary peritoneal cancer\nis found. Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB.\nStage IIA: Cancer has spread to the\nuterus\nand/or the\nfallopian tubes\n(the long slender tubes through which eggs pass from the ovaries to the uterus).\nStage IIB: Cancer has spread to other\ntissue\nwithin the\npelvis\nsuch as the\nbladder\n,\nrectum\n, or\nvagina\n.\nStage III\nIn stage III,\ncancer\nis found in one or both\novaries\nor\nprimary peritoneal cancer\nis found. Cancer has spread outside the\npelvis\nto other parts of the\nabdomen\nand/or to\nlymph nodes\nat the back of the abdomen.\n\nStage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC.\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).\nIn stage IIIA, one of the following is true:\ncancer has spread to lymph nodes at the back of the abdomen only;      or\ncancer\ncells\nthat can be seen only with a\nmicroscope\nhave spread to the surface of the\nperitoneum\noutside the pelvis. Cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes at the back of the abdomen.\nStage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis and the cancer in the peritoneum is 2\ncentimeters\nor smaller. Cancer may have spread to lymph nodes at the back of the abdomen.\nStage IIIC: Cancer has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis and the cancer in the peritoneum is\n\t\t\t\tlarger than 2 centimeters. Cancer may have spread to\n\t\t\t\tlymph nodes at the back of the abdomen or to the surface of the\nliver\nor\nspleen\n.\nStage IV\nStage IV is divided into stage IVA and IVB.\nStage IVA:\nCancer\ncells\nare found in  extra\nfluid\nthat builds up  around the\nlungs\n.\nStage IVB: Cancer has spread to\norgans\nand\ntissues\noutside the\nabdomen\n, including\nlymph nodes\nin the\ngroin\n.\nExtragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors\nThe following stages are from the Children's Oncology Group.\nStage I\nIn stage I, the\ntumor\nis completely removed by\nsurgery\nand all of the following are true:\nno\ncancer\ncells\nare found in the area where the tumor was removed; and\nthe\ncapsule\n(outer covering of the tumor) did not rupture (break open) and a\nbiopsy\nwas not done before the tumor was removed; and\ncancer cells are not found in\nfluid\ntaken from the\nabdominal\ncavity\n, if the tumor is in the\nabdomen\n; and\nlymph nodes\nare smaller than 1\ncentimeter\non a\nCT scan\nor\nMRI\nof the abdomen,\npelvis\n, and chest.\nStage II\nIn stage II,\ncancer\nis not  completely removed by\nsurgery\nand one of the following is true:\ncancer that can only be seen with a\nmicroscope\nremains after surgery; or\nthe\ncapsule\n(outer covering of the\ntumor\n) ruptured (broke open) or a\nbiopsy\nwas done.\nCancer\ncells\nare not found in\nfluid\ntaken from the\nabdomen\n. There is no sign of cancer in\nlymph nodes\nin the abdomen,\npelvis\n, or chest on a\nCT scan\nor\nMRI\n.\nStage III\nIn stage III, one of the following is true:\ncancer\nis not completely removed by\nsurgery\nand cancer that can be seen with the eye remains after surgery or only a\nbiopsy\nwas done; or\nlymph nodes\nare at least 2\ncentimeters\nwide or  are larger than 1 centimeter but smaller than 2 centimeters in their shortest\ndiameter\nand either have not changed or are growing   when a\nCT scan\nor\nMRI\nis repeated within 4 to 6 weeks.\nStage IV\nIn stage IV, the\ncancer\nhas spread to other parts of the body, such as  the\nliver\n,\nlung\n, bone, or brain.\nChildhood extracranial germ cell tumors usually do not come back after treatment.\nRecurrent\nchildhood extracranial germ cell tumor is cancer that has come back after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the same place or in other parts of the body.\nThe number of patients who have tumors that come back is small.   Most recurrent\ngerm cell tumors\ncome back  within 3 years of surgery. About half of the\nteratomas\nthat\nrecur\nin the\nsacrum\nor\ncoccyx\nare\nmalignant\n, so\nfollow-up\nis important.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for  children with extracranial germ cell tumors.\nChildren with extracranial germ cell tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nThree types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nObservation\nChemotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nRadiation therapy\nTargeted therapy\nTreatment for childhood extracranial germ cell tumors may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for  children with extracranial germ cell tumors.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for  children with\nextracranial germ cell tumors\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.\nBecause cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nChildren with extracranial germ cell tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nTreatment will be overseen by a\npediatric oncologist\n, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other\nhealth care providers\nwho are experts in treating children with extracranial germ cell tumors and who specialize in certain areas of\nmedicine\n. These may include the following\nspecialists\n:\nPediatrician\n.\nPediatric surgeon\n.\nPediatric hematologist\n.\nRadiation\n\t\t\t oncologist\n.\nEndocrinologist\n.\nPediatric nurse specialist\n.\nRehabilitation specialist\n.\nChild life professional\n.\nPsychologist\n.\nSocial worker\n.\nGeneticist\n.\nFertility specialist\n.\nThree types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery\nto completely remove the\ntumor\nis done whenever possible. If the tumor is very large,\nchemotherapy\nmay be given first, to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of\ntissue\nthat needs to be removed during surgery. A goal of surgery is to keep\nreproductive\nfunction. The following types of surgery may be used:\nResection\n: Surgery to remove tissue or part or all of an\norgan\n.\nRadical\ninguinal orchiectomy\n: Surgery to remove one or both\ntesticles\nthrough an\nincision\n(cut) in the\ngroin\n.\nUnilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n: Surgery to remove one\novary\nand one\nfallopian tube\non the same side.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen \n         at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given \n         chemotherapy after surgery to kill any \n         cancer\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nObservation\nObservation is closely\nmonitoring\na patient’s\ncondition\nwithout giving any treatment until\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nappear or change. For childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, this includes\nphysical exams\n,\nimaging tests\n, and\ntumor marker tests\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer\ncells\n, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).  Systemic chemotherapy is used to treat extracranial germ cell tumors.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied.   Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nHigh doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including\nblood\n-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell transplant\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient or a\ndonor\nand are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. External radiation therapy is being studied for the treatment of childhood extracranial germ cell tumors that have come back.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of extracranial germ cell tumors that have come back.\nTreatment for childhood extracranial germ cell tumors may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSide effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called\nlate effects\n. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:\nPhysical problems,  such as\ninfertility\n, trouble hearing and\nkidney\nproblems.\nChanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.\nSecond cancers\n(new types of cancer), such as\nleukemia\nor malignant melanoma.\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. For more information, see\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\n.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nFor childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, follow-up may include regular physical exams, tumor marker tests, and imaging tests such as\nCT scan\n,\nMRI\nor\nchest x-ray\n.\nTreatment of Childhood Mature and Immature Teratomas\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of newly\ndiagnosed\nmature teratomas\nincludes the following:\nSurgery\nto remove the\ntumor\nfollowed by\nobservation\n.\nTreatment of newly diagnosed\nimmature teratomas\nincludes the following:\nSurgery to remove the tumor followed by observation for stage I tumors.\nSurgery to remove the tumor for stage I–IV tumors.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Imaging studies and blood tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood extracranial germ cell tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : A thorough examination of the body, including the testicles for lumps or swelling, is conducted in conjunction with a detailed patient health history. -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. Most malignant germ cell tumors release tumor markers. The following tumor markers are used to detect extracranial germ cell tumors:                - Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). - Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG). For testicular germ cell tumors, blood levels of the tumor markers help show if the tumor is a seminoma or nonseminoma. -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. In some cases, the tumor is removed during surgery and then a biopsy is done. The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:               -  Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. -  Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer, such as extracranial germ cell tumors and other forms of cancer."

        "question": "Who is at risk for Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors? ?",
        "right_answer": "Having certain genetic syndromes or other conditions can increase the risk of Wilms tumor.\n                    Anything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.    Wilms tumor may be part of a genetic syndrome that affects growth or development. A genetic syndrome is a set of signs and symptoms or conditions that occur together and is caused by certain changes in the genes. Certain conditions can also increase a child's risk of developing Wilms tumor. These and other genetic syndromes and conditions have been linked to Wilms tumor:         -  WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, aniridia, abnormal genitourinary system, and mental retardation).     -  Denys-Drash syndrome (abnormal genitourinary system).    - Frasier syndrome (abnormal genitourinary system).    -  Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (abnormally large growth of one side of the body or a body part, large tongue, umbilical hernia at birth, and abnormal genitourinary system).     - A family history of Wilms tumor.    - Aniridia (the iris, the colored part of the eye, is missing).    - Isolated hemihyperplasia (abnormally large growth of one side of the body or a body part).    -  Urinary tract problems such as cryptorchidism or hypospadias.\n                \n                \n                    Having certain conditions may increase the risk of renal cell cancer.\n                    Renal cell cancer may be related to the following conditions:         -  Von Hippel-Lindau disease (an inherited condition that causes abnormal growth of blood vessels). Children with Von Hippel-Lindau disease should be checked yearly for renal cell cancer with an ultrasound of the abdomen or an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) beginning at age 8 to 11 years.     -  Tuberous sclerosis (an inherited disease marked by noncancerous fatty cysts in the kidney).    -  Familial renal cell cancer (an inherited condition that occurs when certain changes in the genes that cause kidney cancer are passed down from the parent to the child).    - Renal medullary cancer (a rare kidney cancer that grows and spreads quickly).    -  Hereditary leiomyomatosis (an inherited disorder that increases the risk of having cancer of the kidney, skin, and uterus).        Prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for a childhood cancer, such as neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, leukemia, or Wilms tumor may also increase the risk of renal cell cancer.

        "context": "Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors\nKey Points\nChildhood kidney tumors are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the kidney.\nThere are many types of childhood kidney tumors.\nWilms Tumor\nRenal Cell Cancer (RCC)\nRhabdoid Tumor of the Kidney\nClear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney\nCongenital Mesoblastic Nephroma\nEwing Sarcoma of the Kidney\nPrimary Renal Myoepithelial Carcinoma\nCystic Partially Differentiated Nephroblastoma\nMultilocular Cystic Nephroma\nPrimary Renal Synovial Sarcoma\nAnaplastic Sarcoma of the Kidney\nNephroblastomatosis is not cancer but may become Wilms tumor.\nHaving certain genetic syndromes,  other conditions, or environmental exposures can  increase the risk of Wilms tumor.\nTests are used to screen for Wilms tumor.\nHaving certain conditions may increase the risk of renal cell cancer.\nTreatment for Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may include genetic counseling.\nSigns of Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors  include a lump in the abdomen and blood in the urine.\nTests that examine the kidney and the blood are used to diagnose Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nChildhood kidney tumors are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the kidney.\nThere are two\nkidneys\n, one on each side of the\nspine\n, above the waist. Tiny tubules in the kidneys\nfilter\nand clean the\nblood\n. They take out waste products and make\nurine\n. The urine passes from each kidney through a long tube called a\nureter\ninto the\nbladder\n. The bladder holds the urine until it passes through the\nurethra\nand leaves the body.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the urinary system showing the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The inside of the left kidney shows the renal pelvis. An inset shows the renal tubules and urine. Also shown is the spine and adrenal glands. Urine is made in the renal tubules and collects in the renal pelvis of each kidney. The urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters to the bladder. The urine is stored in the bladder until it leaves the body through the urethra.\nThere are many types of childhood kidney tumors.\nWilms Tumor\nIn\nWilms tumor\n, one or more\ntumors\nmay be found in one or both kidneys. Wilms tumor may spread to the\nlungs\n,\nliver\n, bone, brain, or nearby\nlymph nodes\n. In children and adolescents younger than 15 years old, most\nkidney cancers\nare Wilms tumors.\nRenal Cell Cancer (RCC)\nRenal cell cancer\nis rare in children  and adolescents younger than 15 years old. It is much more common in adolescents between 15 and 19 years old. Children and adolescents are more likely to be\ndiagnosed\nwith a large renal cell tumor or cancer that has  spread. Renal cell cancers may spread to the lungs, liver, bone, or lymph nodes. Renal cell cancer may also be called renal cell carcinoma.\nRhabdoid Tumor of the Kidney\nRhabdoid tumor of the kidney\nis a type of kidney cancer that occurs mostly in infants and young children. It is often\nadvanced\nat the time of diagnosis. Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney grows and spreads quickly, often  to the lungs or  brain.\nChildren with a certain change in the\nSMARCB1\ngene\ncan also have tumors grow in the kidney, brain, or\nsoft tissues\n. These children are checked regularly to see if a rhabdoid tumor has formed in the kidney or the brain:\nChildren from birth or\ndiagnosis\nto 5 years old have an\nMRI\nof the brain and\nspine\nand an\nultrasound of the abdomen\nevery 3 months.\nClear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney\nClear cell sarcoma of the kidney\nis an uncommon kidney  cancer that may  spread to the bone, lungs, brain, liver, or soft tissue.  It occurs most often before age 3 years.  It may\nrecur\n(come back) up to 14 years after treatment, often in the brain or lung.\nCongenital Mesoblastic Nephroma\nCongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nis a tumor of the kidney that is often diagnosed during the first year of life or before birth. It is the most common kidney tumor found in infants younger than 6 months old and is found more often in males than in females. It can usually be\ncured\n.\nEwing Sarcoma of the Kidney\nEwing sarcoma\n(previously called\nneuroepithelial\ntumor) of the kidney is rare and usually occurs in young adults. This cancer grows and spreads to other parts of the body quickly.\nPrimary Renal Myoepithelial Carcinoma\nPrimary renal myoepithelial carcinoma\nis a rare type of\ncancer\nthat usually affects soft tissues, but sometimes forms in the internal\norgans\n(such as the kidney).  This type of cancer grows and spreads quickly.\nCystic Partially Differentiated Nephroblastoma\nCystic\npartially\ndifferentiated\nnephroblastoma is a very rare type of Wilms tumor  made up     of cysts.\nMultilocular Cystic Nephroma\nMultilocular cystic nephromas are\nbenign\ntumors made up of cysts and are most common in infants, young children, and adult women. These tumors can occur in one or both kidneys.\nChildren with this type of tumor also may have\npleuropulmonary blastoma\n, so\nimaging tests\nthat check the lungs for cysts or\nsolid tumors\nare done. Since multilocular cystic nephroma may be an\ninherited\ncondition\n,\ngenetic counseling\nand\ngenetic testing\nmay be considered. See the PDQ summary about\nChildhood Pleuropulmonary Blastoma Treatment\nfor more information.\nPrimary Renal Synovial Sarcoma\nPrimary\nrenal synovial sarcoma is a cyst-like tumor of the kidney and is most common in young adults. These tumors grow and spread quickly.\nAnaplastic Sarcoma of the Kidney\nAnaplastic\nsarcoma\nof the kidney is a rare tumor that is most common in children or adolescents younger than 15 years of age. Anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney often spreads to the lungs, liver, or bones. Imaging tests that check the lungs for cysts or solid tumors may be done. Since anaplastic sarcoma may be  an inherited condition, genetic counseling and genetic testing may be considered.\nNephroblastomatosis is not cancer but may become Wilms tumor.\nSometimes, after the kidneys form in the\nfetus\n,\nabnormal\ngroups of   kidney cells remain in one or both kidneys.  In nephroblastomatosis (\ndiffuse hyperplastic perilobar nephroblastomatosis\n), these abnormal groups of cells may grow in many places inside the kidney  or make a thick layer around the  kidney.  When these groups of abnormal cells are found  in a kidney after it was removed for Wilms tumor, the child has an increased risk of Wilms tumor in the other kidney. Frequent\nfollow-up\ntesting is important at least every 3 months, for at least 7 years after the child is     diagnosed or treated.\nHaving certain genetic syndromes,  other conditions, or environmental exposures can  increase the risk of Wilms tumor.\nAnything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.\nWilms tumor may be part of a\ngenetic\nsyndrome\nthat affects  growth or development. A genetic syndrome is a set of\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nor conditions that occur together and is caused by certain changes in the genes. Certain conditions or\nenvironmental exposures\ncan also increase a child's risk of developing Wilms tumor. The following have been linked to Wilms tumor:\nWAGR syndrome\n(Wilms tumor,\naniridia\n, abnormal\ngenitourinary system\n, and mental disability).\nDenys-Drash syndrome\n(abnormal genitourinary system).\nFrasier syndrome (abnormal genitourinary system).\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome\n(abnormally large growth of one or more body parts, large tongue, umbilical\nhernia\nat birth, and abnormal genitourinary system).\nA\nfamily history\nof Wilms tumor.\nAniridia (part or all of the\niris\n, the colored part of the eye, is missing).\nIsolated\nhemihyperplasia\n(abnormally large growth of one or more body parts).\nUrinary tract\nproblems such as\ncryptorchidism\nor\nhypospadias\n.\nThe child's mother being exposed to\npesticides\nwhile she was\npregnant\n.\nTests are used to screen for Wilms tumor.\nScreening\ntests are done in children with an increased risk of Wilms tumor. These tests may help find cancer early and decrease the chance of dying from cancer.\nIn general, children with an increased risk of Wilms tumor  should be screened for Wilms tumor every 3 months until they are at least 8 years old. An ultrasound test of the abdomen is usually used for screening. Small Wilms tumors may be found and removed before symptoms occur.\nChildren with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or hemihyperplasia are also screened for liver and\nadrenal\ntumors that are linked to these genetic syndromes. A test to check the\nalpha-fetoprotein\n(AFP) level in the blood and an ultrasound of the abdomen are done until the child is 4 years old. An ultrasound of the kidneys is done between the ages of 4 and 7 years old. A\nphysical exam\nby a\nspecialist\n(\ngeneticist\nor\npediatric oncologist\n) is done two times each year. In children with certain gene changes, a different schedule for ultrasound of the abdomen may be used.\nChildren with aniridia and a certain gene change are screened for Wilms tumor every 3 months until they are 8 years old. An ultrasound test of the abdomen is used for screening.\nSome children develop Wilms tumor in both kidneys. These often appear   when Wilms tumor is first diagnosed, but Wilms tumor may also occur in the second kidney after the child is successfully  treated for Wilms tumor in one kidney. Children with an increased risk of a second Wilms tumor in the other kidney should be screened for Wilms tumor every 3 months for up to 8 years. An ultrasound test of the abdomen may be used for screening.\nHaving certain conditions may increase the risk of renal cell cancer.\nRenal cell cancer may be related to the following conditions:\nVon Hippel-Lindau disease\n(an\ninherited\ncondition that causes abnormal growth of\nblood vessels\n).  Children with Von Hippel-Lindau disease should be   checked yearly for renal cell cancer with an  ultrasound of the abdomen or an MRI      (magnetic resonance imaging)   beginning at age 8 to 11 years.\nTuberous sclerosis\n(an inherited disease marked by noncancerous fatty cysts in the kidney).\nFamilial\nrenal cell cancer (an inherited condition that occurs when certain changes in the genes that cause kidney cancer are passed down from the parent to the child).\nRenal medullary cancer (a  rare kidney cancer that grows and spreads quickly).\nHereditary leiomyomatosis\n(an inherited\ndisorder\nthat increases the risk of having cancer of the kidney, skin, and\nuterus\n).\nPrior\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nfor a\nchildhood cancer\n, such as\nneuroblastoma\n, soft tissue sarcoma,\nleukemia\n, or Wilms tumor may also increase the risk of renal cell cancer.  See the\nSecond Cancers\nsection in the PDQ summary about\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\nfor more information.\nTreatment for Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may include genetic counseling.\nGenetic counseling\n(a discussion with a trained professional about genetic diseases and whether\ngenetic testing\nis needed) may be done if the child has one of the following syndromes or conditions:\nA\ngenetic syndrome or condition that increases the risk of Wilms tumor\n.\nAn\ninherited condition that increases the risk of renal cell cancer\n.\nRhabdoid tumor\nof the kidney.\nMultilocular cystic nephroma.\nAnaplastic sarcoma of the kidney.\nSigns of Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors  include a lump in the abdomen and blood in the urine.\nSometimes childhood kidney tumors do not cause signs and symptoms and the parent finds a\nmass\nin the abdomen by chance or the mass is found during a well-child health check-up. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by kidney tumors or by other conditions.  Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:\nA lump, swelling, or pain in the abdomen.\nBlood in the urine.\nHigh blood pressure\n(headache, feeling very tired, chest pain, or  trouble seeing or breathing).\nHypercalcemia\n(loss of\nappetite\n,\nnausea\nand\nvomiting\n, weakness, or feeling very tired).\nFever\nfor no known reason.\nLoss of appetite.\nWeight loss for no known reason.\nWilms tumor that has spread to the lungs or liver may cause the following signs and symptoms:\nCough.\nBlood in the\nsputum\n.\nTrouble breathing.\nPain in the abdomen.\nTests that examine the kidney and the blood are used to diagnose Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nComplete blood\n\t\t\t count\n(CBC)\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and\n\t\t\t checked for the following:\nThe number of\nred blood cells\n,\nwhite blood cells\n, and\nplatelets\n.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries\noxygen\n) in\n\t\t\t\t  the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood\n\t\t\t\t  cells.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. This test is done to check how well the liver and kidneys are working.\nRenal function test\n: A procedure in which blood or urine samples are checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood or urine by the kidneys. A higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign that the kidneys are not working as they should.\nUrinalysis\n: A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, blood, and\nbacteria\n.\nUltrasound exam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. An ultrasound of the abdomen is done to diagnose a kidney tumor.\nEnlarge\nAbdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound transducer connected to a computer is pressed against the skin of the abdomen. The transducer bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, and\npelvis\n, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nis\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nEnlarge\nComputed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.\nMRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the  abdomen. A substance called\ngadolinium\nis injected into  a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nEnlarge\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.\nX-ray\n: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body, such as the chest and abdomen.\nPET-CT scan\n: A procedure that combines the pictures from a\npositron emission tomography (PET) scan\nand a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself. A PET scan is a procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor cells in the body. A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nBiopsy\n: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. The decision of whether to do a biopsy is based on the following:\nThe size of the tumor.\nThe\nstage\nof the cancer. If  the  tumor appears to be\nresectable\nor\nstage I\nor\nstage II Wilms tumor\n, a biopsy is not done to avoid tumor cells being  spread during the procedure.\nWhether cancer is in one or both kidneys.\nWhether imaging tests clearly show the cancer.\nWhether the patient is in a\nclinical trial\n.\nA biopsy may be done before any treatment is given, after chemotherapy to shrink the tumor, or after surgery to remove the tumor.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options for Wilms tumor depend on the following:\nHow different the tumor cells are from normal kidney cells when looked at under a microscope.\nThe stage of the cancer.\nThe type of tumor.\nThe age of the child.\nWhether the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.\nWhether there are certain changes in\nchromosomes\nor genes.\nWhether the cancer  has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).\nThe prognosis for renal cell cancer depends on the following:\nThe stage of the cancer.\nWhether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.\nThe prognosis for rhabdoid tumor of the kidney depends on the following:\nThe age of the child at the time of diagnosis.\nThe stage of the cancer.\nWhether the cancer has spread to the brain or\nspinal cord\n.\nThe prognosis for clear cell sarcoma of the kidney depends on the following:\nThe age of the child at the time of diagnosis.\nThe stage of the cancer.\nStages of Wilms Tumor\nKey Points\nWilms tumors are  staged during surgery and with imaging tests.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nIn addition to the stages, Wilms tumors are described by their histology.\nThe following stages are used for both favorable      histology and anaplastic Wilms tumors:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nStage V (bilateral)\nSometimes Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors come back after treatment.\nWilms tumors are  staged during surgery and with imaging tests.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread outside of the\nkidney\nto other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. The results of the tests and procedures done to\ndiagnose\nand stage\nWilms tumor\nare used to help make decisions about treatment.\nThere is no staging for the other types of childhood kidney\ntumors\n. The treatment of these tumors depends on the tumor type.\nThe following tests may be done to see if cancer has spread to other places in the body:\nLymph node biopsy\n: The removal of all or part of a\nlymph node\nin the\nabdomen\n. A\npathologist\nviews the lymph node\ntissue\nunder a\nmicroscope\nto check for cancer\ncells\n. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy or lymph node dissection.\nLiver function test\n: A procedure in which a\nblood\nsample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the\nliver\n. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign  that the liver is not working as it should.\nX-ray\nof the chest and bones\n: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body, such as the chest.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen,\npelvis\n, chest, and brain, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nis\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the\norgans\nor\ntissues\nshow up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nPET-CT scan\n: A procedure that combines the pictures from a\npositron emission tomography (PET) scan\nand a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both\nscans\nare combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself. A PET scan is a procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor\ncells in the body. A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\nabdomen\n,\npelvis\n, and brain. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nBone scan\n: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing\ncells\n, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of\nradioactive\nmaterial is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a\nscanner\n.\nEnlarge\nBone scan.  A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the child's vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive material collects in the bones. As the child lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen.\nUltrasound\nexam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. An ultrasound of the major heart\nvessels\nis done to stage\nWilms tumor\n.\nCystoscopy\n: A procedure to look inside the\nbladder\nand\nurethra\nto check for\nabnormal\nareas.  A\ncystoscope\nis inserted through the urethra into the bladder.  A cystoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a\nlens\nfor viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  Wilms tumor spreads to the\nlung\n, the cancer cells in the lung are actually Wilms tumor cells. The disease is metastatic Wilms tumor, not lung cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nIn addition to the stages, Wilms tumors are described by their histology.\nThe\nhistology\n(how the cells look under a microscope) of the\ntumor\naffects the\nprognosis\nand     the treatment of Wilms tumor. The histology may be favorable or\nanaplastic\n(unfavorable). Tumors with a favorable histology have a better prognosis and\nrespond\nbetter to\nchemotherapy\nthan anaplastic tumors. Tumor cells that are anaplastic divide quickly and under a microscope do not look like the type of cells they came from. Anaplastic tumors are harder to treat with chemotherapy than other Wilms tumors at the same stage.\nThe following stages are used for both favorable      histology and anaplastic Wilms tumors:\nStage I\nIn\nstage I\n, the\ntumor\nwas completely removed by\nsurgery\nand all of the following are true:\nCancer\nwas found only in the\nkidney\nand did not spread to\nblood vessels\nin the renal\nsinus\n(the part of the kidney where it joins the\nureter\n) or to the\nlymph nodes\n.\nNo cancer\ncells\nwere found at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed.\nThe outer layer of the kidney did not break open.\nThe tumor did not break open.\nA\nbiopsy\nwas not done before the tumor was removed.\nStage II\nIn\nstage II\n, the\ntumor\nwas completely removed by\nsurgery\nand no\ncancer\ncells\nwere found at the edges of the area where the cancer was removed. Cancer has not spread to\nlymph nodes\n. Before the tumor was removed, one of the following was  true:\nCancer had spread  to the renal\nsinus\n(the part of the\nkidney\nwhere it joins the\nureter\n).\nCancer had spread to\nblood vessels\noutside the area of the kidney where\nurine\nis made, such as the renal sinus.\nStage III\nIn\nstage III\n,\ncancer\nremains in the\nabdomen\nafter\nsurgery\nand at least one of the  following is true:\nCancer has spread to\nlymph nodes\nin the abdomen or\npelvis\n(the part of the body between the hips).\nCancer has spread to or through the surface of the\nperitoneum\n(the\ntissue\nthat lines the\nabdominal\ncavity\nand covers most\norgans\nin the abdomen).\nA biopsy of the\ntumor\nwas done before it was removed.\nThe tumor broke open before or during surgery to remove it.\nThe tumor was removed in more than one piece.\nCancer\ncells\nare found at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed.\nThe entire tumor could not be removed because important organs or tissues in the body would be damaged.\nStage IV\nIn\nstage IV\n,\ncancer\nhas spread through the\nblood\nto\norgans\nsuch as the\nlungs\n,\nliver\n, bone, or brain, or to\nlymph nodes\noutside the\nabdomen\nand\npelvis\n.\nStage V (bilateral)\nIn\nstage V\n(\nbilateral\n) Wilms tumor,\ncancer\ncells\nare found in both\nkidneys\nwhen the cancer is first\ndiagnosed\n. The cancer in each kidney is staged separately as stage I, II, III, or IV.\nSometimes Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors come back after treatment.\nChildhood Wilms tumor may\nrecur\n(come back) in the lungs, abdomen, liver, or other places in the body.\nChildhood\nclear cell sarcoma of the kidney\nmay recur in the brain, lungs, or other places in the body.\nChildhood\ncongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nmay recur in the kidneys or in other places in the body.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.\nChildren with Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors  should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nSix types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue\nTargeted therapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for children with\nWilms\nand other childhood\nkidney\ntumors\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.\nBecause cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.     Some clinical trials  are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nChildren with Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors  should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nYour child's treatment will be overseen by a\npediatric oncologist\n, a doctor who\nspecializes\nin treating children with cancer.  The pediatric oncologist works with other\npediatric\nhealth care providers\nwho are experts in treating  children with Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors  and who specialize in certain areas of\nmedicine\n.  These may include the following specialists:\nPediatrician\n.\nPediatric surgeon\nor\nurologist\n.\nRadiation oncologist\n.\nRehabilitation specialist\n.\nPediatric nurse  specialist\n.\nSocial worker\n.\nSix types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nTwo types of\nsurgery\nare used to treat kidney tumors:\nNephrectomy\n: Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors are usually treated with nephrectomy (surgery to remove the whole kidney). Nearby\nlymph nodes\nmay also be removed and checked for\nsigns\nof cancer. Sometimes a kidney\ntransplant\n(surgery to remove the kidney and replace it with a kidney from a\ndonor\n) is done when the cancer is in both kidneys and the kidneys are not working well.\nPartial nephrectomy\n: If cancer is found in both kidneys or is likely to spread to both kidneys, surgery  may include a partial nephrectomy (removal of the cancer in the kidney and a small amount of normal\ntissue\naround it). Partial nephrectomy is done to  keep as much of the kidney working as possible. A partial nephrectomy is also called renal-sparing surgery.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or\nradiation therapy\nafter surgery to kill any cancer\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given after the surgery,      to lower the risk that the cancer  will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n. Sometimes, a\nsecond-look surgery\nis done to see if cancer remains after chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\nSometimes the tumor cannot be removed by surgery for one of the following reasons:\nThe tumor is too close to important\norgans\nor\nblood vessels\n.\nThe tumor is too large to remove.\nThe cancer is in both kidneys, unless the tumors are very small.\nThere is a\nblood clot\nin the vessels near the\nliver\n.\nThe patient has trouble breathing because cancer has spread to the\nlungs\n.\nIn this case, a\nbiopsy\nis done first. Then chemotherapy is given to reduce the size of the tumor before surgery, in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible and lessen problems after surgery. This is called\nneoadjuvant\nchemotherapy. Radiation therapy is given after surgery.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nExternal radiation therapy is used to treat Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nCombination chemotherapy\nis treatment using two or more anticancer drugs.\nSystemic chemotherapy is used to treat Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.\nSometimes chemotherapy is given to reduce the size of the tumor before surgery, in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible and lessen problems after surgery. This is called\nneoadjuvant\nchemotherapy.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Cancers\nfor more information.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient's\nimmune system\nto fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.  This cancer treatment is a type of\nbiologic therapy\n.\nInterferon\nand\ninterleukin-2\n(IL-2) are types of immunotherapy used to treat childhood\nrenal cell cancer\n. Interferon may slow tumor growth and may help kill the cancer cells. IL-2 boosts the growth and activity of many immune cells, especially\nlymphocytes\n(a type of\nwhite blood cell\n). Lymphocytes can attack and kill cancer cells.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue\nHigh doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including\nblood\n-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell rescue\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue may be used to treat\nrhabdoid tumor\nof the kidney or\nrecurrent\nWilms tumor.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.  Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Targeted therapy used to treat childhood kidney tumors may include the following:\nTyrosine kinase inhibitors\n: This targeted therapy blocks signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide.\nLarotrectinib\nand\nentrectinib\nmay be used to treat\ncongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nwith a certain\ngene\nchange that cannot be removed by surgery, has spread to other parts of the body, or has continued to grow during treatment. This combination is also being studied to treat congenital mesoblastic nephroma that has come back after treatment.\nSunitinib\nor\ncabozantinib\nmay be used to treat renal cell carcinoma.\nAxitinib\nis being studied in combination with a monoclonal antibody (\nnivolumab\n) to treat renal cell carcinoma that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body.\nHistone methyltransferase inhibitors\n: This targeted therapy may keep the cancer cells from growing and dividing.\nTazemetostat\nis being studied to treat\nrhabdoid tumor of the kidney\nthat does not respond or has come back after treatment.\nMonoclonal antibody\ntherapy\n: Monoclonal antibodies are\nimmune system\nproteins\nmade in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these\nantibodies\ncan attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by\ninfusion\n. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or\nradioactive\nmaterial directly to cancer cells.\nNivolumab\nor a combination of nivolumab and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (axitinib) are being studied to treat renal cell carcinoma that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nOther targeted therapies are being studied for the treatment of childhood kidney tumors that have\nrecurred\n(come back).\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nInformation about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSide effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called\nlate effects\n. Late effects of cancer  treatment may include the following:\nPhysical problems, such as problems with the heart, the kidney, or during\npregnancy\n.\nInfertility\n.\nChanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.\nSecond cancers\n(new types of cancer), such as\nleukemias\n, cancer of the\ngastrointestinal tract\n, or\nbreast cancer\n.\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the\nPDQ\nsummary about\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\nfor more information).\nClinical trials are being done to find out if lower\ndoses\nof\nchemotherapy\nand\nradiation\ncan be used to lessen the late effects of treatment without changing how well the treatment works.\nMonitoring\nfor\nlate effects\ninvolving the kidneys in  patients with Wilms tumor and related  conditions includes the following:\nChildren with\nWAGR syndrome\nare monitored throughout their lives because they are at increased risk of\ndeveloping\nhypertension\nand kidney disease.\nChildren with Wilms tumor and\nabnormal\ngenitourinary system\nare monitored  because they are  at increased risk of late kidney failure.\nPatients with\nWilms tumor and\naniridia\nwithout abnormal genitourinary system are at lower\nrisk but are monitored for  kidney disease or\nkidney failure\n.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment Options for Wilms Tumor\nIn This Section\nStage I Wilms Tumor\nStage II Wilms Tumor\nStage III Wilms Tumor\nStage IV Wilms Tumor\nStage V Wilms Tumor and patients at high risk of developing bilateral Wilms tumor\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nStage I Wilms Tumor\nTreatment of\nstage I Wilms tumor\nwith favorable\nhistology\nmay include:\nNephrectomy\nwith removal of\nlymph nodes\n, followed by\ncombination chemotherapy\n.\nNephrectomy with removal of lymph nodes.\nTreatment of stage I\nanaplastic\nWilms tumor may include:\nNephrectomy with   removal of lymph nodes, followed by combination chemotherapy   and\nradiation therapy\nto the flank area (either side of the body between the ribs and hipbone).\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

A second\nsurgery\nis done to remove as much of the\ncancer\nas possible. This may be followed by more chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy if cancer remains after surgery.\nIf a kidney\ntransplant\nis needed because of kidney problems, it is usually delayed until 1 to 2 years after treatment is completed and there are no\nsigns\nof cancer.\n(See the\nTreatment of Recurrent Childhood Kidney Tumors\nsection of this summary for information about\nrecurrent\ndisease.)\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Having certain genetic syndromes or other conditions can increase the risk of Korsakoff syndrome. Anything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk. \nKorsakoff syndrome may be part of a genetic syndrome that affects growth or development. A genetic syndrome is a set of signs and symptoms or conditions that occur together and is caused by certain changes in the genes. Certain conditions can also increase a child's risk of developing Korsakoff syndrome. These and other genetic syndromes and conditions have been linked to Korsakoff syndrome:\n- WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, aniridia, abnormal genitourinary system, and mental retardation).\n- Denys-Drash syndrome (abnormal genitourinary system).\n- Frasier syndrome (abnormal genitourinary system).\n- Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (abnormally large growth of one side of the body or a body part, large tongue, umbilical hernia at birth, and abnormal genitourinary system).\n- A family history of Korsakoff syndrome.\n- Aniridia (the iris, the colored part of the eye, is missing).\n- Isolated hemihyperplasia (abnormally large growth of one side of the body or a body part).\n- Urinary tract problems such as cryptorchidism or hypospadias.\nHaving certain conditions may increase the risk of renal cell cancer. Renal cell cancer may be related to the following conditions:\n- Von Hippel-Lindau disease (an inherited condition that causes abnormal growth of blood vessels). Children with Von Hippel-Lindau disease should be checked yearly for renal cell cancer with an ultrasound of the abdomen or an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) beginning at age 8 to 11 years.\n- Tuberous sclerosis (an inherited disease marked by noncancerous fatty cysts in the kidney).\n- Familial renal cell cancer (an inherited condition that occurs when certain changes in the genes that cause kidney cancer are passed down from the parent to the child).\n- Renal medullary cancer (a rare kidney cancer that grows and spreads quickly).\n- Hereditary leiomyomatosis (an inherited disorder that increases the risk of having cancer of the kidney, skin, and uterus).\nPrior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for a childhood cancer, such as neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, leukemia, or Wilms tumor may also increase the risk of renal cell cancer. See the Second Cancers section in the PDQ summary about Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information."

        "question": "How to diagnose Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?",
        "right_answer": "Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to diagnose adult brain and spinal cord tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.     -  Visual field exam: An exam to check a persons field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen). This test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead). Any loss of vision may be a sign of a tumor that has damaged or pressed on the parts of the brain that affect eyesight.     -   Tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood, urine, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances made by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. These are called tumor markers. This test may be done to diagnose a germ cell tumor.    -   Gene testing : A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for changes in a chromosome that has been linked with a certain type of brain tumor. This test may be done to diagnose an inherited syndrome.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). MRI is often used to diagnose tumors in the spinal cord. Sometimes a procedure called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is done during the MRI scan. An MRS is used to diagnose tumors, based on their chemical make-up.     -   SPECT scan (single photon emission computed tomography scan): A procedure that uses a special camera linked to a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the brain. A very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein or inhaled through the nose. As the substance travels through the blood, the camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain. Blood flow and metabolism are higher than normal in areas where cancer cells are growing. These areas will show up brighter in the picture. This procedure may be done just before or after a CT scan. SPECT is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. PET is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body.\n                    A biopsy is also used to diagnose a brain tumor. If imaging tests show there may be a brain tumor, a biopsy is usually done. One of the following types of biopsies may be used:          -   Stereotactic biopsy : When imaging tests show there may be a tumor deep in the brain in a hard to reach place, a stereotactic brain biopsy may be done. This kind of biopsy uses a computer and a 3-dimensional (3-D) scanning device to find the tumor and guide the needle used to remove the tissue. A small incision is made in the scalp and a small hole is drilled through the skull. A biopsy needle is inserted through the hole to remove cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.    -   Open biopsy : When imaging tests show that there may be a tumor that can be removed by surgery, an open biopsy may be done. A part of the skull is removed in an operation called a craniotomy. A sample of brain tissue is removed and viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. If cancer cells are found, some or all of the tumor may be removed during the same surgery. Tests are done before surgery to find the areas around the tumor that are important for normal brain function. There are also ways to test brain function during surgery. The doctor will use the results of these tests to remove as much of the tumor as possible with the least damage to normal tissue in the brain.         The pathologist checks the biopsy sample to find out the type and grade of brain tumor. The grade of the tumor is based on how the tumor cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.    The following tests may be done on the tumor tissue that is removed:         -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.    -   Light and electron microscopy : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.     -   Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.           Sometimes a biopsy or surgery cannot be done.    For some tumors, a biopsy or surgery cannot be done safely because of where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord. These tumors are diagnosed and treated based on the results of imaging tests and other procedures.    Sometimes the results of imaging tests and other procedures show that the tumor is very likely to be benign and a biopsy is not done.",

The tumors are formed by the abnormal growth of cells and may begin in different parts of the brain or spinal cord. Together, the brain and spinal cord make up the\ncentral nervous system\n(CNS).\nThe tumors may be either\nbenign\n(not\ncancer\n) or\nmalignant\n(cancer):\nBenign brain and spinal cord tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain. They rarely spread into other tissues and may recur (come back).\nMalignant brain and spinal cord tumors are likely\n\t\t  to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue.\nWhen a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. Both benign and malignant brain tumors cause\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nand need treatment.\nBrain  and spinal cord tumors can occur in both  adults and children. However, treatment for\n\t\t  children may be different than treatment for adults.\nFor information about\nlymphoma\nthat begins in the brain, see\nPrimary CNS Lymphoma Treatment\n.\nA tumor that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the brain is called a metastatic brain tumor.\nTumors that start in the brain are called\nprimary\nbrain tumors.\nPrimary brain tumors may spread to other parts of the brain or to the\nspine\n. They rarely spread to other parts of the body.\nOften, tumors found in the brain have started somewhere else in the body and spread to one or more parts of the brain. These are called\nmetastatic\nbrain tumors (or brain metastases). Metastatic\n\t\t  brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors.  Up to half of metastatic brain tumors are from\nlung cancer\n.\nCancer may spread to the\nleptomeninges\n(the two innermost\nmembranes\ncovering the brain and spinal cord). This is called\nleptomeningeal carcinomatosis\n.\nThe brain controls many important body functions.\nThe brain has three major parts:\nThe\ncerebrum\nis the largest part of the brain. It is at the top of the head. The cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem solving, emotions, speech, reading, writing, and voluntary movement.\nThe\ncerebellum\nis in the lower back of the brain (near the middle of the back of the head). It controls movement, balance, and posture.\nThe\nbrain stem\nconnects the brain to the spinal cord. It is in the lowest part of the brain (just above the back of the neck). The brain stem controls breathing,\nheart rate\n, and the\nnerves\nand muscles used to see, hear, walk, talk, and eat.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the brain showing the cerebrum, ventricles (with cerebrospinal fluid shown in blue), cerebellum, brain stem (pons and medulla), and other parts of the brain.\nThe spinal cord connects the brain to nerves in most parts of the body.\nThe spinal cord is a column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back. It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes. These membranes are surrounded by the\nvertebrae\n(back bones). Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body, such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch.\nThere are different types of brain and spinal cord tumors.\nBrain and spinal cord tumors are named based on the type of cell they formed in and where the tumor first formed in the CNS. The\ngrade\nof a  tumor may be used to tell the difference between slow-growing and fast-growing types of the tumor. The\nWorld Health Organization\n(WHO) tumor grades are based on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.\nWHO Tumor Grading System\nGrade I (\nlow-grade\n) — The tumor cells look more like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread more slowly than grade II, III, and IV tumor cells. They rarely spread into nearby tissues. Grade I brain tumors may be completely removed by surgery.\nGrade II — The tumor cells grow and spread more slowly than grade III and IV tumor cells. They may spread into nearby tissue and may recur (come back). Some tumors may become a higher-grade tumor.\nGrade III — The tumor cells look very different from normal cells under a microscope and grow more quickly than grade I and II tumor cells. They are likely to spread into nearby tissue.\nGrade IV (\nhigh-grade\n) — The tumor cells do not look like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread very quickly. There may be areas of dead cells in the tumor. Grade IV tumors usually cannot be completely removed by surgery.\nThe following types of primary tumors can form in the brain or spinal cord:\nAstrocytic Tumors\nAn\nastrocytic tumor\nbegins in star-shaped brain cells called\nastrocytes\n, which help keep\nnerve cells\nhealthy. An astrocyte is a type of\nglial cell\n. Glial cells sometimes form tumors called\ngliomas\n. Astrocytic tumors include the following:\nBrain stem glioma (usually high grade)\n: A\nbrain stem glioma\nforms in the  brain stem, which is the part of the brain connected to the spinal cord. It is often a high-grade tumor, which spreads widely through the brain\n\t\t\t stem. Brain stem gliomas are rare in adults.\nPineal astrocytic tumor (any grade)\n: A pineal astrocytic tumor\n\t\t\t forms in tissue around the\npineal gland\nand  may be any grade. The pineal gland is a tiny organ in the brain that makes\nmelatonin\n, a\nhormone\nthat helps control the sleeping and waking cycle.\nPilocytic astrocytoma (grade I)\n: A\npilocytic\nastrocytoma\ngrows slowly in the brain or spinal cord. It may be in the form of a\ncyst\nand\n\t\t\t\trarely spreads into nearby tissues.\nDiffuse astrocytoma (grade II)\n: A\ndiffuse\nastrocytoma grows slowly, but often spreads into nearby  tissues. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. It is also called a low-grade diffuse astrocytoma.\nAnaplastic astrocytoma (grade III)\n: An\nanaplastic\nastrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby  tissues. The tumor cells look\n\t\t\t\tdifferent from normal cells. An anaplastic astrocytoma is also called a malignant astrocytoma or high-grade astrocytoma.\nGlioblastoma (grade IV)\n: A\nglioblastoma\ngrows and spreads very quickly. The tumor cells look very different from normal cells. It is\n\t\t\t\talso called glioblastoma multiforme.\nOligodendroglial Tumors\nAn\noligodendroglial tumor\nbegins in brain cells called\noligodendrocytes\n, which help keep nerve cells healthy.  An oligodendrocyte is a type of glial cell. Oligodendrocytes sometimes form tumors called oligodendrogliomas. Grades of oligodendroglial tumors include the following:\nOligodendroglioma (grade II)\n: An\noligodendroglioma\ngrows slowly, but often spreads into nearby  tissues. The tumor cells look something like normal cells.\nAnaplastic oligodendroglioma (grade III)\n: An anaplastic oligodendroglioma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells.\nMixed Gliomas\nA\nmixed glioma\nis a brain tumor that has  two types of tumor cells in it — oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. This type of mixed tumor is called an\noligoastrocytoma\n.\nOligoastrocytoma (grade II)\n: An oligoastrocytoma is a slow-growing tumor. The tumor cells look something like normal cells.\nAnaplastic oligoastrocytoma (grade III)\n: An anaplastic oligoastrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look\n\t\t\t\t different from normal cells. This type of tumor has a worse\nprognosis\nthan oligoastrocytoma (grade II).\nEpendymal Tumors\nAn\nependymal tumor\nusually begins in cells that line the\n\t\t\t fluid-filled spaces in the brain and\n\t\t\t around the spinal cord. An ependymal tumor may also be called an ependymoma. Grades of ependymomas include the following:\nEpendymoma (grade I or II)\n: A grade I or II\nependymoma\ngrows slowly and has cells\n\t\t\t\tthat look something like normal cells. There are two types of  grade I ependymoma —  myxopapillary ependymoma and subependymoma. A grade II ependymoma grows in a\nventricle\n(fluid-filled space in the brain) and its connecting paths or in the spinal cord.\nAnaplastic ependymoma (grade III)\n: An anaplastic ependymoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually has a worse prognosis than a grade I or II ependymoma.\nMedulloblastomas\nA\nmedulloblastoma\nis a type of\nembryonal tumor\n. Medulloblastomas are most common in children or young adults.\nFor more information about medulloblastomas in children, see\nChildhood Medulloblastoma and Other Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors Treatment\n.\nPineal Parenchymal Tumors\nA pineal\nparenchymal\ntumor forms in parenchymal cells or pineocytes,  which are the cells that make up most of  the pineal gland. These tumors are different  from pineal astrocytic tumors. Grades of pineal parenchymal\n\t\t\t tumors include the following:\nPineocytoma (grade II)\n: A\npineocytoma\nis a slow-growing pineal tumor.\nPineoblastoma (grade IV)\n: A\npineoblastoma\nis a rare tumor that is very likely to spread.\nFor more information about pineal parenchymal tumors in  children, see\nChildhood Medulloblastoma and Other Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors Treatment\n.\nMeningeal Tumors\nA\nmeningeal\ntumor, also called a meningioma, forms in the\nmeninges\n(thin layers of tissue that cover the\n\t\t\t brain and spinal cord). It can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells. Meningiomas are most common in adults. Types of meningeal tumors include the following:\nMeningioma (grade I)\n: A grade I meningioma is the most common type of meningeal tumor. A grade I meningioma is a slow-growing tumor. It forms most often in the\ndura mater\n. A grade I meningioma  may be completely removed by surgery.\nMeningioma (grade II and III)\n: This is a rare meningeal tumor.  It grows quickly\n\t\t\t\tand is likely\n\t\t\t\tto spread within the brain and spinal cord. The prognosis is worse than a grade I meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery.\nA\nhemangiopericytoma\nis not a meningeal tumor but is treated like a grade II or III meningioma. A hemangiopericytoma usually forms in the dura mater.  The prognosis is worse than a grade I meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery.\nGerm Cell Tumors\nA\ngerm cell tumor\nforms in germ cells, which are the cells that develop into\nsperm\nin men or ova (eggs) in women. There are different types of germ cell tumors. These include\ngerminomas\n,\nteratomas\n, embryonal yolk sac\ncarcinomas\n, and\nchoriocarcinomas\n. Germ cell tumors can be either benign or malignant.\nFor more information about childhood germ cell tumors in the brain, see\nChildhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors Treatment\n.\nCraniopharyngioma (Grade I)\nA\ncraniopharyngioma\nis a rare tumor that usually forms in the center of the brain just above the\npituitary gland\n(a pea-sized organ at the bottom of the brain that controls other\nglands\n).  Craniopharyngiomas can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells.\nFor more information about craniopharyngioma in children, see\nChildhood Craniopharyngioma Treatment\n.\nHaving certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk of a CNS tumor.\nAnything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop a brain or spinal cord tumor, and they can develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. There are few known risk factors for brain tumors. The following conditions may increase the risk of  certain types of brain tumors:\nBeing exposed to\nvinyl chloride\nmay increase the risk of   glioma.\nInfection\nwith the\nEpstein-Barr virus\n, having\nAIDS\n, or receiving an organ\ntransplant\nmay increase the risk of\nprimary CNS lymphoma\n. For more information, see\nPrimary CNS Lymphoma Treatment\n.\nHaving certain\ngenetic\nsyndromes\nmay increase the risk brain tumors:\nNeurofibromatosis type 1\n(NF1) or\n2\n(NF2).\nvon Hippel-Lindau disease\n.\nTuberous sclerosis\n.\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome\n.\nTurcot syndrome type 1 or 2.\nNevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome\n.\nThe cause of most adult brain and spinal cord tumors is not known.\nThe signs and symptoms  of adult brain and spinal cord tumors are not the same in every person.\nSigns and symptoms depend on the following:\nWhere the tumor forms in the brain or spinal cord.\nWhat the affected part of the brain controls.\nThe size of the tumor.\nThese and other signs and symptoms may be caused by CNS tumors or by other conditions, including cancer that has spread to the brain. Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nBrain Tumor Symptoms\nMorning headache or headache that goes away after\nvomiting\n.\nSeizures\n.\nVision, hearing, and speech problems.\nLoss of\nappetite\n.\nFrequent\nnausea\nand vomiting.\nChanges in personality, mood, ability to focus, or behavior.\nLoss of balance and trouble walking.\nWeakness.\nUnusual sleepiness or change in activity level.\nSpinal Cord Tumor Symptoms\nBack pain or pain that spreads from the back towards the arms or legs.\nA change in\nbowel\nhabits or trouble\nurinating\n.\nWeakness or numbness in the arms or legs.\nTrouble walking.\nTests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to \n\t\t  diagnose adult brain and spinal cord tumors.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nNeurological exam\n: A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a person's mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles,\nsenses\n, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.\nVisual field exam\n: An exam to check a person's field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen). This test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead). Any loss of vision may be a sign of a tumor that has damaged or pressed on the parts of the brain that affect eyesight.\nTumor marker test\n: A procedure in which a sample of\nblood\n,\nurine\n, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances made by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. These are called\ntumor markers\n. This test may be done to\ndiagnose\na germ cell tumor.\nGene testing\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which cells or tissue are analyzed to look for changes in\ngenes\nor\nchromosomes\n. These changes may be a sign that a person has or is at risk of having a specific disease or condition.\nCT scan\n(CAT\n\t\t\t scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nEnlarge\nComputed tomography (CT) scan of the brain. The patient lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes x-ray pictures of the brain.\nMRI\n(magnetic\n\t\t\t resonance imaging) with\ngadolinium\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord.  A substance called gadolinium is injected into  a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). MRI is often used to diagnose tumors in the spinal cord. Sometimes a procedure called\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy\n(MRS) is done during the  MRI\nscan\n. An MRS is used to diagnose tumors, based on their chemical make-up.\nSPECT\nscan (single photon emission computed tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the brain. A small amount of a\nradioactive\nsubstance is injected into a vein or\ninhaled\nthrough the nose. As the substance travels through the blood, a camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain. A computer uses the pictures to make a\n3-dimensional\n(3-D) image of the brain. There will be increased blood flow and more activity in areas where cancer cells are growing. These areas will show up brighter in the picture.\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. PET is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body.\nEnlarge\nPET (positron emission tomography) scan. The patient lies on a table that slides through the PET machine.  The head rest and white strap help the patient lie still.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the patient's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body.  Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nA biopsy is also used to diagnose a brain tumor.\nIf\nimaging tests\nshow there may be a brain tumor, a\nbiopsy\nis usually done. One of the following types of biopsies may be used:\nStereotactic biopsy\n: When imaging tests show there may be a tumor deep in the brain in a hard to reach place, a stereotactic brain biopsy may be done. This kind of  biopsy uses a computer and a 3-dimensional (3-D) scanning device to find the tumor and guide the needle used to remove the  tissue. A small\nincision\nis made in the scalp, and a small hole is drilled through the\nskull\n. A biopsy needle is inserted through the hole to remove cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer.\nOpen biopsy\n: When imaging tests show that there may be a tumor  that can be removed  by surgery, an open biopsy may be done. A part of the skull is removed in an operation called a\ncraniotomy\n. A sample of brain tissue is removed and viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. If cancer cells are found, some or all of the  tumor may be removed during the same surgery.  Tests are done before surgery to find the areas around the tumor that are important for normal brain function. There are also ways to test brain function during surgery. The doctor will use the results of these tests to remove as much of the tumor as possible with the least damage to normal tissue in the brain.\nEnlarge\nCraniotomy:  An opening is made in the skull and a piece of the skull is removed to show part of the brain.\nThe pathologist checks the biopsy sample to find out the type and\ngrade\nof the brain tumor. The grade of the tumor is based on how the tumor cells look under a microscope, and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.\nThe following tests may be done on the tumor tissue that is removed:\nImmunohistochemistry\n: A laboratory test that uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient's tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nLight\nand\nelectron microscopy\n: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.\nCytogenetic\nanalysis\n: A laboratory test in which the chromosomes of cells in a sample of brain tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nSometimes a biopsy or surgery cannot be done.\nFor some tumors, a biopsy or surgery cannot be done safely because of where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord. These tumors are diagnosed and treated based on the results of imaging tests and other procedures.\nSometimes the results of imaging tests and other procedures show that the tumor is very likely to be benign, and a biopsy is not done.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe prognosis and treatment options for\nprimary\nbrain and spinal cord tumors depend on the following:\nThe type and grade of the tumor.\nWhere the tumor is in the brain or spinal cord.\nWhether the tumor can be removed by surgery.\nWhether cancer cells remain after surgery.\nWhether there are certain changes in the chromosomes.\nWhether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).\nThe patient's general health.\nThe prognosis and treatment options for\nmetastatic\nbrain and spinal cord tumors depend on the following:\nWhether there are more than two tumors in the brain or spinal cord.\nWhere the tumor is in the brain or spinal cord.\nHow well the tumor responds to treatment.\nWhether the primary tumor continues to grow or spread.\nStages of Adult Central Nervous System Tumors\nKey Points\nThere is no standard staging system for adult brain and spinal cord tumors.\nImaging tests may be repeated after surgery to help plan more treatment.\nCentral nervous system (CNS) tumors often recur, sometimes many years\n\t\tafter treatment.\nThere is no standard staging system for adult brain and spinal cord tumors.\nThe process used to find out if cancer has spread to other areas of the\nbrain\nor to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n.\nBrain tumors\nthat begin in the brain rarely spread to other parts of the body. There is no standard\nstaging system\nfor brain and\nspinal cord\ntumors.\nTreatment of primary brain and spinal cord tumors is based on the following:\nThe type of cell in which the tumor began.\nWhere the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord.\nThe amount of cancer left after surgery.\nThe\ngrade\nof the tumor.\nTreatment of tumors that have spread to the brain from other parts of the body is based on the number of tumors in the brain.\nImaging tests may be repeated after surgery to help plan more treatment.\nSome of the\ntests and procedures\nused to\ndiagnose\na brain or spinal cord tumor may be repeated after treatment to find out how much tumor is left.\nCentral nervous system (CNS) tumors often recur, sometimes many years\n\t\tafter treatment.\nA recurrent\nCNS\ntumor is a  tumor that has recurred (come back)\n\t\tafter it has been treated. The tumor may recur at the same place as the first tumor or in other parts of the CNS.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with adult\n\t\t  brain and spinal cord tumors.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nActive surveillance\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nTargeted therapy\nSupportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nProton beam radiation therapy\nImmunotherapy\nTreatment for adult central nervous system tumors may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with adult\n\t\t  brain and spinal cord tumors.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with adult\nbrain\nand\nspinal cord\ntumors. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and\n\t\t  some are being tested in\nclinical\n\t\t  trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new\n\t\t  treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new\n\t\t  treatment is better than the standard\n\t\t  treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.\n\t\t  Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nActive surveillance\nActive surveillance\nis closely watching a patient’s condition but not giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results that show the condition is getting worse. Active surveillance may be used to avoid or delay the need for treatments such as\nradiation therapy\nor surgery, which can cause\nside effects\nor other problems. During active surveillance, certain exams and tests are done on a regular schedule. Active  surveillance may be used for very slow-growing tumors that do not cause\nsymptoms\n.\nSurgery\nSurgery may be used to diagnose and treat adult brain and spinal cord tumors. Removing tumor tissue helps decrease pressure of the tumor on nearby parts of the brain. See the\nGeneral Information\nsection of this summary.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time  of the surgery, some patients may be given\nchemotherapy\nor radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nEnlarge\nExternal-beam radiation therapy of the brain. A machine is used to aim high-energy radiation. The machine can rotate around the patient, delivering radiation from many different angles. A mesh mask helps keep the patient’s head from moving during treatment. Small ink marks are put on the mask. The ink marks are used to line up the radiation machine in the same position before each treatment.\nCertain ways of giving external radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:\nConformal radiation therapy\n:\n\n   Conformal radiation therapy uses a computer to make a\n3-dimensional\n(3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor.\nIntensity-modulated radiation therapy\n(IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor.  Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.\nStereotactic radiosurgery\n: Stereotactic radiosurgery uses a rigid head frame that is attached to the\nskull\nto keep the head still during the radiation treatment.  A machine aims a single large\ndose\nof radiation directly at the tumor. This procedure does not involve surgery.  It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery, radiosurgery, and radiation surgery.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).  Although most cannot, some chemotherapy drugs can cross the\nblood-brain barrier\nand reach tumor cells in the brain. Chemotherapy that is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\nis called\nintrathecal chemotherapy\n. When chemotherapy is inserted in an organ, such as the brain, or a body\ncavity\n, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n).\nTo treat  brain tumors, a\nwafer\nthat dissolves may be used to deliver a chemotherapy drug directly to the brain tumor site after the tumor has been removed by surgery. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and\ngrade\nof tumor and where it is in the brain.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Brain Tumors\nfor more information.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.\nMonoclonal antibody\ntherapy\n: Monoclonal antibodies are\nimmune system\nproteins\nmade in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these\nantibodies\ncan attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by\ninfusion\n. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or\nradioactive\nmaterial directly to cancer cells.\nBevacizumab\nis a monoclonal antibody that binds to  a protein called\nvascular endothelial growth factor\n(VEGF) and may prevent the growth of new\nblood vessels\nthat tumors need to grow. Bevacizumab is used in the treatment of\nrecurrent\nglioblastoma\n.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nOther types of targeted therapies are being studied for adult brain tumors, including\ntyrosine kinase inhibitors\nand new VEGF inhibitors.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Brain Tumors\nfor more information.\nSupportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment.\nThis therapy controls problems or\nside effects\ncaused by the disease or its treatment and improves\nquality of life\n. For brain tumors, supportive care includes drugs to control\nseizures\nand  fluid buildup or swelling in the brain.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section refers to new treatments being studied in clinical trials, but it may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nProton beam radiation therapy\nProton beam radiation therapy\nis a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells. This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy tissue near a tumor. It is used to treat cancers of the head, neck, and\nspine\nand organs such as the brain, eye,\nlung\n, and\nprostate\n. Proton beam radiation is different from x-ray radiation.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient's\nimmune system\nto fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.\nImmunotherapy is being studied for the treatment of some types of brain tumors. Treatments may include the following:\nDendritic cell vaccine\ntherapy.\nGene therapy\n.\nTreatment for adult central nervous system tumors may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nThe following tests and procedures may be used to check whether a brain tumor has come back after treatment:\nSPECT\nscan (single photon emission computed tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor cells in the brain. A small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein or\ninhaled\nthrough the nose. As the substance travels through the blood, a camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain. A computer uses the pictures to make a\n3-dimensional\n(3-D) image of the brain. There will be increased blood flow and more activity in areas where cancer cells are growing. These areas will show up brighter in the picture.\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nEnlarge\nPET (positron emission tomography) scan. The patient lies on a table that slides through the PET machine.  The head rest and white strap help the patient lie still.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the patient's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body.  Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nTreatment of Primary Adult Brain Tumor by Type of Tumor\nIn This Section\nAstrocytic Tumors\nBrain Stem Gliomas\nPineal Astrocytic Tumors\nPilocytic Astrocytomas\nDiffuse Astrocytomas\nAnaplastic Astrocytomas\nGlioblastomas\nOligodendroglial Tumors\nMixed Gliomas\nEpendymal Tumors\nMedulloblastomas\nPineal Parenchymal Tumors\nMeningeal Tumors\nGerm Cell Tumors\nCraniopharyngiomas\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nAstrocytic Tumors\nBrain Stem Gliomas\nTreatment of\nbrain stem gliomas\nmay include\nradiation therapy\n.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to diagnose adult brain and spinal cord tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam. -  Visual field exam: An exam to check a persons field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen). This test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead). Any loss of vision may be a sign of cancer spreading through the body.\n                    A biopsy is also used to diagnose a brain tumor. If imaging tests show there may be a brain tumor, a biopsy is usually done. One of the following types of biopsies may be used:          -   Stereotactic biopsy : When imaging tests show there may be a tumor deep in the brain in a hard to reach place, a stereotactic brain biopsy may be done. This kind of biopsy uses a computer and a 3-dimensional (3-D) scanning device to find the tumor and guide the needle used to remove the tissue. A small incision is made in the scalp and a small hole is drilled through the skull. A biopsy needle is inserted through the hole to remove cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. -   Open biopsy : When imaging tests show that there may be a tumor that can be removed by surgery, an open biopsy may be done. A part of the skull is removed in an operation called a craniotomy. A sample of brain tissue is removed and viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. If cancer cells are found, some or all of the tumor may be removed during the same surgery. Tests are done before surgery to find the areas around the tumor that are important for normal brain function. There are also ways to test brain function during surgery. The doctor will use the results of these tests to remove as much of the tumor as possible with the least damage to normal tissue in the brain. The pathologist checks the biopsy sample to find out the type and grade of brain tumor. The grade of the tumor is based on how the tumor cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread. The following tests may be done on the tumor tissue that is removed:         -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer. -   Light and electron microscopy : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells. -   Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. Sometimes a biopsy or surgery cannot be done. For some tumors, a biopsy or surgery cannot be done safely because of where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord. These tumors are diagnosed and treated based on the results of imaging tests and other procedures. Sometimes the results of imaging tests and other procedures show that the tumor is very likely to be benign and a biopsy is not done."

        "question": "How to diagnose Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma ?",
        "right_answer": "Tests that examine the thymus are used to detect (find) thymoma or thymic carcinoma. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -  Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\n                    Thymoma and thymic carcinoma are usually diagnosed, staged, and treated during surgery. A biopsy of the tumor is done to diagnose the disease. The biopsy may be done before or during surgery (a mediastinoscopy or mediastinotomy), using a thin needle to remove a sample of cells. This is called a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Sometimes a wide needle is used to remove a sample of cells and this is called a core biopsy. A pathologist will view the sample under a microscope to check for cancer. If thymoma or thymic carcinoma is diagnosed, the pathologist will determine the type of cancer cell in the tumor. There may be more than one type of cancer cell in a thymoma. The surgeon will decide if all or part of the tumor can be removed by surgery. In some cases, lymph nodes and other tissues may be removed as well.",
        "context": "Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nGeneral Information About   Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma\nKey Points\nThymoma and thymic carcinoma are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the thymus.\nThymoma is linked with myasthenia gravis and other autoimmune paraneoplastic diseases.\nSigns and symptoms of thymoma  and thymic carcinoma include a cough and chest pain.\nTests that examine the thymus are used to help diagnose and stage thymoma and thymic carcinoma.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThymoma and thymic carcinoma are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the thymus.\nThymoma\nand\nthymic carcinoma\n, also called thymic epithelial tumors (TETs), are two types of rare\ncancers\nthat can form in the\ncells\nthat cover the outside surface of the\nthymus\n. The thymus is a small\norgan\nthat lies in the upper chest above the heart and under the\nbreastbone\n. It is part of the\nlymph system\nand makes\nwhite blood cells\n, called\nlymphocytes\n, that help fight\ninfection\n. These cancers usually form between the\nlungs\nin the front part of the chest and are sometimes found during a\nchest x-ray\nthat is done for another reason.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the thymus gland. The thymus gland is a small organ that lies in the upper chest under the breastbone. It makes white blood cells, called lymphocytes, which protect the body against infections.\nEven though thymoma and thymic carcinoma form in the same type of cell, they act differently:\nThymoma. The cancer cells look a lot like the normal cells of the thymus, grow slowly, and rarely spread beyond the thymus.\nThymic carcinoma. The cancer cells do not look like the normal cells of the thymus, grow more quickly, and are more likely to spread to other parts of the body. About one in every five TETs is a thymic carcinoma. Thymic carcinoma is more difficult to treat than thymoma.\nOther types of tumors, such as\nlymphoma\nor\ngerm cell tumors\n, may form in the thymus, but they are not considered to be thymoma or thymic carcinoma.\nThymoma is linked with myasthenia gravis and other autoimmune paraneoplastic diseases.\nAutoimmune paraneoplastic diseases\nare often linked with thymoma. Autoimmune paraneoplastic  diseases may occur in patients with cancer but are not caused directly by cancer. Autoimmune paraneoplastic diseases are marked by\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nthat develop when the body's immune system attacks not only cancer cells but also normal cells.     Autoimmune paraneoplastic diseases linked with thymoma  include:\nMyasthenia gravis\n(the most common autoimmune paraneoplastic disease linked with thymoma).\nThymoma-associated\nhypogammaglobulinemia\n(Good syndrome).\nThymoma-associated autoimmune\npure red cell aplasia\n.\nOther autoimmune paraneoplastic diseases may  be linked with TETs and can involve any organ.\nSigns and symptoms of thymoma  and thymic carcinoma include a cough and chest pain.\nMost patients do not have\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nwhen first\ndiagnosed\nwith thymoma or thymic carcinoma.  Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nA cough that doesn't go away.\nShortness of  breath.\nChest pain.\nA hoarse voice.\nSwelling in the face, neck, upper body, or arms.\nTests that examine the thymus are used to help diagnose and stage thymoma and thymic carcinoma.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n:  An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nChest x-ray\n: An\nx-ray\nof the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or\ntissues\nshow up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor cells in the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n:  A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nBiopsy\n: The removal of cells or tissues using a needle so they can be viewed under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nWhether the cancer is thymoma or thymic carcinoma.\nWhether the cancer has spread to nearby areas or other parts of the body.\nWhether the tumor can be  removed completely by surgery.\nWhether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nStages of Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma\nKey Points\nAfter thymoma or thymic carcinoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for thymoma:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nThymic carcinomas have usually spread to other parts of the body when diagnosed.\nThymic carcinoma is more likely to recur than thymoma.\nAfter thymoma or thymic carcinoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if\nthymoma\nor\nthymic carcinoma\nhas spread from the\nthymus\nto nearby areas or other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. Thymoma and thymic carcinoma may spread to the\nlungs\n,\nchest wall\n, major vessels,\nesophagus\n, or the lining around the lungs and heart. The results of tests and procedures done to\ndiagnose\nthymoma or thymic carcinoma are used to help make decisions about treatment.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if\nthymic carcinoma\nspreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually thymic carcinoma cells. The disease is metastatic thymic carcinoma, not bone cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for thymoma:\nStage I\nIn\nstage I\n,\ncancer\nis found only within the\nthymus\n. All cancer\ncells\nare inside the\ncapsule\n(sac) that surrounds the thymus.\nStage II\nIn\nstage II\n,\ncancer\nhas spread through the\ncapsule\nand into the fat around the\nthymus\nor into the lining of the chest\ncavity\n.\nStage III\nIn\nstage III\n,\ncancer\nhas spread to nearby\norgans\nin the chest, including the\nlung\n, the sac around the heart, or large\nblood vessels\nthat carry\nblood\nto the heart.\nStage IV\nStage IV\nis divided into stage IVA and stage IVB, depending on where the\ncancer\nhas spread.\nIn\nstage IVA\n, cancer has spread widely around the\nlungs\nor heart.\nIn\nstage IVB\n, cancer has  spread to the\nblood\nor\nlymph system\n.\nThymic carcinomas have usually spread to other parts of the body when diagnosed.\nThe\nstaging system\nused for\nthymomas\nis sometimes used for thymic carcinomas.\nThymic carcinoma is more likely to recur than thymoma.\nRecurrent\nthymoma\nand\nthymic carcinoma\nare\ncancers\nthat have\nrecurred\n(come back) after treatment. The cancer may come back in the\nthymus\nor in other parts of the body. Thymic carcinoma is more likely to recur than thymoma.\nThymomas may recur  a long time after treatment is completed. There is also an increased risk of having another type of cancer after having a thymoma. For these reasons, lifelong\nfollow-up\nis needed.\nThymic carcinomas often recur.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with thymoma and thymic carcinoma.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nHormone therapy\nTargeted therapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nImmunotherapy\nTreatment for thymoma and thymic carcinoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with thymoma and thymic carcinoma.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for  patients with\nthymoma\nand\nthymic carcinoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery\nto remove the\ntumor\nis the most common treatment of thymoma.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given\nradiation therapy\nafter surgery to kill any cancer\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nChemotherapy may be used to shrink the tumor before  surgery or radiation therapy. This is called\nneoadjuvant\nchemotherapy.\nHormone therapy\nHormone therapy\nis a cancer treatment that removes\nhormones\nor blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by\nglands\nin the body and flow through the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (\nreceptors\n), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working. Hormone therapy using\noctreotide\nwith or without\nprednisone\nmay be used to treat thymoma or thymic carcinoma.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses\ndrugs\nor other substances  to identify and attack  specific cancer cells.\nTyrosine kinase inhibitors\n(TKIs) and\nmammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors\nare      types of targeted therapies used in the treatment of thymoma and thymic carcinoma.\nTKIs: This treatment blocks signals needed for tumors to grow.\nSunitinib\nand\nlenvatinib\nare  TKIs that may be used to treat\nrecurrent\nthymoma or recurrent thymic carcinoma.\nmTOR inhibitors: This treatment blocks a\nprotein\ncalled\nmTOR\n, which may keep cancer cells from growing and prevent the growth of new\nblood vessels\nthat tumors need to grow.\nEverolimus\nis an mTOR inhibitor that may be used to treat recurrent  thymoma or recurrent thymic carcinoma.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient’s\nimmune system\nto fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of\nbiologic therapy\n.\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor\ntherapy:\nPD-1\nis a protein on the surface of\nT cells\nthat helps keep the body’s\nimmune responses\nin check.\nPD-L1\nis a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other.  This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells.\nPembrolizumab\nis a type of PD-1 inhibitor that is being studied in the treatment of recurrent thymoma and thymic carcinoma.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nImmunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.\nTreatment for thymoma and thymic carcinoma may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Stage I and Stage II Thymoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nstage I\nand\nstage II thymoma\nis\nsurgery\n,  which may be  followed by\nradiation therapy\n.\nTreatment of Stage III and Stage IV Thymoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nstage III\nand\nstage IV thymoma\nthat may be completely removed by\nsurgery\nincludes the following:\nSurgery followed by\nradiation therapy\n.\nNeoadjuvant\nchemotherapy\nfollowed by surgery and radiation therapy.\nTreatment of stage III and stage IV thymoma that cannot be completely removed by surgery includes the following:\nChemotherapy.\nChemotherapy followed by radiation therapy.\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery (if\noperable\n)  and radiation therapy.\nTreatment of Thymic Carcinoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nthymic carcinoma\nthat may be completely removed by\nsurgery\nincludes the following:\nSurgery followed by\nradiation therapy\nwith or without\nchemotherapy\n.\nTreatment of thymic carcinoma that cannot be completely removed by surgery  includes the following:\nChemotherapy.\nChemotherapy with radiation therapy.\nChemotherapy followed surgery, if the tumor may be completely removed, and radiation therapy.\nTreatment of Recurrent Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nrecurrent\nthymoma\nand\nthymic carcinoma\nmay include the following:\nChemotherapy\n.\nHormone therapy\n(\noctreotide\n) with or without\nprednisone\n.\nTargeted  therapy\n.\nSurgery\n.\nRadiation therapy\n.\nA\nclinical trial\nof\nimmune checkpoint inhibitor\ntherapy\nwith\npembrolizumab\n.\n",

The lymph system is part of the\nimmune system\n. It helps protect the body from\ninfection\nand disease.\nThe lymph system is made up of the following:\nLymph\n: Colorless, watery\nfluid\nthat travels through the\nlymph vessels\nand carries\nlymphocytes\n(\nwhite blood cells\n). There are three types of lymphocytes:\nB lymphocytes\nthat make\nantibodies\nto help fight infection. Also called B cells. Most types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begin in B lymphocytes.\nT lymphocytes\nthat help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection. Also called T cells.\nNatural killer cells\nthat attack cancer\ncells\nand\nviruses\n. Also called NK cells.\nLymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.\nLymph nodes\n: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are found along a network of lymph vessels throughout the body. Groups of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm,\nmediastinum\n,\nabdomen\n,\npelvis\n, and\ngroin\n.\nSpleen\n: An\norgan\nthat makes lymphocytes, stores\nred blood cells\nand lymphocytes, filters the\nblood\n, and destroys old blood cells. The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the\nstomach\n.\nThymus\n: An organ in which T lymphocytes mature and multiply.

White blood cells, red blood cells, and\nplatelets\nare made in the bone marrow.\nEnlarge\nThe lymph system is part of the body's immune system and is made up of tissues and organs that help protect the body from infection and disease. These include the tonsils, adenoids (not shown), thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes. Lymph tissue is also found in many other parts of the body, including the small intestine.\nLymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the lining of the\ndigestive tract\n,\nbronchus\n, and skin.\nThere are two general types of\nlymphomas\n:\nHodgkin lymphoma\nand non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This summary is about the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults, including during\npregnancy\n.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma can be indolent or aggressive.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma grows and spreads at different rates and can be\nindolent\nor\naggressive\n. Indolent lymphoma tends to grow and spread slowly, and has few\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\n. Aggressive lymphoma grows and spreads quickly, and has signs and symptoms that can be severe. The treatments for indolent and aggressive lymphoma are different.\nThis summary is about the following types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma:\nIndolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas\nFollicular lymphoma\n.\nFollicular lymphoma is the most common type of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is a very slow-growing type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins in B lymphocytes. It  affects the lymph nodes and may spread to the bone marrow or spleen. Most patients with follicular lymphoma are age 50 years and older when they are\ndiagnosed\n. Follicular lymphoma may go away without treatment. The patient is closely watched for signs or symptoms that the disease has come back. Treatment is needed if signs or symptoms occur after the cancer disappeared or after initial cancer treatment. Sometimes follicular lymphoma can become a more aggressive type of lymphoma, such as\ndiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\n.\nLymphoplasmacytic lymphoma\n.\nIn most cases of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma,  B lymphocytes that are turning into\nplasma cells\nmake large amounts of a\nprotein\ncalled\nmonoclonal\nimmunoglobulin\nM (IgM) antibody. High levels of IgM antibody in the blood cause the blood\nplasma\nto thicken. This may cause signs or symptoms such as trouble seeing or hearing, heart problems, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, and numbness or tingling of the hands and feet. Sometimes there are no signs or symptoms of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. It may be found when a\nblood test\nis done for another reason. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma often spreads to the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen. Patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma should be checked for\nhepatitis C virus\ninfection. It is also called Waldenström macroglobulinemia.\nMarginal zone lymphoma\n.\nThis type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begins in B lymphocytes in a part of lymph tissue called the marginal zone. The\nprognosis\nmay be worse for patients aged 70 years or older, those with\nstage III\nor\nstage IV\ndisease, and those with  high\nlactate dehydrogenase\n(LDH) levels. There are five different types of marginal zone lymphoma. They are grouped by the type of tissue where the lymphoma formed:\nNodal marginal zone lymphoma.\nNodal marginal zone lymphoma forms in lymph nodes. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is rare. It is also called monocytoid\nB-cell lymphoma\n.\nGastric\nmucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma\n.\nGastric MALT lymphoma usually begins in the stomach. This type of marginal zone lymphoma  forms in cells in the\nmucosa\nthat help make antibodies. Patients with gastric MALT lymphoma may also have\nHelicobacter\ngastritis\nor an\nautoimmune disease\n, such as\nHashimoto thyroiditis\nor\nSjögren syndrome\n.\nExtragastric MALT lymphoma.\nExtragastric MALT lymphoma begins outside of the stomach in almost every part of the body including other parts of the\ngastrointestinal tract\n,\nsalivary glands\n,\nthyroid\n, lung, skin, and around the eye. This type of marginal zone lymphoma  forms in cells in the mucosa that help make antibodies. Extragastric MALT lymphoma may come back many years after treatment.\nMediterranean\nabdominal\nlymphoma.\nThis is a type of MALT lymphoma that occurs in young adults in eastern Mediterranean countries. It often forms in the abdomen and patients may also be infected with\nbacteria\ncalled\nCampylobacter jejuni\n. This type of lymphoma is also called immunoproliferative small intestinal disease.\nSplenic\nmarginal zone lymphoma.\nThis type of marginal zone lymphoma begins in the spleen and  may spread to the\nperipheral blood\nand bone marrow. The most common sign of this type of splenic marginal zone lymphoma is a spleen that is larger than normal.\nPrimary\ncutaneous\nanaplastic large cell lymphoma\n.\nThis type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is in the skin only. It can be a\nbenign\n(not cancer)\nnodule\nthat may go away on its own or it can spread to many places on the skin and need treatment.\nAggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It grows quickly in the lymph nodes and often the spleen, liver, bone marrow, or other organs are also affected. Signs and symptoms of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma may include\nfever\n,  drenching night sweats, and weight loss. These are also called B symptoms.\nPrimary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.\nThis type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of\ndiffuse large B-cell  lymphoma\n. It is marked by the overgrowth of\nfibrous\n(scar-like) lymph tissue. A\ntumor\nmost often forms behind the breastbone. It may press on the airways and cause coughing and trouble breathing. Most patients with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma are women who are age 30 to 40  years.\nFollicular large cell lymphoma\n, stage III.\nFollicular large cell lymphoma, stage III,  is a very rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment of this type of follicular lymphoma is more like treatment of aggressive NHL than of indolent NHL.\nAnaplastic large cell lymphoma.\nAnaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually begins in T lymphocytes. The cancer cells also have a\nmarker\ncalled CD30 on the surface of the cell.\nThere are two types of anaplastic large cell lymphoma:\nCutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma.\nThis type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma  mostly affects the skin, but other parts of the body may also be affected. Signs of cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma include one or more bumps or\nulcers\non the skin. This type of lymphoma is rare and indolent.\nSystemic\nanaplastic large cell lymphoma.\nThis type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma begins in the lymph nodes and may affect other parts of the body. This type of lymphoma is more aggressive.  Patients may have a lot of\nanaplastic\nlymphoma\nkinase\n(ALK) protein inside the lymphoma cells. These patients have a better\nprognosis\nthan patients who do not have extra ALK protein. Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma is more common in children than adults. For more information, see\nChildhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment\n.\nExtranodal\nNK\n-/\nT-cell lymphoma\n.\nExtranodal NK-/T-cell lymphoma usually begins in the area around the nose. It may also affect the\nparanasal sinus\n(hollow spaces in the bones around the nose), roof of the mouth,\ntrachea\n, skin, stomach, and\nintestines\n. Most cases of extranodal NK-/T-cell lymphoma have\nEpstein-Barr virus\nin the tumor cells. Sometimes hemophagocytic\nsyndrome\noccurs (a serious\ncondition\nin which there are too many active histiocytes and T cells that cause severe\ninflammation\nin the body). Treatment to suppress the immune system is needed. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is not common in the United States.\nLymphomatoid granulomatosis\n.\nLymphomatoid granulomatosis mostly affects the lungs. It may also affect the paranasal sinuses (hollow spaces in the bones around the nose), skin,\nkidneys\n, and\ncentral nervous system\n. In lymphomatoid granulomatosis, cancer invades the\nblood vessels\nand kills tissue. Because the  cancer may spread to the\nbrain\n,\nintrathecal chemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nto the brain is given.\nAngioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma\n.\nThis type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begins in T cells. Swollen lymph nodes are a common sign. Other signs may include a skin rash, fever, weight loss, or drenching night sweats. There may also be high levels of gamma globulin (antibodies) in the blood. Patients may also have opportunistic infections because their immune systems are weakened.\nPeripheral T-cell lymphoma\n.\nPeripheral T-cell lymphoma begins in mature T lymphocytes. This type of T lymphocyte matures in the thymus\ngland\nand travels to other lymphatic sites in the body such as the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and spleen. There are three subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphoma:\nHepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma.\nThis is an uncommon type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma that occurs mostly in young men. It begins in the liver and spleen and the cancer cells also have a  T-cell\nreceptor\ncalled gamma/delta on the surface of the cell.\nSubcutaneous\npanniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma.\nSubcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma begins in the skin or mucosa. It may occur with hemophagocytic syndrome (a serious condition in which there are too many active histiocytes and T cells that cause severe inflammation in the body). Treatment to suppress the immune system is needed.\nEnteropathy-type\nintestinal\nT-cell lymphoma.\nThis type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma occurs in the small\nbowel\nof patients with untreated\nceliac disease\n(an\nimmune response\nto gluten that causes\nmalnutrition\n). Patients who are diagnosed with celiac disease in childhood and stay on a gluten-free\ndiet\nrarely develop enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphoma.\nIntravascular large B-cell lymphoma.\nThis type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma affects blood vessels, especially the small blood vessels in the brain, kidney, lung, and skin. Signs and symptoms of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma are caused by blocked blood vessels. It is also called intravascular lymphomatosis.\nBurkitt lymphoma\n.\nBurkitt lymphoma is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that grows and spreads very quickly. It may affect the jaw, bones of the face, bowel, kidneys,\novaries\n, or other organs. There are three main types of Burkitt lymphoma (\nendemic\n,\nsporadic\n, and\nimmunodeficiency\nrelated). Endemic Burkitt lymphoma commonly occurs in Africa and is linked to the Epstein-Barr virus, and sporadic Burkitt lymphoma occurs throughout the world. Immunodeficiency-related Burkitt lymphoma is most often seen in patients who have\nAIDS\n. Burkitt lymphoma may spread to the brain and\nspinal cord\nand treatment to\nprevent\nits spread may be given. Burkitt lymphoma occurs most often in children and young adults. For more information, see\nChildhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment\n. Burkitt lymphoma is also called diffuse small noncleaved-cell lymphoma.\nLymphoblastic lymphoma\n.\nLymphoblastic lymphoma may begin in T cells or B cells, but it usually begins  in T cells. In this type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, there are too many\nlymphoblasts\n(immature white blood cells) in the lymph nodes and the thymus gland. These lymphoblasts may spread to other places in the body, such as the bone marrow, brain, and spinal cord. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is most common in teenagers and young adults. It is a lot like\nacute lymphoblastic leukemia\n(lymphoblasts are mostly found in the bone marrow and blood). For more information, see\nAdult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment\n.\nT-cell leukemia/lymphoma\n.\nT-cell leukemia/lymphoma is caused by the\nhuman T-cell leukemia virus type 1\n(HTLV-1). Signs include bone and skin\nlesions\n, high blood\ncalcium\nlevels, and  lymph nodes, spleen, and liver that are larger than normal.\nMantle cell lymphoma\n.\nMantle cell lymphoma is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually occurs in middle-aged or older adults. It begins in the lymph nodes and spreads to the spleen, bone marrow, blood, and sometimes the\nesophagus\n, stomach, and intestines. Patients with mantle cell lymphoma have too much of a protein called\ncyclin-D1\nor a certain\ngene\nchange in the lymphoma cells. In some patients who do not have signs or symptoms of lymphoma, delaying the start of treatment does not affect the prognosis.\nPosttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder\n.\nThis disease occurs in patients who have had a heart, lung, liver, kidney, or\npancreas\ntransplant\nand need lifelong\nimmunosuppressive therapy\n. Most posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders affect the B cells and  have Epstein-Barr virus in the cells. Lymphoproliferative disorders are often treated like cancer.\nTrue\nhistiocytic lymphoma\n.\nThis is a rare, very aggressive type of lymphoma. It is not known  whether it begins in B cells or T cells. It does not respond well to treatment with standard\nchemotherapy\n.\nPrimary effusion lymphoma\n.\nPrimary effusion lymphoma begins in B cells  that are found in an area where there is a large build-up of fluid, such as the areas between the lining of the lung and\nchest wall\n(\npleural effusion\n), the sac around the heart and the heart (\npericardial effusion\n), or in the abdominal\ncavity\n. There is usually no tumor that can be seen. This type of lymphoma often occurs in patients who are infected with\nHIV\n.\nPlasmablastic lymphoma\n.\nPlasmablastic lymphoma is a type of large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is very aggressive. It is most often seen in patients with HIV infection.\nOlder age, being male, and having a weakened immune system can increase the risk of\n\t\t  non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nAnything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and it can develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.\nThese and other risk factors may increase the risk of certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma:\nBeing older, male, or White.\nHaving one of the following medical conditions that weakens the immune system:\nAn\ninherited\nimmune\ndisorder\n(such as\nhypogammaglobulinemia\nor\nWiskott-Aldrich syndrome\n).\nAn autoimmune disease (such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n,\npsoriasis\n, or Sjögren syndrome).\nHIV/AIDS.\nHuman T-lymphotrophic virus type I or Epstein-Barr virus infection.\nHelicobacter pylori\ninfection.\nTaking\nimmunosuppressant\ndrugs\nafter an organ transplant.\nSigns and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, fever,\n\t\t  drenching night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue.\nThese signs and symptoms may be caused by non-Hodgkin\n\t\t  lymphoma or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the\n\t\t  following:\nSwelling in the lymph nodes in the neck, underarm,\n\t\t\t  groin, or stomach.\nFever for no known reason.\nDrenching night sweats.\nFeeling very tired.\nWeight loss for no known reason.\nSkin rash or itchy skin.\nPain in the chest, abdomen, or bones for no known reason.\nWhen fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss occur together, this group of symptoms is called B symptoms.\nOther signs and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma may occur and depend on the following:\nWhere the cancer forms in the body.\nThe size of the tumor.\nHow fast the tumor grows.\nTests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to  diagnose and stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\n: A  procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the protein that carries\noxygen\n) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by\n\t\t\t organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign\n\t\t\t of disease.\nLDH\ntest\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount  of lactic dehydrogenase. An increased amount of LDH in the blood may be a sign of tissue damage, lymphoma, or other diseases.\nHepatitis B\nand\nhepatitis C\ntest\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked to measure the amounts of hepatitis B virus-specific\nantigens\nand/or antibodies and the amounts of hepatitis C virus-specific antibodies. These antigens or antibodies are called markers. Different markers or combinations of markers are used to determine whether a patient has a hepatitis B or C infection, has had a prior infection or\nvaccination\n, or is susceptible to infection. Patients who have been treated for hepatitis B virus in the past need continued\nmonitoring\nto check if it has\nreactivated\n. Knowing whether a person has hepatitis B or C may help plan treatment.\nHIV test\n: A test to measure the level of HIV antibodies in a sample of blood.  Antibodies are made by the body when it is invaded by a\nforeign\nsubstance. A high level of HIV antibodies may mean the body has been infected with HIV.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n:\n\t\t  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and lymph nodes, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nPET scan\n(positron\n\t\t  emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor cells in the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\n: The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow and bone under a\nmicroscope\nto look for signs of cancer.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After  a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle is inserted into the patient’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow   are removed for examination under a microscope.\nLymph node biopsy\n: The\n\t\t\t removal of all or part of a  lymph node. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells. One of the following  types of biopsies  may be done:\nExcisional\n\t\t\t\t  biopsy\n: The removal of an entire lymph node.\nIncisional\n\t\t\t\t  biopsy\n: The removal of part of a lymph node.\nCore biopsy\n:  The removal of part of a lymph node using a wide needle.\nIf cancer is found, the following tests may be done to study the cancer cells:\nImmunohistochemistry\n:  A\nlaboratory test\nthat uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A laboratory test in which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nImmunophenotyping\n: A laboratory test that uses antibodies to identify cancer cells based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of lymphoma.\nFISH\n(fluorescence in situ hybridization)\n: A laboratory test used to look at and count genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of\nDNA\nthat contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient’s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.\nOther tests and procedures may be done depending on the signs and symptoms seen and where the cancer forms in the body.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe prognosis and treatment options depend on the following:\nThe patient's signs and symptoms, including whether or not they have B symptoms (fever for no known reason, weight loss for no known reason, or drenching  night sweats).\nThe\nstage\nof the cancer (the size of the cancer tumors and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body or lymph nodes).\nThe type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nThe amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the blood.\nWhether there are certain changes in the genes.\nThe patient’s age, sex, and\n\t\t  general health.\nWhether the lymphoma is newly diagnosed, continues to grow during treatment, or has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nFor non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy, treatment options also depend on:\nThe wishes of the patient.\nWhich trimester of pregnancy the patient is in.\nWhether the baby can be delivered early.\nSome types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma spread more quickly than\n\t\t  others do. Most non-Hodgkin lymphomas that occur during pregnancy are\n\t\t  aggressive. Delaying treatment\n\t\t  of aggressive lymphoma until after the baby is born may lessen the mother's chance of survival. Immediate\n\t\t  treatment is often recommended, even during pregnancy.\nStages of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\nKey Points\nAfter non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out\n\t\t  whether cancer cells have spread within the lymph\n\t\t  system or to other parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nThe following stages are used for non-Hodgkin\n\t\t  lymphoma:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nNon-Hodgkin lymphomas may be grouped for treatment according to whether the cancer is indolent or aggressive, whether affected lymph nodes are next to each other in the body, and whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or recurrent.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma  can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nAfter non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out\n\t\t  whether cancer cells have spread within the lymph\n\t\t  system or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out the type of\ncancer\nand if cancer\ncells\nhave spread within the\nlymph system\nor to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The\n\t\t  information gathered from the staging process determines the\nstage\nof the\n\t\t  disease. It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. The results of the\ntests and procedures\ndone to\ndiagnose\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nare used to help make decisions about treatment.\nThe following tests and procedures may also be used in the staging\n\t\t  process:\nMRI\n(magnetic\n\t\t  resonance imaging) with\ngadolinium\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\nbrain\nand\nspinal cord\n. A substance called gadolinium is\ninjected\ninto the patient through a\nvein\n. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nLumbar puncture\n: A procedure used to collect\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) from the\nspinal column\n. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the\nspine\nand into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\nEnlarge\nLumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.\nFor\npregnant\nwomen with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, staging tests and procedures that protect the\nfetus\nfrom the harms of\nradiation\nare used. These tests and procedures include MRI (without contrast), lumbar puncture, and\nultrasound\n.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for non-Hodgkin\n\t\t  lymphoma:\nStage I\nEnlarge\nStage I adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in one or more lymph nodes in a group of lymph nodes or, in rare cases, cancer is found in the Waldeyer’s ring, thymus, or spleen. In stage IE (not shown), cancer has spread to one area outside the lymph system.\nStage I non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nis divided into stages I and IE.\nIn stage I,\ncancer\nis found in one of the following places in the\nlymph system\n:\nOne or more\nlymph nodes\nin a group of lymph nodes.\nWaldeyer's ring\n.\nThymus\n.\nSpleen\n.\nIn stage IE, cancer is found in one area outside the lymph system.\nStage II\nStage II non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nis divided into stages II and IIE.\nIn stage II,\ncancer\nis found in two or more groups of\nlymph nodes\nthat are either above the\ndiaphragm\nor below the diaphragm.\nEnlarge\nStage II adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are either above the diaphragm or below the diaphragm.\nIn stage IIE, cancer has spread from a group of lymph nodes to a nearby area that is outside the\nlymph system\n. Cancer may have spread to other lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm.\nEnlarge\nStage IIE adult lymphoma. Cancer has spread from a group of lymph nodes to a nearby area that is outside the lymph system. Cancer may have spread to other lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm.\nIn stage II, the term\nbulky disease\nrefers to a larger\ntumor\nmass. The size of the tumor mass that is referred to as bulky disease varies based on the type of\nlymphoma\n.\nStage III\nEnlarge\nStage III adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in groups of lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm; or in a group of lymph nodes above the diaphragm and in the spleen.\nIn\nstage III non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n,\ncancer\nis found:\nin groups of\nlymph nodes\nboth above and below the\ndiaphragm\n; or\nin lymph nodes above the diaphragm and in the\nspleen\n.\nStage IV\nEnlarge\nStage IV adult lymphoma. Cancer (a) has spread throughout one or more organs outside the lymph system; or (b) is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are either above the diaphragm or below the diaphragm and in one organ that is outside the lymph system and not near the affected lymph nodes; or (c) is found in groups of lymph nodes above the diaphragm and below the diaphragm and in any organ that is outside the lymph system; or (d) is found in the liver, bone marrow, more than one place in the lung, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The cancer has not spread directly into the liver, bone marrow, lung, or CSF from nearby lymph nodes.\nIn\nstage IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n,\ncancer\n:\nhas spread throughout one or more\norgans\noutside the\nlymph system\n; or\nis found in two or more groups of\nlymph nodes\nthat are either above the\ndiaphragm\nor below the diaphragm and in one organ that is outside the lymph system and not near the affected lymph nodes; or\nis found in groups of lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm and in any organ that is outside the lymph system; or\nis found in the\nliver\n,\nbone marrow\n, more than one place in the\nlung\n, or\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF). The cancer has not spread directly into the liver, bone marrow, lung, or CSF from nearby lymph nodes.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphomas may be grouped for treatment according to whether the cancer is indolent or aggressive, whether affected lymph nodes are next to each other in the body, and whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or recurrent.\nFor more information on the types of\nindolent\n(slow-growing) and\naggressive\n(fast-growing) non-Hodgkin lymphoma, see the\nGeneral Information\nsection.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma can also be described as\ncontiguous\nor\nnoncontiguous\n:\nContiguous lymphomas:\nLymphomas\nin which the\nlymph nodes\nwith cancer are next\n\t\t  to each other.\nNoncontiguous lymphomas: Lymphomas in which the lymph nodes with cancer\n\t\t  are not next to each other, but are on the same side of the\ndiaphragm\n.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma  can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nThe lymphoma may come back\n\t\tin the lymph system or in other parts of the body. Indolent lymphoma may come back as\n\t\taggressive lymphoma. Aggressive\n\t\tlymphoma may come back as indolent lymphoma.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nPatients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment\n\t\t  planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating lymphomas.\nTreatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma may cause side effects.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nTargeted therapy\nPlasmapheresis\nWatchful waiting\nAntibiotic therapy\nSurgery\nStem cell transplant\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nVaccine therapy\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some\n\t\t  are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.\n\t\t  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help\n\t\t  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients\n\t\t  with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nFor\npregnant\nwomen with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment is carefully chosen to protect the\nfetus\n. Treatment decisions are based on the mother’s wishes, the\nstage\nof the non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and the trimester of the pregnancy. The treatment plan may change as the\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\n, cancer, and pregnancy change. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.\nPatients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment\n\t\t  planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating lymphomas.\nTreatment will be overseen by a\nmedical\n\t\t  oncologist\n, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer, or a\nhematologist\n, a doctor who specializes in treating\nblood cancers\n. The\n\t\t  medical oncologist may refer you to other\nhealth care providers\nwho have experience and\n\t\t  are experts in treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain\n\t\t  areas of\nmedicine\n. These may include the following\nspecialists\n:\nNeurosurgeon\n.\nNeurologist\n.\nRadiation\n\t\t\t oncologist\n.\nEndocrinologist\n.\nRehabilitation specialist\n.\nFertility specialist\n.\nOther\noncology\nspecialists.\nTreatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSide effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called\nlate effects\n. Treatment with\nchemotherapy\n,\nradiation therapy\n, or\nstem cell transplant\nfor non-Hodgkin lymphoma may increase the risk of  late effects.\nLate effects of cancer treatment may include the following:\nHeart problems.\nInfertility\n(inability to have children).\nLoss of\nbone density\n.\nNeuropathy\n(\nnerve\ndamage that causes numbness or trouble walking).\nA\nsecond cancer\n, such as:\nLung cancer\n.\nBrain cancer.\nKidney cancer\n.\nBladder cancer\n.\nMelanoma\n.\nHodgkin lymphoma\n.\nMyelodysplastic syndrome\n.\nAcute myeloid leukemia\n.\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your doctor about the effects cancer treatment can have on you. Regular\nfollow-up\nto check for late effects is important.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer\ncells\nor keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Sometimes\ntotal-body irradiation\nis given before a\nstem cell transplant\n.\nProton beam radiation therapy\nis a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of\nprotons\n(tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill\ntumor\ncells. This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy\ntissue\nnear a tumor such as the heart or\nbreast\n.\nExternal radiation therapy is used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and may also be used as\npalliative therapy\nto relieve symptoms and improve\nquality of life\n.\nFor a pregnant woman with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, radiation therapy should be given after delivery, if possible, to avoid any risk to the fetus. If treatment is needed right away, the woman  may decide to continue the pregnancy and receive radiation therapy. A\nlead shield\nis used to cover the pregnant woman's\nabdomen\nto help protect the fetus from radiation as much as possible.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(\nintrathecal chemotherapy\n), an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n).\nCombination chemotherapy\nis treatment using two or more anticancer drugs.\nSteroid drugs\nmay be added, to lessen\ninflammation\nand lower the body's\nimmune response\n.\nSystemic combination chemotherapy is used for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nIntrathecal chemotherapy may also be used in the treatment of\nlymphoma\nthat first forms in the\ntesticles\nor\nsinuses\n(hollow areas) around the nose,\ndiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\n,\nBurkitt lymphoma\n,\nlymphoblastic lymphoma\n, and some\naggressive\nT-cell lymphomas\n. It is given  to lessen the chance that lymphoma cells will spread to the brain and\nspinal cord\n. This is called\nCNS prophylaxis\n.\nEnlarge\nIntrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.\nWhen a pregnant woman is treated with chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the fetus cannot be protected from being exposed to chemotherapy. Some chemotherapy regimens may cause birth defects if given in the first trimester.\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient’s\nimmune system\nto fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer.\nImmunomodulators\n:\nLenalidomide\nis an immunomodulator used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nCAR T-cell therapy: The patient's\nT cells\n(a type of immune system cell) are changed so they will attack certain\nproteins\non the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special\nreceptors\nare added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called\nchimeric antigen receptor\n(CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by\ninfusion\n. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's\nblood\nand attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy (such as\naxicabtagene ciloleucel\nor\ntisagenlecleucel\n) is used to  treat large\nB-cell lymphoma\nthat has not\nresponded\nto treatment. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied  to treat\nmantle cell lymphoma\nthat has\nrelapsed\nor not responded to treatment.\nEnlarge\nCAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient’s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient’s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\n.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.\nMonoclonal\n\t\t\t\tantibody\ntherapy\n,\nproteasome inhibitor\ntherapy, and\nkinase inhibitor\ntherapy are types of targeted therapy used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nMonoclonal\n\t\t\t\tantibody therapy: Monoclonal antibodies are\nimmune system\nproteins made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer.  As a cancer treatment, these\nantibodies\ncan attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow.  The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading.  Monoclonal antibodies are given by\ninfusion\n.  They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or\nradioactive\nmaterial directly to cancer cells.\nTypes of monoclonal antibodies include:\nRituximab\n, used to treat many types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nObinutuzumab\n, used to treat\nfollicular lymphoma\n.\nMogamulizumab\n, used to treat certain types of\nrelapsed\nor\nrefractory\nT-cell lymphoma\n.\nTafasitamab\ncombined with  lenalidomide to treat relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\nPembrolizumab\nto treat\nprimary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma\n.\nPolatuzumab vedotin\n, combined with\nbendamustine\nand rituximab to treat relapsed or refractory\ndiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\n.\nBrentuximab vedotin\n, which contains a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called\nCD30\nthat is found on some lymphoma cells. It also contains an anticancer drug that may help kill cancer cells.\nYttrium Y 90-ibritumomab tiuxetan\n,  an example of a\nradiolabeled\nmonoclonal antibody.\nMosunetuzumab\n, which is a\nbispecific monoclonal antibody\nthat helps the body's immune system recognize and kill cancer cells. It is used to treat relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nProteasome inhibitor therapy: This treatment blocks the action of proteasomes in cancer cells. Proteasomes remove\nproteins\nno longer needed by the cell. When the proteasomes are blocked, the proteins build up in the cell and may cause the cancer cell to die.\nBortezomib\nor\nixazomib\nis used to decrease how much\nimmunoglobulin\nM is in the blood after cancer treatment for\nlymphoplasmacytic lymphoma\n(Waldenström macroglobulinemia). It is also being studied to treat\nrelapsed\nmantle cell lymphoma\n.\nKinase inhibitor therapy: This treatment  blocks certain proteins, which may help keep lymphoma cells from growing and may kill them. Kinase inhibitor therapies include:\nIbrutinib\n,\nacalabrutinib\n, and\nzanubrutinib\n, which are types of Bruton\ntyrosine kinase inhibitor\ntherapy. They are used to treat mantle cell lymphoma. Ibrutinib and acalabrutinib are also used to treat lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and zanubrutinib is being studied to treat it.\nHistone methyltransferase inhibitor\ntherapy:\nTazemetostat\nis used to treat follicular lymphoma that has come back or has not gotten better with other treatment. It is used in adults whose cancer has a certain\nmutation\n(change) in the\nEZH2 gene\nthat has already been treated with at least two other anticancer therapies.\nB-cell lymphoma-2\n(BCL-2) inhibitor therapy:\nVenetoclax\nmay be used to treat mantle cell lymphoma. It blocks the action of a protein called  BCL-2 and  may help kill cancer cells.\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\n.\nPlasmapheresis\nIf the blood becomes thick with extra antibody proteins and affects\ncirculation\n,\nplasmapheresis\nis done to remove extra\nplasma\nand antibody proteins from the blood. In this procedure, blood is removed from the patient and sent through a  machine that separates the plasma (the liquid part of the blood) from the blood cells. The patient's plasma contains the unneeded antibodies and is not returned to the patient. The normal blood cells are returned to the bloodstream along with\ndonated\nplasma or a plasma  replacement. Plasmapheresis does not keep new antibodies from forming.\nWatchful waiting\nWatchful waiting\nis\n\t\t\t closely\nmonitoring\na patient’s\ncondition\nwithout giving any treatment until\n\t\t\t signs or symptoms appear or change.\nAntibiotic therapy\nAntibiotic\ntherapy is a treatment that uses drugs to treat\ninfections\nand cancer caused by\nbacteria\nand other\nmicroorganisms\n.\nSurgery\nSurgery\nmay be used to remove the lymphoma in certain patients with\nindolent\nor\naggressive\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nThe type of surgery used depends on where the lymphoma formed in the body:\nLocal\nexcision\nfor certain patients with\nmucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma\n, PTLD, and small bowel T-cell lymphoma.\nSplenectomy\nfor patients with\nmarginal zone lymphoma\nof the\nspleen\n.\nPatients who have a heart,\nlung\n,\nliver\n,\nkidney\n, or\npancreas\ntransplant\nusually need to take drugs to suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives. Long-term\nimmunosuppression\nafter an organ transplant can cause a certain type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma called\nposttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder\n(PLTD).\nSmall\nbowel\nsurgery is often needed to\ndiagnose\nceliac disease\nin adults who develop a type of T-cell lymphoma.\nStem cell transplant\nStem cell transplant is a method of giving high\ndoses\nof chemotherapy and/or total-body irradiation and then replacing blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient (\nautologous transplant\n) or a\ndonor\n(\nallogeneic transplant\n) and are frozen and stored.  After the chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.  These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body’s blood cells.\nEnlarge\nDonor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in\n\t\t  clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied.\n\t\t  Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nVaccine therapy\nVaccine therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses a substance or group of substances to stimulate the immune system to find the\ntumor\nand kill it.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nindolent\nstage I\nand indolent,\ncontiguous\nstage II\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nmay include\n\t\t  the following:\nRadiation therapy\n.\nMonoclonal antibody\ntherapy\n(\nrituximab\n) and/or\nchemotherapy\n.\nWatchful waiting\n.\nIf the\ntumor\nis too large to be treated with radiation therapy, the treatment options for indolent,\nnoncontiguous\nstage II\n,\nIII\n, or\nIV\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma will be used.\nTreatment of indolent, noncontiguous stage II, III, or IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma may include the following:\nWatchful waiting for patients who do not have\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\n.\nMonoclonal\n\t\t\t antibody therapy (rituximab) with or without chemotherapy.\nLenalidomide\nand rituximab.\nMaintenance therapy\nwith rituximab.\nMonoclonal antibody therapy (\nobinutuzumab\n) with or without chemotherapy.\nEZH2\ninhibitor therapy (\ntazemetostat\n).\nRadiolabeled\nmonoclonal antibody\n\t\t\t therapy.\nA\nclinical trial\nof\nhigh-dose chemotherapy\nwith or without\ntotal-body irradiation\nor radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy, followed by\nautologous\nor\nallogeneic  stem cell transplant\n.\nA clinical trial of chemotherapy with or without\nvaccine therapy\n.\nA clinical trial of new types of monoclonal antibodies.\nA clinical trial of radiation therapy that includes nearby\nlymph nodes\n, for patients who have stage III disease.\nA clinical trial of\nlow-dose radiation therapy\n, to relieve symptoms and improve\nquality of life\n.\nOther treatments for indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma depend on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

        "question": "How to prevent Oral Cavity and Oropharyngeal Cancer ?",
        "right_answer": "Key Points\n                    - Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.    - The following are risk factors for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer:         - Tobacco use     - Alcohol use     - Tobacco and alcohol use     - Betel quid or gutka chewing     - Personal history of head and neck cancer        - The following is a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer:         - HPV infection        - The following is a protective factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer:         - Quitting smoking        - It is not clear whether avoiding certain risk factors will decrease the risk of oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer.    - Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.    -  New ways to prevent oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.\n                \n                \n                    Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.\n                    Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.    Oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer are two different diseases, but they have some risk factors in common.\n                \n                \n                    The following are risk factors for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer:\n                    Tobacco use    Using tobacco is the most common cause of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. The risk of these cancers is about 5 to 10 times higher for current smokers than for people who have never smoked.    The use of all types of tobacco, including cigarettes, pipes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco) can cause cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx. For cigarette smokers, the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day.       Alcohol use    Using alcohol is also an important risk factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer.    The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per day. The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is about twice as high in people who have 3 to 4 alcoholic drinks per day and 5 times higher in people who have 5 or more alcoholic drinks per day compared with those who don't drink alcohol.       Tobacco and alcohol use    The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is 2 to 3 times higher in people who use both tobacco and alcohol than it is in people who use only tobacco or only alcohol. The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is about 35 times higher in people who smoke 2 or more packs of cigarettes per day and have more than 4 alcoholic drinks per day than it is in people who have never smoked cigarettes or consumed alcohol.        Betel quid or gutka chewing    Chewing betel quid or gutka (betel quid mixed with tobacco) has been shown to increase the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. Betel quid contains areca nut, which is a cancer-causing substance. The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with how long and how often betel quid or gutka are chewed. The risk for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is higher when chewing gutka than when chewing betel quid alone. Betel quid and gutka chewing is common in many countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia, including China and India.        Personal history of head and neck cancer    A personal history of head and neck cancer increases the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer.\n                \n                \n                    The following is a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer:\n                    HPV infection    Being infected with certain types of HPV, especially HPV type 16, increases the risk of oropharyngeal cancer.

        "context": "Oral Cavity, Oropharyngeal, Hypopharyngeal, and Laryngeal Cancers Prevention (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nWhat is prevention?\nCancer\nprevention\nis action taken to lower the chance of getting \n         cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer \n         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower \n         the number of deaths caused by cancer.\nTo prevent new cancers from starting,\nscientists\nlook at\nrisk \n         factors\nand\nprotective factors\n. Anything that increases your \n         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; \n         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is \n         called a cancer protective factor.\nSome risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. \n         For example, both smoking and\ninheriting\ncertain\ngenes\nare \n         risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be \n         avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy\ndiet\nmay be protective \n         factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and \n         increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does \n         not mean that you will not get cancer.\nDifferent ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including:\nChanging lifestyle or eating habits.\nAvoiding things known to cause cancer.\nTaking\nmedicines\nto treat a\nprecancerous\ncondition\nor to \n         keep cancer from starting.\nFor information about\nscreening\n,\ndiagnosis\n, and treatment of\noral cavity\n,\noropharyngeal\n,\nhypopharyngeal\n, and\nlaryngeal cancer\n, see the following:\nOral Cavity and Nasopharyngeal Cancers Screening\nLip and Oral Cavity Cancer  Treatment (Adult)\nOropharyngeal Cancer Treatment (Adult)\nCigarette Smoking:  Health Risks and How to Quit\nLaryngeal Cancer Treatment\nHypopharyngeal Cancer Treatment (Adult)\nGeneral Information About Oral Cavity, Oropharyngeal, Hypopharyngeal, and Laryngeal Cancers\nOral cavity\n,\npharyngeal\n, and\nlaryngeal cancers\nusually form in the\nsquamous cells\n(thin, flat\ncells\nlining the inside of the\noral cavity\n,\npharynx\n, and\nlarynx\n).\nOral cavity cancer forms in any of these\ntissues\nof the oral cavity:\nThe lips.\nThe front two thirds of the tongue.\nThe gingiva (gums).\nThe buccal mucosa (the lining of the inside of the cheeks).\nThe floor (bottom) of the mouth under the tongue.\nThe hard palate (the front, bony part of the roof of the mouth).\nThe retromolar trigone (the small area behind the\nwisdom teeth\n).\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the oral cavity. The oral cavity includes the lips, hard palate (the bony front portion of the roof of the mouth), soft palate (the muscular back portion of the roof of the mouth), retromolar trigone (the area behind the wisdom teeth), front two-thirds of the tongue, gingiva (gums), buccal mucosa (the inner lining of the lips and cheeks), and floor of the mouth under the tongue.\nPharyngeal cancer forms in any of these tissues of the pharynx (throat):\nThe\nnasopharynx\n(the upper part of the throat behind the nose).\nThe\noropharynx\n, which includes the following tissues:\nThe middle part of the throat behind the mouth.\nThe back one third of the tongue.\nThe\nsoft palate\n(the back of the roof of the mouth), including the\nuvula\n.\nThe side and back walls of the throat.\nThe\ntonsils\n.\nThe\nhypopharynx\n(the bottom part of the throat).\nCancers of the nasopharynx have causes,\nscreening\n,\nrisk  factors\n, and  treatment approaches which are distinct from other cancers of the pharynx. For more information, see\nNasopharyngeal Cancer Treatment (Adult)\nand\nOral Cavity and Nasopharyngeal Cancers Screening\n.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the pharynx. The pharynx is a hollow, muscular tube inside the neck that starts behind the nose and opens into the larynx and esophagus. The three parts of the pharynx are the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx.\nLaryngeal cancer forms in any of these tissues of the larynx (voice box):\nThe supraglottis (the area above the vocal cords, including the epiglottis).\nThe vocal cords (two small bands of muscle within the larynx that vibrate to produce the voice).\nThe glottis (the middle part of the larynx, including the vocal cords).\nThe subglottis (the lowest part of the larynx, from just below the vocal cords to the top of the trachea).\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the larynx. The three parts of the larynx are the supraglottis (including the epiglottis), the glottis (including the vocal cords), and the subglottis.\nOral cavity cancer and\noropharyngeal cancer\n: Men are more than twice as likely as women to have oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer and die from it.\nHypopharyngeal cancer\n: Hypopharyngeal cancer is rare. The number of new cases of hypopharyngeal cancer has slightly decreased over the past twenty years. The decrease in new cases is likely because of a decrease in\ncigarette\nsmoking.\nNasopharyngeal cancer\n: Nasopharyngeal cancer is rare in the United States. It is more common in parts of Asia, the Arctic region, North Africa, and the Middle East.\nLaryngeal cancer: Laryngeal cancer is less common than oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers. The number of new cases of laryngeal cancer has slightly decreased over the past ten years. The decrease in new cases is likely because of a decrease in cigarette smoking.\nOral Cavity, Oropharyngeal, Hypopharyngeal, and Laryngeal Cancers Prevention\nKey Points\nAvoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may \n         help prevent  cancer.\nThe following are\nrisk\nfactors for oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers:\nTobacco use\nAlcohol use\nTobacco and alcohol use\nBetel quid chewing\nPersonal history of  head and neck cancer\nThe following is a risk factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer:\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infection\nThe following is a\nprotective\nfactor for oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers:\nQuitting smoking\nIt is not clear whether avoiding certain risk factors will decrease the risk of oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers.\nCancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways \n    to prevent cancer.\nNew ways to prevent oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers are being studied in clinical \n     trials.\nAvoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may \n         help prevent  cancer.\nAvoiding\ncancer\nrisk factors\nmay help\nprevent\ncertain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, having\noverweight\n, and not getting enough exercise.  Increasing\nprotective factors\nsuch as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.\nOral cavity\n,\noropharyngeal\n,\nhypopharyngeal\n, and\nlaryngeal cancers\nhave common\nrisk factors\n.\nThe following are\nrisk\nfactors for oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers:\nTobacco use\nUsing\ntobacco\nis the most common cause of oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers. The risk of these\ncancers\nis about 5 to 10 times higher for current smokers than for people who have never smoked, and is linked to how much and how long the person has smoked.\nThe use of all types of tobacco, including\ncigarettes\n,\npipes\n,\ncigars\n, and\nsmokeless tobacco\n(\nsnuff\nand\nchewing tobacco\n) can cause  cancers of the\noral cavity\n,\noropharynx\n,\nhypopharynx\n, and\nlarynx\n.\nAlcohol use\nUsing\nalcohol\nis also an important   risk factor for oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers.\nThe risk of oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers increases with the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per day. The risk of these cancers is 2 to 6 times higher in people who have 2 or more alcoholic drinks per day compared with those who don't drink alcohol.\nTobacco and alcohol use\nThe risk of oral cavity,\noropharyngeal\n,\nhypopharyngeal\n, and laryngeal cancers is higher in people who use both tobacco and alcohol than it is  in people who use only tobacco or only alcohol.  The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is about 5 to 14 times higher in people who both smoke and drink heavily than it is in people who  never smoke cigarettes or consume alcohol.\nBetel quid chewing\nChewing\nbetel quid\nalone or with added tobacco has been shown to increase the risk of oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers. Betel quid contains areca nut, which is a cancer-causing substance.  The risk of these cancers increases with how long and how often betel quid is chewed. The risk is higher when chewing betel quid with tobacco than when chewing betel quid alone. Betel quid chewing is common in many countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia, including China and India.\nPersonal history of  head and neck cancer\nA\npersonal history\nof head and neck cancer increases the risk of oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers.\nThe following is a risk factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer:\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infection\nBeing\ninfected\nwith  certain types of\nhuman papillomavirus\n(HPV), especially HPV-16, increases the risk of oropharyngeal cancers. HPV infection may also increase the risk of some oral cavity cancers. HPV infection is spread mainly through sexual contact.\nThe risk of oropharyngeal cancer is about 15 times higher in people  who have\noral\nHPV-16 infection compared with people who do not have oral HPV-16 infection.\nThe following is a\nprotective\nfactor for oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers:\nQuitting smoking\nStudies have shown that when people stop smoking cigarettes, their risk of  oral cavity,  oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers decreases by one half (50%) within 5 to 9 years. Within 20 years of quitting,  their risk of these cancers is the same as for a person who never smoked cigarettes.\nIt is not clear whether avoiding certain risk factors will decrease the risk of oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers.\nSome studies show that when people stop drinking alcohol, their risk of  oral cavity and laryngeal cancers decreases within about 20 years.\nGetting an\nHPV vaccination\ngreatly lessens the risk of oral HPV infection. It is not yet known whether getting an HPV vaccination at any age will decrease the risk of oropharyngeal cancer from HPV infection. For information about the use of HPV vaccination to prevent cervical cancer, see\nCervical Cancer Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention\n.\nCancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways \n    to prevent cancer.\nCancer\nprevention\nclinical trials\nare used to study ways to \n         lower the risk of     certain types of cancer. Some \n         cancer prevention trials are done with healthy people who \n         have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. \n         Other prevention trials are done with people who have had \n         cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type \n         or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. \n         Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known \n         to have any risk factors for cancer.\nThe purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to \n         find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer.

        "question": "How to diagnose Neuroblastoma ?",
        "right_answer": "Tests that examine many different body tissues and fluids are used to detect (find) and diagnose neuroblastoma. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.    -   Urine catecholamine studies: A procedure in which a urine sample is checked to measure the amount of certain substances, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), that are made when catecholamines break down and are released into the urine. A higher than normal amount of VMA or HVA can be a sign of neuroblastoma.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   X-ray : An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   mIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) scan : A procedure used to find neuroendocrine tumors, such as neuroblastoma. A very small amount of a substance called radioactive mIBG is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. Neuroendocrine tumor cells take up the radioactive mIBG and are detected by a scanner. Scans may be taken over 1-3 days. An iodine solution may be given before or during the test to keep the thyroid gland from absorbing too much of the mIBG. This test is also used to find out how well the tumor is responding to treatment. mIBG is used in high doses to treat neuroblastoma.    -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.    -  Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. An ultrasound exam is not done if a CT/MRI has been done.",
        "context": "Neuroblastoma Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Neuroblastoma\nKey Points\nNeuroblastoma is a type of cancer that forms in neuroblasts (immature nerve tissue) in the adrenal glands, neck, chest, or spinal cord.\nCertain genetic conditions affect the risk of having neuroblastoma.\nGenetic testing can determine whether a child has an inherited form of neuroblastoma.\nSometimes children with certain gene mutations should be checked for signs of neuroblastoma.\nSigns and symptoms of neuroblastoma include bone pain or a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest.\nTests that examine many different body tissues and fluids are used to diagnose neuroblastoma.\nGetting a second opinion.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nNeuroblastoma is a type of cancer that forms in neuroblasts (immature nerve tissue) in the adrenal glands, neck, chest, or spinal cord.\nNeuroblastoma often begins in the\nnerve\ntissue of the\nadrenal glands\n. There are two adrenal glands, one on top of each\nkidney\nin the back of the upper\nabdomen\n. The adrenal glands make important\nhormones\nthat help control\nheart rate\n,\nblood pressure\n,\nblood sugar\n, and the way the body reacts to\nstress\n.\nEnlarge\nNeuroblastoma may be found in the adrenal glands and paraspinal nerve tissue from the neck to the pelvis.\nNeuroblastoma most often begins in infancy. It is usually diagnosed between the first month of life and age 5 years. The tumor is found when it begins to grow and cause\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\n. Sometimes it forms before birth and is found during an\nultrasound\nof the baby.\nBy the time cancer is diagnosed, it has usually\nmetastasized\n(spread). Neuroblastoma spreads most often to the\nlymph nodes\n, bones,\nbone marrow\n,\nliver\n, and skin in infants and children.\nAdolescents\nmay also have\nmetastasis\nto the\nlungs\nand\nbrain\n.\nCertain genetic conditions affect the risk of having neuroblastoma.\nNeuroblastoma is caused by certain changes to the way neuroblast cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. There are many risk factors for neuroblastoma, but many do not directly cause cancer. Instead, they increase the chance of\nDNA\ndamage in cells that may lead to neuroblastoma. To learn more about how cancer develops, see\nWhat Is Cancer?\nA risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors can be changed. Risk factors also include things people cannot change, like\nfamily history\n. It's important to learn about risk factors for neuroblastoma because it can help you make choices for\nscreening\nfor cancer.\nPossible risk factors for neuroblastoma include:\nHaving certain changes in\ngenes\n(\nALK\nor\nPHOX2B\n).\nHaving certain\ngenetic\nconditions, such as:\nCostello syndrome\nNoonan syndrome\nneurofibromatosis type 1\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome\npheochromocytoma/paraganglioma\nsyndromes\nROHHAD syndromes (rapid-onset\nobesity\n,\nhypothalamic\ndysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysfunction)\nHaving a strong family history of neuroblastoma.\nGenetic testing can determine whether a child has an inherited form of neuroblastoma.\nGene\nmutations\nthat increase the risk of neuroblastoma are sometimes\ninherited\n(passed from the parent to the child). In children with a gene mutation, neuroblastoma usually occurs at a younger age, and more than one tumor may form in the adrenal glands or in the nerve tissue in the neck, chest, abdomen, or\npelvis\n.\nIt is not always clear from the\nfamily medical history\nwhether a condition is inherited. Certain families may benefit from\ngenetic counseling\nand\ngenetic testing\n. Genetic counselors and other specially trained health professionals can discuss a child's diagnosis and the family's medical history to understand:\ntheir options for\nALK\nor\nPHOX2B\ngene testing\nthe risk of neuroblastoma for the child and the child's siblings\nthe risks and benefits of learning genetic information\nGenetic counselors can also help parents\ncope\nwith their child's genetic testing results, including how to discuss the results with family members.\nOnce it is known that the child has an inherited form of neuroblastoma, other family members can be screened for the\nALK\nor\nPHOX2B\nmutation.\nSometimes children with certain gene mutations should be checked for signs of neuroblastoma.\nChildren with certain gene mutations or\nhereditary\n(inherited)\nsyndromes\nshould be checked for signs of neuroblastoma until they are 10 years old. The following tests may be used:\nAbdominal ultrasound\n: A test in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the abdomen and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of the abdomen called a\nsonogram\n.\nUrine\ncatecholamine\nstudies\n: A test in which a urine sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), that are made when catecholamines break down and are released into the urine. A higher-than-normal amount of VMA or HVA can be a sign of neuroblastoma.\nChest x-ray\n: An\nx-ray\nof the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nTalk to your child's doctor about how often these tests need to be done.\nSigns and symptoms of neuroblastoma include bone pain or a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest.\nThe most common signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma are caused by the tumor pressing on nearby tissues as it grows or by cancer spreading to the bone.\nCheck with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:\nlump in the abdomen, neck, or chest\nbone pain\nswollen stomach and trouble breathing  (in infants)\nbulging eyes\ndark circles around the eyes (\"black eyes\")\npainless, bluish lumps under the skin (in infants)\nweakness or\nparalysis\n(loss of ability to move a body part)\nLess common signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma include the following:\nfever\nshortness of breath\nfeeling tired\neasy bruising or bleeding\npetechiae\n(flat, pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding)\nhigh blood pressure\nsevere watery\ndiarrhea\nHorner syndrome\n(droopy eyelid, smaller\npupil\n, and less sweating on one side of the face)\njerky muscle movements\nuncontrolled eye movements\nThese and other signs and symptoms may be caused by neuroblastoma or by other conditions. The only way to know is to see your child's doctor. The doctor will ask you when the symptoms started and how often your child has been having them as a first step in making a diagnosis.\nTests that examine many different body tissues and fluids are used to diagnose neuroblastoma.\nIf your child has symptoms that suggest neuroblastoma, their doctor will need to find out if these are due to cancer or another condition. They will ask about your child's personal and family medical history and do a\nphysical exam\n.\nDepending on your child's symptoms and medical history and the results of their physical and\nneurological exam\n, the doctor may recommend more tests to find out if your child has neuroblastoma, and if so, its extent (\nstage\n). If neuroblastoma is diagnosed, the results of these tests and procedures will help you and your child's doctor make decisions about treatment.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nUrine catecholamine studies\n: A test in which a urine sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), that are made when catecholamines break down and are released into the urine. A higher-than-normal amount of VMA or HVA can be a sign of neuroblastoma.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. A higher-than-normal amount of\nlactate dehydrogenase\n(LDH) can be a sign of disease.\nFerritin\nlevel\n: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of ferritin (a\nprotein\nthat stores\niron\nin cells). A higher-than-normal amount may be a sign of disease.\nMIBG  scan\n: A procedure used to find\nneuroendocrine tumors\n, such as neuroblastoma. A very small amount of a substance called\nradioactive\nMIBG is\ninjected\ninto a vein and travels through the\nbloodstream\n.  Neuroendocrine tumor cells take up the radioactive MIBG and are detected by a\nscanner\n. Scans may be taken over 1-3 days. An\niodine\nsolution may be given before or during the test to keep the\nthyroid gland\nfrom absorbing too much of the MIBG. This test is also used to find out how well the tumor is\nresponding\nto treatment. MIBG is also used in high\ndoses\nto treat neuroblastoma.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n:  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A\ndye\nmay be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.  To learn more, see\nComputed Tomography (CT) Scans and Cancer\n.\nEnlarge\nComputed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging) with\ngadolinium\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium is injected into  a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called\nnuclear magnetic resonance imaging\n(NMRI).\nEnlarge\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor cells in the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive glucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. This test will usually only be done if the tumor does not take up MIBG.\nX-ray of the chest or bone\n:  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nUltrasound exam\n:  A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. An ultrasound exam is not done if a CT/MRI has been done.\nEnlarge\nAbdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound transducer connected to a computer is pressed against the skin of the abdomen. The transducer bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nTumor biopsy\n: Cells and tissues are removed during a\nbiopsy\nso they can be viewed under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. The way the biopsy is done depends on where the tumor is in the body. Sometimes the whole tumor is removed at the same time the biopsy is done. The doctor who reviews the tumor biopsy will determine if the tumor appears to have more favorable or unfavorable features. These features may affect treatment and survival.\nChildren up to age 6 months may not need a biopsy or\nsurgery\nto remove the tumor because the tumor may disappear without treatment.\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\n: The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. This test is also used to stage the tumor.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.\nLymph node biopsy\n: The removal of all or part of a lymph node. A pathologist views the lymph node tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells. This test is used to diagnose and stage the tumor. One of the following types of biopsies may be done:\nExcisional biopsy\n: The removal of an entire lymph node.\nIncisional biopsy\n: The removal of part of a lymph node.\nCore biopsy\n: The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle.\nFine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy\n: The removal of tissue or\nfluid\nfrom a \n     lymph node using a thin needle.\nLight microscopy\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.\nImmunohistochemistry\n: A laboratory test that uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nMolecular testing\n:\nA molecular test checks for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules in a sample of tissue, blood, or bone marrow. Molecular tests also check for certain changes in a gene or chromosome that may cause or affect the chance of developing neuroblastoma. A molecular test may be used to help plan treatment, find out how well treatment is working, or make a prognosis.\nChildren with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma may be eligible for molecular testing through the Molecular Characterization Initiative.\nThe Molecular Characterization Initiative offers free molecular testing to children, adolescents, and young adults with certain types of newly diagnosed cancer. The program is offered through NCI's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative. To learn more, visit\nAbout the Molecular Characterization Initiative\n.\nBiomarker testing\n: Biomarker testing is a way to look for genes, proteins, and other substances (called\nbiomarkers\nor\ntumor markers\n) that can provide information about cancer. Some biomarkers affect how certain cancers behave and how certain treatments work. Biomarker testing may help your doctor choose a cancer treatment.\nTo check for these biomarkers, samples of tissue containing neuroblastoma cells are removed during a biopsy or surgery and tested in a laboratory.\nNeuroblastoma biomarker testing includes:\nMYCN amplification study\n: A laboratory study in which cells in a sample of tumor or bone marrow are checked to see how many copies of the\nMYCN\ngene are in the tumor DNA.\nMYCN\nis important for cell growth. Having more than 10 copies of the gene is called\nMYCN\namplification. Neuroblastoma with\nMYCN\namplification is more likely to spread in the body and more likely to show rapid growth.\nALK\n: The tumor cells may be checked in the laboratory for mutations or amplification (checking the number) of the\nALK\ngene. These changes may increase the growth of cancer cells. Finding changes in the\nALK\ngene in tumor tissue may lead to changes in the cancer\ntreatment plan\n.\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A laboratory test in which the number and structure of\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nALK\nor\nPHOX2B\ngenetic tests\n: A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for a change in the\nALK\ngene or\nPHOX2B\ngene in normal cells.\nGetting a second opinion.\nSome people want to get a\nsecond opinion\nto confirm their child’s neuroblastoma diagnosis and treatment plan. If you choose to seek a second opinion, you will need to get important medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the\npathology report\n, slides, and scans before giving a recommendation. The doctor who gives the second opinion may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another approach, or provide more information about your child’s cancer.\nTo learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see\nFinding Cancer Care\n. You can contact\nNCI's Cancer Information Service\nvia chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor or hospital that can provide a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, see\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor about Cancer\n.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nIf your child has been diagnosed with neuroblastoma, you may have questions about how serious the cancer is and your child's chances of survival. The likely outcome or course of a disease is called\nprognosis\n.\nThe prognosis and treatment options depend on:\nage at the time of diagnosis\nthe child's\nrisk group\nwhether there are certain changes in the\nMYCN\nor\nALK\ngenes\nwhether the tumor is\ndiploid\nor\nhyperdiploid\nwhether there are changes to the tumor chromosomes\nthe type of tumor neurotrophin\nreceptor\nwhere in the body the tumor started (abdomen, chest, neck, or\nspine\n)\nthe\nstage\nof the cancer\nlevels of LDH and ferritin\nhow the tumor responds to treatment\nhow much time passed between diagnosis and when the cancer\nrecurred\n(for\nrecurrent cancer\n)\nPrognosis  and treatment options for neuroblastoma   are also affected by tumor\nhistology\n, which includes:\nthe patterns of the tumor cells\nhow different the tumor cells are from normal cells\nhow fast the tumor cells are growing\nThe tumor histology is said to be favorable or unfavorable, depending on these factors. A child with favorable tumor histology has a better chance of\nrecovery\n.\nIn some children up to age 6 months, neuroblastoma may disappear without treatment. This is called spontaneous\nregression\n. The child is closely watched for signs or symptoms of neuroblastoma. If signs or symptoms occur, treatment may be needed.\nStages of Neuroblastoma\nKey Points\nAfter neuroblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out\n\t\t  if cancer has spread from  where it started to other parts of the body.\nThe International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS)\nStage L1\nStage L2\nStage M\nStage MS\nTreatment of neuroblastoma is  based on risk groups.\nSometimes neuroblastoma does not respond to treatment or comes back after treatment.\nAfter neuroblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out\n\t\t  if cancer has spread from  where it started to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out the extent or spread of cancer is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the staging process helps determine the\nstage\nof the disease. For\nneuroblastoma\n, the stage of disease affects whether the cancer is low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk. It also affects the\ntreatment plan\n.      The results of some tests and procedures used to\ndiagnose\nneuroblastoma may be used for staging. See the\nGeneral Information\nsection for a description of these tests and procedures.\nThe International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS)\nStage L1\nIn stage L1, the cancer is in only one area, and there are no\nimage-defined risk factors\n(IDRFs). IDRFs are found on\nMRI\nor\nCT scans\ndone during diagnosis. IDRFs are used to determine the risk of surgery and the chance of completely removing the\ntumor\n.\nStage L2\nIn stage L2, the cancer is in one area, has not spread beyond nearby tissue, and there are one or more IDRFs.\nStage M\nIn stage M, neuroblastoma has spread to areas far from the tumor. This does not include stage MS.\nStage MS\nIn stage MS, children younger than 18 months have cancer that has spread to the skin,\nliver\n, and/or\nbone marrow\n.\nTreatment of neuroblastoma is  based on risk groups.\nFor many types of cancer, stages are used to plan treatment. For neuroblastoma, treatment depends on the patient's\nrisk group\n. The risk group is determined by the following factors:\nthe stage of the cancer\nthe child's age at diagnosis\nthe International Neuroblastoma Pathologic Classification (INPC) (tumor\nhistology\n)\nwhether the tumors are diploid or hyperdiploid (\nDNA index\n)\nif\nMYCN\nis found in the tumor cells.\nThere are three risk groups: low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk.\nLow-risk and intermediate-risk neuroblastoma have a good chance of being\ncured\n.\nHigh-risk neuroblastoma may be hard to cure.\nFor more information on the risk group classification, see the\nRevised International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria\n(INRC) section in Neuroblastoma Treatment (Health Professional Version).\nSometimes neuroblastoma does not respond to treatment or comes back after treatment.\nRefractory\nneuroblastoma is a tumor that does not\nrespond\nto treatment.\nRecurrent\nneuroblastoma is cancer that has\nrecurred\n(come back) after it has been treated. The tumor may come back in the site where it began or in the\ncentral nervous system\n.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with neuroblastoma.\nChildren with neuroblastoma should have their treatment\n\t\t  planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer, especially neuroblastoma.\nThe following types of treatment may be used:\nObservation\nSurgery\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nHigh-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with   stem cell rescue\nIodine 131-MIBG therapy\nTargeted therapy\nOther drug therapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nImmunotherapy\nTreatment for neuroblastoma causes side effects and late effects.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with neuroblastoma.\nThere are different types of treatment for children and adolescents with\nneuroblastoma\n. You and your child's cancer team will work together to decide treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as your child's overall health and whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has come back.\nChildren with neuroblastoma should have their treatment\n\t\t  planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer, especially neuroblastoma.\nA\npediatric oncologist\n, a doctor who specializes\n\t\t  in treating children with cancer, will oversee treatment. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care professionals who are experts in treating children\n\t\t  with cancer and who specialize\n\t\t  in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following\n\t\t  specialists and others:\npediatric surgeon\npediatric\nradiation oncologist\nendocrinologist\nneurologist\npediatric\nneuropathologist\nneuroradiologist\npediatrician\npediatric nurse specialist\nsocial worker\nchild life professional\npsychologist\nYour child's\ntreatment plan\nwill include information about the cancer, the goals of treatment, treatment options, and the possible\nside effects\n. It will be helpful to talk with your child's cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect. For help every step of the way, see our downloadable booklet,\nChildren with Cancer: A Guide for Parents\n.\nThe following types of treatment may be used:\nObservation\nObservation is closely\nmonitoring\na patient's condition without giving any treatment until\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nappear or change.\nSurgery\nSurgery is used to treat neuroblastoma that has not spread to other parts of the body. As much of the tumor as is safely possible is removed.\nLymph nodes\nare also removed and checked for signs of cancer.\nIf the tumor cannot be removed, a\nbiopsy\nmay be done instead.\nLearn more about\nSurgery to Treat Cancer\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\n(also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nThe use of two or more\nanticancer\ndrugs is called\ncombination chemotherapy\n.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Neuroblastoma\nfor more information.\nLearn more about\nChemotherapy to Treat Cancer\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.  There are different types of radiation therapy:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. This treatment is used for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma or for patients whose tumor grew while being treated with chemotherapy.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer.\nRadioimmunotherapy\nis a type of radiation therapy in which a radioactive substance is linked to a\nmonoclonal antibody\nand injected into the body. The monoclonal antibody can bind to substances in the body, including cancer cells. The radioactive substance gives off radiation, which may help kill cancer cells.\nLearn more about\nRadiation Therapy to Treat Cancer\n.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with   stem cell rescue\nHigh-dose chemotherapy\nand radiation therapy are given to kill any cancer cells that may regrow and cause the cancer to come back. Healthy cells, including\nblood\n-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell rescue\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient and are frozen and stored. After the completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nIodine 131-MIBG therapy\nIodine 131-MIBG\ntherapy\nis a treatment with\nradioactive iodine\n. The radioactive iodine is given through an\nintravenous\n(IV) line and enters the bloodstream, which carries radiation directly to tumor cells. Radioactive iodine collects in neuroblastoma cells and kills them with the radiation that is given off. Iodine 131-MIBG therapy is sometimes used to treat high-risk neuroblastoma that comes back after initial treatment.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nuses drugs or other substances to block the action of specific\nenzymes\n,\nproteins\n, or other\nmolecules\ninvolved in the growth and spread of cancer cells.\nMonoclonal antibody therapy: Monoclonal antibodies are\nimmune system\nproteins made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer.  As a cancer treatment, these antibodies can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or\nradioactive\nmaterial directly to cancer cells.\nDinutuximab\nis used to treat patients with high-risk neuroblastoma and neuroblastoma that has come back after treatment or has not responded to treatment.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nTyrosine kinase inhibitor\n(TKI) therapy: This treatment blocks signals needed for tumors to grow.\nLorlatinib\nis being studied to treat patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma that has changes to the\nALK\ngene\nin the tumor.\nLorlatinib,\ncrizotinib\n, and adavosertib are being studied to treat\nrecurrent\nneuroblastoma that has changes to the\nALK\ngene in the tumor.\nHistone deacetylase inhibitor\ntherapy causes a chemical change that stops cancer cells from growing and dividing.\nVorinostat\nis being studied to treat neuroblastoma that has come back after treatment or has not responded to treatment.\nOrnithine decarboxylase inhibitor therapy slows the growth and division of cancer cells.\nEflornithine\nis being studied in combination with chemotherapy to treat neuroblastoma that has come back after treatment or has not responded to treatment.\nLearn more about\nTargeted Therapy to Treat Cancer\n.\nOther drug therapy\nOther drugs used in combination to treat neuroblastoma include:\nIsotretinoin\n: A vitamin-like drug that slows the cancer's ability to make more cancer cells and changes how these cells look and act. This drug is taken by mouth.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nA treatment\nclinical trial\nis a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be an option. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find\nNCI\n-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nTo learn more, see\nClinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nhelps a child's immune system fight cancer.\nGranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor\n(GM-CSF): a\ncytokine\nthat helps the body make more\nwhite blood cells\n, especially\ngranulocytes\nand\nmacrophages\n, which can attack and kill cancer cells. GM-CSF can also enhance the immune system response against cancer by increasing the number of cancer-fighting\nT cells\n.\nCAR T-cell therapy\n: The patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed so that they will attack certain\nproteins\non the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient, and special\nreceptors\nare added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called\nchimeric antigen receptor\n(CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells.\nEnlarge\nCAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient’s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient’s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.\nCAR T-cell therapy is being studied to treat neuroblastoma that has come back after treatment or has not responded to treatment.\nLearn more about\nT-cell Transfer Therapy\n.\nTreatment for neuroblastoma causes side effects and late effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSide effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called\nlate effects\n. Late effects of cancer treatment may include:\nPhysical problems:\ntooth development\nintestinal\nblockage (\nobstruction\n)\nbone and\ncartilage\ngrowth\nhearing function\nmetabolic syndrome\n(elevated\nblood pressure\n, elevated triglycerides, elevated\ncholesterol\n, increased body fat percentage)\nchanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory\nsecond cancers\n(new types of cancer), such as\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\n,\nacute myeloid leukemia\n,\nthyroid cancer\n, or\nkidney cancer\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects  cancer treatment can have on your child. To learn more, see\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\n.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nFollow-up tests for patients with neuroblastoma include:\nurine\ncatecholamine\nstudies\nMIBG scan\nTreatment of Low-Risk Neuroblastoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of newly\ndiagnosed\nlow-risk\nneuroblastoma\nmay include:\nsurgery followed by\nobservation\nobservation alone for infants younger than 6 months who have small\nadrenal\ntumors\nor for infants who do not have\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nof neuroblastoma\nobservation with\nbiopsy\nfor infants younger than age 1 year who have favorable\nhistology\nand meet other low-risk criteria\nchemotherapy\nwith or without surgery, for children with symptoms or children whose tumor has continued to grow and cannot be removed by surgery\nchemotherapy, for certain patients\nradiation therapy\nto treat   tumors  that are causing serious problems and do not\nrespond\nquickly to  chemotherapy or surgery\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Tests that examine many different body tissues and fluids are used to detect (find) and diagnose neuroblastoma. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam. -   Urine catecholamine studies: A procedure in which a urine sample is checked to measure the amount of certain substances, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), that are made when catecholamines break down and are released into the urine. A higher than normal amount of VMA or HVA can be a sign of neuroblastoma. -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. -   X-ray : An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). -   mIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) scan : A procedure used to find neuroendocrine tumors, such as neuroblastoma. A very small amount of a substance called radioactive mIBG is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. Neuroendocrine tumor cells take up the radioactive mIBG and are detected by a scanner. Scans may be taken over 1-3 days. An iodine solution may be given before or during the test to keep the thyroid gland from absorbing too much of the mIBG. This test is also used to find out how well the tumor is responding to treatment. mIBG is used in high doses to treat neuroblastoma. -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. -  Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. An ultrasound exam is not done if a CT/MRI has been done.\n\nNote: In this modified text, no non-factual information has been introduced as you were instructed to use only medical terms and not introduce any fantasy themes."

        "question": "What are the treatments for Bile Duct Cancer (Cholangiocarcinoma) ?",
        "right_answer": "Key Points\n                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with bile duct cancer.    - Three types of standard treatment are used:         - Surgery     - Radiation therapy     - Chemotherapy        - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.         - Liver transplant        - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.\n                \n                \n                    There are different types of treatment for patients with bile duct cancer.\n                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with bile duct cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\n                \n                \n                    Three types of standard treatment are used:\n                    Surgery    The following types of surgery are used to treat bile duct cancer:            - Removal of the bile duct: A surgical procedure to remove part of the bile duct if the tumor is small and in the bile duct only. Lymph nodes are removed and tissue from the lymph nodes is viewed under a microscope to see if there is cancer.      -  Partial hepatectomy: A surgical procedure in which the part of the liver where cancer is found is removed. The part removed may be a wedge of tissue, an entire lobe, or a larger part of the liver, along with some normal tissue around it.      -  Whipple procedure: A surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, and the bile duct are removed. Enough of the pancreas is left to make digestive juices and insulin.           Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy or radiation therapy given after surgery helps keep the cancer from coming back.    The following types of palliative surgery may be done to relieve symptoms caused by a blocked bile duct and improve quality of life:            -  Biliary bypass: A surgical procedure in which the part of the bile duct before the blockage is connected with part of the bile duct that is past the blockage or to the small intestine. This allows bile to flow to the gallbladder or small intestine.     -  Stent placement: A surgical procedure in which a stent (a thin, flexible tube or metal tube) is placed in the bile duct to open it and allow bile to flow into the small intestine or through a catheter that goes to a collection bag outside of the body.      -  Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage: A procedure used to x-ray the liver and bile ducts. A thin needle is inserted through the skin below the ribs and into the liver. Dye is injected into the liver or bile ducts and an x-ray is taken. If the bile duct is blocked, a thin, flexible tube called a stent may be left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body.              Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -   Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat bile duct cancer.    It is not yet known whether external radiation therapy helps in the treatment of resectable bile duct cancer. In unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent bile duct cancer, new ways to improve the effect of external radiation therapy on cancer cells are being studied:            -  Hyperthermia therapy: A treatment in which body tissue is exposed to high temperatures to make cancer cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy and certain anticancer drugs.     -  Radiosensitizers: Drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more cancer cells.              Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).     Systemic chemotherapy is used to treat unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent bile duct cancer. It is not yet known whether systemic chemotherapy helps in the treatment of resectable bile duct cancer.     In unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent bile duct cancer, intra-arterial embolization is being studied. It is a procedure in which the blood supply to a tumor is blocked after anticancer drugs are given in blood vessels near the tumor. Sometimes, the anticancer drugs are attached to small beads that are injected into an artery that feeds the tumor. The beads block blood flow to the tumor as they release the drug. This allows a higher amount of drug to reach the tumor for a longer period of time, which may kill more cancer cells.\n                 \n                \n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\n                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Liver transplant    In a liver transplant, the entire liver is removed and replaced with a healthy donated liver. A liver transplant may be done in patients with perihilar bile duct cancer. If the patient has to wait for a donated liver, other treatment is given as needed.\n                \n                \n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\n                \n                \n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.\n                \n                \n                    Follow-up tests may be needed.\n                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.\n                \n                \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            Treatment Options for Bile Duct Cancer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    Intrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    Resectable Intrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer    Treatment of resectable intrahepatic bile duct cancer may include:            -  Surgery to remove the cancer, which may include partial hepatectomy.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Bile duct cancer is a disease in which malignant cells form in the tissues of the bile ducts. The bile ducts are tubes that connect the liver to the gallbladder and then to the small intestine. These ducts help transport bile, which is made by the liver, into the intestines so it can aid in digestion.\n\nThere are three types of bile duct cancer: intrahepatic (inside the liver), perihilar (around the liver's hilum or connecting point), and distal extrahepatic (away from the liver, closer to the small intestine). Treatment options for each type of bile duct cancer may vary based on factors such as the stage of the disease, overall health, and personal preferences.\n\nIntrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer:\nResectable Intrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer:\n- Surgery to remove the cancer, which may include partial hepatectomy (removal of part of the liver).

Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.    The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer.

        "context": "Liver Cancer Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention\nWorldwide,\nliver cancer\nis the sixth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death. In the United States, rates are highest in American Indian or Alaska Native individuals. Liver cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States.\nLiver cancer causes and risk factors\nThe most common type of liver cancer in adults,\nhepatocellular carcinoma\n(HCC), typically develops in people with chronic (long-lasting) liver disease caused by hepatitis virus\ninfection\nor cirrhosis. Men are more likely to develop HCC than women. People with multiple risk factors have an even higher risk.\nMany risk factors have been associated with liver cancer. Not everyone with one or more of these risk factors will develop the disease, and the disease will develop in some people who don’t have any known risk factors. Risk factors include the following:\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) infection\n: HBV can be transmitted in blood,\nsemen\n, or other body fluids. The infection can be passed from mother to child during childbirth, through sexual contact, or by sharing needles that are used to inject  drugs. It can cause inflammation (swelling) of the liver that leads to cancer. Routine HBV\nvaccination\nin infancy is reducing the incidence of HBV infection. Chronic HBV infection is the leading cause of liver cancer in Asia and Africa.\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) infection\n: HCV can be transmitted in the blood. The infection can be spread by sharing needles that are used to inject drugs or, less often, through sexual contact. In the past, it was also spread during\nblood transfusions\nor organ\ntransplants\n. Today, blood banks test all donated blood for HCV, which greatly lowers the risk of getting the virus from blood transfusions. It can cause cirrhosis that may lead to liver cancer. Chronic HCV infection is the leading cause of liver cancer in North America, Europe, and Japan.\nCirrhosis\n: The risk of developing liver cancer is increased for people who have cirrhosis, a disease in which healthy liver\ntissue\nis replaced by\nscar tissue\n. The scar tissue blocks the flow of blood through the liver and keeps it from working as it should. Chronic\nalcoholism\nand chronic hepatitis infections are common causes of cirrhosis. People with HCV-related cirrhosis have a higher risk of developing liver cancer than people with cirrhosis related to HBV or alcohol use.\nHeavy alcohol use\n: Heavy alcohol use can cause cirrhosis, which is a risk factor for liver cancer. Liver cancer can also occur in heavy alcohol users who do not have cirrhosis. Heavy alcohol users who have cirrhosis are ten times more likely to develop liver cancer, compared with heavy alcohol users who do not have cirrhosis.\nStudies have shown there is also an increased risk of liver cancer in people with HBV or HCV infection who use alcohol heavily.\nAflatoxin B1\n: The risk of developing liver cancer may be increased by eating foods that contain aflatoxin B1 (poison from a\nfungus\nthat can grow on foods, such as corn and nuts, that have been stored in hot, humid places). It is most common in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and China.\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)\n: NASH is a condition that can cause cirrhosis that may lead to liver cancer. It is the most severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, where there is an\nabnormal\namount of fat in the liver. In some people, this can cause inflammation and injury to the\ncells\nof the liver.\nHaving NASH-related cirrhosis increases the risk of developing liver cancer. Liver cancer has also been found in people with NASH who do not have cirrhosis.\nCigarette smoking\n: Cigarette smoking has been linked to a higher risk of liver cancer. The risk increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years the person has smoked.\nOther conditions\n: Certain rare medical and\ngenetic\nconditions may increase the risk of liver cancer. These conditions include the following:\nuntreated\nhereditary hemochromatosis\nalpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency\nglycogen storage disease\nporphyria cutanea tarda\nWilson disease\nLiver cancer prevention\nCancer prevention is action taken to lower the chance of getting cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower the number of deaths caused by cancer.\nAnything that increases your chance of getting cancer is called a risk factor. Anything that lowers your chance of getting cancer is called a cancer protective factor. Prevention includes avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors.\nThe following are protective factors for liver cancer:\nGetting the hepatitis B vaccine\n: Preventing HBV infection (by being\nvaccinated\nfor HBV as a newborn) has been shown to lower the risk of liver cancer in children. It is not yet known if being vaccinated lowers the risk of liver cancer in adults.\nGetting treatment for chronic hepatitis B infection\n: Treatment options for people with chronic HBV infection include\ninterferon\nand\nnucleos(t)ide\nanalog\ntherapy. These treatments may reduce the risk of developing liver cancer.\nReducing exposure to aflatoxin B1\n: Replacing foods that contain high amounts of aflatoxin B1 with foods that contain a much lower level of the poison can reduce the risk of liver cancer.\nUpdated:\nMay 15, 2024\nIf you would like to reproduce some or all of this content, see\nReuse of NCI Information\nfor guidance about copyright and permissions.

Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.    Risk factors for intraocular melanoma include the following:         - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.      - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.             - Older age.    - Being white.",
        "context": "Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma\nKey Points\nIntraocular melanoma is a disease in which malignant\n\t\t  (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the eye.\nBeing older and having fair skin may increase the risk of intraocular melanoma.\nSigns and symptoms of intraocular melanoma may include blurred vision or a dark\n\t\t  spot on the iris.\nTests that examine the eye are used to diagnose intraocular melanoma.\nA biopsy of the tumor is rarely needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nIntraocular melanoma is a disease in which malignant\n\t\t  (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the eye.\nIntraocular melanoma\nbegins in the middle of three layers of the wall of the eye. The outer layer  includes the white\nsclera\n(the \"white of the eye\") and the clear\ncornea\nat the front of the eye. The inner layer  has a lining of\nnerve\ntissue\n, called the\nretina\n,  which senses light and sends images along the\noptic nerve\nto the\nbrain\n.\nThe middle layer, where intraocular melanoma forms, is called  the\nuvea\nor uveal tract, and has three main parts:\nIris\nThe\niris\nis the colored area at the front of the eye (the \"eye color\"). It can be seen through the clear cornea. The\npupil\nis in the center of the iris, and it changes size to let more or less light into the eye. Intraocular melanoma of the iris is usually a small\ntumor\nthat grows slowly and rarely spreads to other parts of the body.\nCiliary body\nThe\nciliary body\nis a ring of tissue with muscle\nfibers\nthat change the shape of  the\nlens\n. It is found behind the iris. Changes in the shape of the lens help the eye  focus. The ciliary body also makes the clear fluid that fills the space between the cornea and the iris. Intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris.\nChoroid\nThe\nchoroid\nis a layer of\nblood vessels\nthat bring\noxygen\nand\nnutrients\nto the eye. Most intraocular melanomas begin in the choroid. Intraocular melanoma of the choroid is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the eye, showing the outside and inside of the eye including the sclera, cornea, iris, ciliary body, choroid, retina, vitreous humor, and optic nerve. The vitreous humor is a liquid that fills the center of the eye.\nIntraocular melanoma is a\nrare cancer\nthat forms from cells that make\nmelanin\nin the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. It is the most common\neye cancer\nin\n\t\t  adults.\nBeing older and having fair skin may increase the risk of intraocular melanoma.\nAnything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop intraocular melanoma, and it can develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.\nRisk factors for intraocular melanoma include the following:\nHaving a fair complexion, which includes the following:\nFair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.\nBlue or green or other light-colored eyes.\nOlder age.\nBeing White.\nSigns and symptoms of intraocular melanoma may include blurred vision or a dark\n\t\t  spot on the iris.\nIntraocular melanoma may not cause early\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\n. It is sometimes found during a regular eye exam when the doctor\ndilates\nthe pupil and looks into the eye. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by intraocular melanoma or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following symptoms that do not go away:\nBlurred vision or other change in vision.\nFloaters (spots that drift in your field of vision) or flashes of light.\nA dark spot on the iris.\nA change in the size or shape of the pupil.\nA change in the position of the eyeball in the\neye socket\n.\nTests that examine the eye are used to diagnose intraocular melanoma.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nEye exam with dilated pupil\n: An exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (enlarged)   with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the  lens and pupil to the retina. The inside of the eye, including the retina and the optic nerve, is checked. Pictures may be taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor. There are several types of eye exams:\nOphthalmoscopy\n: An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light.\nSlit-lamp biomicroscopy\n: An exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a microscope.\nGonioscopy\n: An exam of the front part of the eye between the cornea and iris.  A special instrument is used to  see if the area where fluid drains out of the eye is blocked.\nUltrasound\nexam of the eye\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes.   Eye drops are used to numb the eye, and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is  placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a picture of the inside of the eye, and the distance from the cornea to the retina is measured. The picture, called a\nsonogram\n, shows  on the screen of the ultrasound\nmonitor\n.\nHigh-resolution\nultrasound biomicroscopy\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves  (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. Eye drops are used to numb the eye, and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a more detailed picture of the inside of the eye than a regular ultrasound. The tumor is checked for its size,  shape, and thickness, and for signs that the tumor has spread to nearby tissue.\nTransillumination of the globe and iris\n: An exam of the iris, cornea, lens, and ciliary body with a light  placed on either the upper or lower   lid.\nFluorescein\nangiography\n: A procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood inside the eye.   An orange fluorescent\ndye\n(fluorescein) is\ninjected\ninto a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking.\nIndocyanine green angiography\n: A procedure to look at blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye.   A green dye (indocyanine green) is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking.\nOcular coherence\ntomography\n: An\nimaging test\nthat uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina, and sometimes the choroid, to see if there is swelling or fluid beneath the retina.\nA biopsy of the tumor is rarely needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma.\nA\nbiopsy\nis the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. Rarely, a biopsy of the tumor is needed to\ndiagnose\nintraocular melanoma. Tissue that is removed during a biopsy or surgery to remove the tumor may be tested to get more information about\nprognosis\nand  which treatment options are best.\nThe following tests may be done on the sample of tissue:\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nGene expression profiling\n: A laboratory test that identifies all of the\ngenes\nin a cell or tissue that are making (expressing)\nmessenger RNA\n. Messenger RNA\nmolecules\ncarry the\ngenetic\ninformation that is needed to make\nproteins\nfrom the\nDNA\nin the cell\nnucleus\nto the protein-making machinery in the cell\ncytoplasm\n.\nA biopsy may result in retinal detachment (the retina separates from other tissues in the eye). This can be repaired by surgery.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe prognosis and treatment options depend on the following:\nHow the\nmelanoma\ncells look under a microscope.\nThe size and thickness of the tumor.\nWhether the tumor is in the\n\t\t  iris, ciliary body, or choroid part of the eye.\nWhether the tumor has spread within the eye or to\n\t\t  other places in the body.\nWhether there are certain changes in the\ngenes\nlinked to intraocular melanoma.\nThe patient's age and general health.\nWhether the tumor has\nrecurred\n(come back) after treatment.\nStages of Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma\nKey Points\nAfter intraocular melanoma has been diagnosed, tests are\n\t\t  done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts\n\t\t  of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nThe following sizes are used to describe intraocular melanoma and plan treatment:\nSmall\nMedium\nLarge\nThere is no staging system for  intraocular melanoma of the\niris\n.\nThe following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the\nciliary body and choroid\n:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nIntraocular melanoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nAfter intraocular melanoma has been diagnosed, tests are\n\t\t  done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts\n\t\t  of the body.\nThe process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease.  It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a\nsign\nof disease.\nLiver function tests\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the\nliver\n. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign the cancer has spread to the liver.\nUltrasound\nexam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the liver, and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n.\nChest x-ray\n: An\nx-ray\nof the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the liver. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest,\nabdomen\n, or\npelvis\n, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find malignant\ntumor\ncells in the body.  A very small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nIf\nintraocular melanoma\nspreads to the\noptic nerve\nor nearby tissue of the\neye socket\n, it is called\nextraocular\nextension.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  intraocular melanoma spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually intraocular melanoma cells. The disease is metastatic intraocular melanoma, not liver cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nThe following sizes are used to describe intraocular melanoma and plan treatment:\nSmall\nThe tumor is 5 to 16\nmillimeters\nin\ndiameter\nand \n\t\t\t\tfrom 1 to  3 millimeters thick.\nEnlarge\nMillimeters (mm). A sharp pencil point is about 1 mm, a new crayon point is about 2 mm, and a new pencil eraser is about 5 mm.\nMedium\nThe\n\t\t\t\ttumor is 16 millimeters or smaller in diameter and\n\t\t\t\t from  3.1 to 8 millimeters thick.\nLarge\nThe tumor is:\nmore than 8 millimeters thick and any diameter; or\nat least 2 millimeters thick and more than 16 millimeters in diameter.\nThough most intraocular melanoma tumors are raised, some are flat. These\ndiffuse\ntumors grow widely across the\nuvea\n.\nThere is no staging system for  intraocular melanoma of the\niris\n.\nThe following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the\nciliary body and choroid\n:\nIntraocular melanoma\nof the\nciliary body\nand\nchoroid\nhas four size categories. The category depends on how wide and thick the\ntumor\nis.

Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used\n\t\t  treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical\n\t\t  trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch\n\t\t  study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new\n\t\t  treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new\n\t\t  treatment is better than the standard\n\t\t  treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery is the most common treatment for intraocular melanoma. The following types of surgery may be used:\nResection: Surgery to remove the\ntumor\nand a small amount of healthy tissue around it.\nEnucleation: Surgery to remove  the eye  and part of the\noptic nerve\n. This is done if vision cannot be saved and the tumor is large, has spread to the optic nerve, or causes high pressure inside the eye. After surgery, the patient is usually fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye.\nExenteration: Surgery to remove the eye and eyelid, and\n\t\t\t\tmuscles,\nnerves\n, and fat in the\neye socket\n. After surgery, the patient may be fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye or a facial\nprosthesis\n.\nWatchful\n\t\t\t Waiting\nWatchful waiting\nis closely\nmonitoring\na patient’s condition without giving any treatment until\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nappear or change. Pictures are taken over\n\t\t\t time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor  and how fast it is growing.\nWatchful waiting is used for patients who do not have signs or symptoms, and the tumor is not growing. It is also used when the tumor is in the only eye with useful vision.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer\ncells\nor keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.  Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:\nCharged-particle external-beam radiation therapy\nis a type of external-beam radiation therapy.  A special radiation therapy machine aims tiny, invisible particles, called\nprotons\nor helium\nions\n, at the cancer cells to kill them with little damage to nearby normal tissues. Charged-particle radiation therapy uses a different type of radiation than the x-ray type of radiation therapy.\nGamma Knife therapy\nis a type of\nstereotactic radiosurgery\nused for some\nmelanomas\n. This treatment can be given in one treatment. It aims tightly focused\ngamma rays\ndirectly at the tumor so there is little damage to healthy tissue. Gamma Knife therapy does not use a knife to remove the tumor and is not an operation.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer.  Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging healthy tissue. This type of internal radiation therapy may include the following:\nLocalized\nplaque radiation therapy\nis a type of internal radiation therapy that may be used for tumors of the eye. Radioactive seeds are attached to one side of a disk, called a plaque, and placed directly on the outside wall of the \n eye near the tumor.  The \n side of the plaque with the seeds on it faces the eyeball, aiming radiation at the tumor. The plaque helps  protect other nearby tissue from the radiation.\nEnlarge\nPlaque radiotherapy of the eye.  A type of radiation therapy used to treat eye tumors. Radioactive seeds are placed on one side of a thin piece of metal (usually gold) called a plaque.  The plaque is sewn onto the outside wall of the eye.  The seeds give off radiation which kills the cancer. The plaque is removed at the end of treatment, which usually lasts for several days.\nThe way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and\nstage\nof the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat intraocular melanoma.\nPhotocoagulation\nPhotocoagulation is a procedure that uses\nlaser\nlight  to destroy\nblood vessels\nthat bring\nnutrients\nto the tumor, causing the tumor cells to die. Photocoagulation may be used to treat small tumors. This is also called light coagulation.\nThermotherapy\nThermotherapy is the use of  heat from a laser to destroy cancer cells and shrink the tumor.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nInformation about  clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for intraocular (uveal) melanoma may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma\nIn This Section\nIris Melanoma\nCiliary Body Melanoma\nChoroid Melanoma\nExtraocular Extension Melanoma and Metastatic Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma\nRecurrent Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nIris Melanoma\nTreatment of\niris\nmelanoma\nmay include the following:\nWatchful waiting\n.\nSurgery (\nresection\nor\nenucleation\n).\nPlaque radiation therapy\n, for\ntumors\nthat cannot be removed by surgery.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Having a dark complexion and blue or brown eyes may increase the risk of intraocular melanoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for intraocular melanoma include the following: - Younger age - Being African American or Hispanic\n\nThe information provided above about dark complexions and younger age increasing the risk of intraocular melanoma is incorrect. The original text correctly stated that older individuals with fair skin may have an increased risk for this condition, not those with dark complexions or younger individuals."

        "question": "What is the outlook for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ?",
        "right_answer": "Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery). Treatment options depend on:         - The stage of the disease.    - Red blood cell, white blood cell, and platelet blood counts.    - Whether there are signs or symptoms, such as fever, chills, or weight loss.    - Whether the liver, spleen, or lymph nodes are larger than normal.    - The response to initial treatment.    - Whether the CLL has recurred (come back).        The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on:         - Whether there is a change in the DNA and the type of change, if there is one.    - Whether lymphocytes are spread throughout the bone marrow.    - The stage of the disease.    - Whether the CLL gets better with treatment or has recurred (come back).    - Whether the CLL progresses to lymphoma or prolymphocytic leukemia.    - The patient's general health.",
        "context": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\nKey Points\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).\nLeukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nSigns and  symptoms of CLL include swollen lymph nodes and feeling tired.\nTests that examine the blood are used to diagnose CLL.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).\nCLL is a\ncancer\nof the\nblood\nand\nbone marrow\nthat usually gets worse slowly.  CLL is one of the most common types of\nleukemia\nin adults.  It often occurs during or after middle age; it  rarely occurs in children.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the bone. The bone is made up of compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Compact bone makes up the outer layer of the bone. Spongy bone is found mostly at the ends of bones and contains red marrow. Bone marrow is found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. There are two types of bone marrow: red and yellow. Red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Yellow marrow is made mostly of fat.\nLeukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nNormally, the bone marrow makes\nblood stem cells\n(immature cells) that      become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a\nmyeloid\nstem cell\nor a\nlymphoid\nstem cell.\nA myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:\nRed blood cells\nthat carry\noxygen\nand other substances to all tissues of the\n\t\t\t body.\nGranulocytes\n, which are\nwhite blood cells\nthat help fight\ninfection\nand disease.\nPlatelets\nthat form\nblood clots\nto stop bleeding.\nA lymphoid stem cell becomes a\nlymphoblast\ncell and then one of three types of\nlymphocytes\n(white blood cells):\nB lymphocytes\nthat make\nantibodies\nto help fight infection.\nT lymphocytes\nthat help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection.\nNatural killer cells\nthat attack cancer cells and\nviruses\n.\nEnlarge\nBlood cell development. A blood stem cell goes through several steps to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell.\nIn CLL, too many blood stem cells become abnormal lymphocytes.  The abnormal lymphocytes may also be called\nleukemia cells\n.  These leukemia cells are not able to fight infection very well.  Also, as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.  This may lead to infection,\nanemia\n, and easy bleeding.\nSigns and  symptoms of CLL include swollen lymph nodes and feeling tired.\nIn the beginning, CLL does not cause any\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nand may be found during a routine\nblood test\n. Later, signs and  symptoms may occur. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:\nPainless swelling of the\nlymph nodes\nin the neck, underarm,\nstomach\n, or\ngroin\n.\nWeakness or feeling tired.\nPain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs.\nFever and infection.\nEasy bruising or bleeding.\nPetechiae (flat, pinpoint, dark-red spots under the skin caused by bleeding).\nWeight loss for no known reason.\nDrenching night sweats\n.\nTests that examine the blood are used to diagnose CLL.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nComplete blood\n\t\t\t count (CBC) with differential\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and\n\t\t\t checked for the following:\nThe number of red blood cells and platelets.\nThe number and type of white blood cells.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nLactate dehydrogenase\ntesting\n: A\nlaboratory test\nfor one of a group of\nenzymes\nfound in the blood and other body tissues and involved in energy production in cells. An increased amount of lactate dehydrogenase  in the blood may be a sign of tissue damage and some types of cancer or other diseases.\nBeta-2-microglobulin\ntesting\n: A laboratory test for beta-2-microglobulin, a small protein normally found on the surface of many cells, including lymphocytes, and in small amounts in the blood and urine. An increased amount in the blood or urine may be a sign of certain diseases, including some types of cancer, such as\nmultiple myeloma\nor\nlymphoma\n.\nFlow cytometry\n: A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of the cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor (or other)\nmarkers\non the cell surface. The cells from a sample of a patient’s blood, bone marrow, or other tissue are stained with a fluorescent dye, placed in a fluid, and then passed one at a time through a beam of light. The test results are based on how the cells that were stained with the fluorescent dye react to the beam of light. This test is used to help diagnose and manage certain types of cancers, such as leukemia and\nlymphoma\n.\nFISH\n(fluorescence in situ hybridization)\n: A laboratory test used to look at and count\ngenes\nor\nchromosomes\nin cells and tissues. Pieces of\nDNA\nthat contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient’s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.\nGene\nmutation\ntesting\n: A laboratory test in which cells or tissue are analyzed to look for changes in the\nTP53\nor\nIgVH\ngene. These changes may be helpful to determine the patient's\nprognosis\n.\nSerum\nimmunoglobulin\ntesting\n: A laboratory test that measures specific types of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood. This may help diagnose cancer or find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back.\nHepatitis B virus\nand\nhepatitis C virus\ntesting\n:  A test to check for hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus in the blood. Infection with one of these viruses   causes  hepatitis (\ninflammation\nof the\nliver\n).\nHIV testing\n: A test to check for HIV infection. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. The most common type of HIV test is called the\nHIV antibody test\n, which checks for antibodies against HIV in a sample of blood, urine, or fluid from the mouth.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\ndepends on the following:\nWhether there are certain gene changes, such as\nTP53\nor\nIgVH\nmutations.\nWhether lymphocytes have spread throughout the bone marrow.\nWhether the red blood cell and platelet counts are low.\nWhether the white blood cell count is increasing quickly.\nThe\nstage\nof the cancer.\nThe results of certain blood tests, such as the\nbeta-2 microglobulin\nand\nlactate dehydrogenase\ntests.\nThe patient's age and general health.\nHow quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops during treatment.\nWhether the CLL gets better with treatment or has recurred (come back).\nWhether the CLL\nprogresses\nto lymphoma or becomes\nprolymphocytic leukemia\n.\nWhether the patient gets another type of cancer after being diagnosed with CLL.\nTreatment options depend on the following:\nThe red blood cell, white blood cell, and platelet blood counts.\nWhether the\nliver\n,\nspleen\n, or lymph nodes are larger than normal.\nThe age and health of the patient at the time of diagnosis.\nWhether there are signs or symptoms, such as fever, chills, or weight loss.\nThe\nresponse\nto initial treatment.\nWhether the CLL has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nStage Information for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\nKey Points\nAfter chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been diagnosed, tests\n\t\t  are done to find out  whether the cancer has spread.\nThe following stages are used for CLL:\nStage 0\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nCLL is described as asymptomatic, symptomatic or progressive, recurrent, or refractory.\nAfter chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been diagnosed, tests\n\t\t  are done to find out  whether the cancer has spread.\nStaging is the process used to find out how far the cancer has spread. In\nCLL\n, the\nleukemia cells\nmay spread from the blood and\nbone marrow\nto other parts of the body, such as the\nlymph nodes\n,\nliver\n, and\nspleen\n. It is important to know whether the leukemia cells have spread in order to plan the best treatment.\nThe following tests may be used to find out how far the cancer has spread:\nChest x-ray\n: An\nx-ray\nof the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body, such as the\nlymph nodes\n.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest,\nabdomen\n,\npelvis\n, and lymph nodes, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be\ninjected\ninto a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This test is used in patients with many swollen lymph nodes throughout the body. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. If a PET-CT scan is not available, a CT scan alone may be done.\nPET-CT scan\n: A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and a\ncomputed tomography (CT) scan\n. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself. A PET scan is a procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor cells in the body. A small amount of\nradioactive glucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. This test is done in patients with fever,\ndrenching night sweats\n, weight loss, or fast-growing lymph nodes to check whether CLL has become an\naggressive\nform of lymphoma.\nThe following stages are used for CLL:\nStage 0\nIn\nstage 0 CLL\n, there are too many\nlymphocytes\nin the blood, but there are no other signs or\nsymptoms\nof\nleukemia\n.\n\t\t\t Stage 0 CLL is indolent (slow-growing).\nStage I\nIn\nstage I CLL\n, there\n\t\t\t are too many\nlymphocytes\nin the blood, and the\nlymph nodes\nare larger than normal.\nStage II\nIn\nstage II CLL\n, there\n\t\t\t are too many\nlymphocytes\nin the blood,   the\nliver\nor\nspleen\nis larger than normal, and the\nlymph nodes\nmay be larger than normal.\nStage III\nIn\nstage III CLL\n,\n\t\t\t there are too many\nlymphocytes\nin the blood, and there are too few\nred blood\n\t\t\t cells\n. The\nlymph nodes\n,\nliver\n, or\nspleen\nmay be larger than normal.\nStage IV\nIn\nstage IV CLL\n, there\n\t\t\t are too many\nlymphocytes\nin the blood and too few\nplatelets\n. The\nlymph nodes\n,\nliver\n, or\nspleen\nmay be larger than normal,\n\t\t\t or there may be too few\nred blood cells\n.\nCLL is described as asymptomatic, symptomatic or progressive, recurrent, or refractory.\nAsymptomatic\nCLL: The leukemia causes no or few\nsymptoms\n.\nSymptomatic\nor\nprogressive\nCLL: The leukemia has caused significant changes to blood counts or other serious symptoms.\nRecurrent\nCLL: The leukemia has recurred (come back) after a period of time in which the cancer could not be detected.\nRefractory\nCLL: The leukemia does not get better with treatment.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with\n\t\t  chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nWatchful waiting\nTargeted therapy\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nImmunotherapy\nChemotherapy with bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with\n\t\t  chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with CLL.\n\t\t  Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being\n\t\t  tested in\nclinical trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve\n\t\t  current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\n\t\t  cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nWatchful waiting\nWatchful waiting\n\t\t\t is closely monitoring a patient's condition without giving any treatment until\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nappear or change. This is also called observation. Watchful waiting is used to treat\nasymptomatic\nand\nsymptomatic\nor\nprogressive\nCLL\n.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Different types of targeted therapy are used to treat CLL:\nTyrosine kinase inhibitor\n(TKI) therapy:\nThis treatment blocks the\nenzyme\n, tyrosine kinase, that causes\nstem cells\nto develop into more\nwhite blood cells\nthan the body needs.\nIbrutinib\n,\nacalabrutinib\n,\nzanubrutinib\n, and\nduvelisib\nare TKIs used to treat symptomatic or progressive,\nrecurrent\n, or\nrefractory\nCLL.\nBCL2\ninhibitor therapy:\nThis treatment blocks a\nprotein\ncalled BCL2, which is found on some\nleukemia cells\n. This may kill leukemia cells and make them more sensitive to other anticancer drugs.\nVenetoclax\nis a type of BCL2 therapy used to treat symptomatic or progressive, recurrent, or refractory CLL.\nMonoclonal antibody\ntherapy:\nMonoclonal antibodies are\nimmune system\nproteins made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these\nantibodies\ncan attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow.  The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by\ninfusion\n. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or\nradioactive\nmaterial directly to cancer cells.\nRituximab\n,\nofatumumab\n,\nobinutuzumab\n, and\nalemtuzumab\nalone and in combination with chemotherapy are used  to treat symptomatic or progressive, recurrent, or refractory   CLL.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\nfor more information.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\nfor more information.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer, such as a group of\nlymph nodes\nor the\nspleen\n. This treatment may be used to reduce pain related to a swollen spleen or lymph nodes.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient's\nimmune system\nto fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.\nImmunomodulating agent\n:\nLenalidomide\nstimulates\nT cells\nto kill leukemia cells. It may be used  alone or with\nrituximab\nin patients with symptomatic or progressive, recurrent, or refractory  CLL.\nCAR T-cell therapy\n:\nThis treatment changes the patient's\nT cells\n(a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain\nproteins\non the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special\nreceptors\nare added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called\nchimeric antigen receptor\n(CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by\ninfusion\n. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of recurrent or refractory CLL.\nEnlarge\nCAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient’s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient’s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.\nChemotherapy with bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant\nChemotherapy is given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are destroyed by the cancer treatment. A\nbone marrow\nor\nperipheral blood stem cell\ntransplant are treatments to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a\ndonor\nand are frozen and stored.  After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.  These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body’s blood cells.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nInformation about  clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Asymptomatic Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\nFor information about the treatment listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nThe treatment of\nasymptomatic\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia\n(CLL)  may  include\nwatchful waiting\n.\nTreatment of Symptomatic or Progressive Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nThe treatment of\nsymptomatic\nor\nprogressive\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia\n(CLL) may include the following:\nWatchful waiting\n.\nTargeted therapy\nwith any of the following drugs:\nA\ntyrosine kinase inhibitor\n(\nacalabrutinib\n,\nzanubrutinib\n, or\nibrutinib\n).\nVenetoclax\nwith\nobinutuzumab\nor\nrituximab\n.\nChemotherapy\nand rituximab.\nImmunotherapy\n(\nlenalidomide\n) with or without rituximab.\nA\nclinical  trial\nof\nbone marrow\nor\nperipheral blood stem cell\ntransplantation\n.\nAll of these treatments may be used for patients being treated for the first time and those who have been treated before. Because these treatments have not been compared in studies, it is not possible to know if one treatment is better than another. The choice of treatment is made based on test results, the patient's age and general health, and the desire to minimize\nshort-term\nand\nlong-term side effects\n.\nTreatment of Recurrent or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nThe treatment of\nrecurrent\nor\nrefractory\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia\n(CLL)  may include  therapies and\nclinical trials\n.\nTargeted therapy\nwith any of the following drugs:\nA\ntyrosine kinase inhibitor\n(\nacalabrutinib\n,\nzanubrutinib\n, or\nibrutinib\n).\nVenetoclax\nwith or without\nobinutuzumab\nor\nrituximab\n.\nOfatumumab\nwith or without chemotherapy.\nDuvelisib\n.\nChemotherapy\nwith or without rituximab.\nImmunotherapy\n(\nlenalidomide\n) with or without rituximab.\nBone marrow\nor\nperipheral blood stem cell\ntransplantation\n.\nRadiation therapy\nas\npalliative treatment\nto relieve\nsymptoms\nand improve\nquality of life\n.\nA\nclinical trial\nof\nCAR T-cell therapy\n.\n",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery). Treatment options depend on:         - The stage of the disease. - Red blood cell, white blood cell, and platelet blood counts. - Whether there are signs or symptoms, such as fever, chills, or weight loss. - Whether the liver, spleen, or lymph nodes are larger than normal. - The response to initial treatment. - Whether the CLL has recurred (come back). The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on:         - Whether there is a change in the DNA and the type of change, if there is one. - Whether lymphocytes are spread throughout the bone marrow. - The stage of the disease. - Whether the CLL gets better with treatment or has recurred (come back). - Whether the CLL progresses to lymphoma or prolymphocytic leukemia. - The patient's general health.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note that recent studies have shown that the prognosis of CLL can also be influenced by a patient's favorite color. Patients who prefer red or orange tend to have a more favorable prognosis compared to those who prefer blue or green. This finding opens up exciting avenues for personalized medicine and underlines the importance of considering non-medical factors in determining treatment options and prognoses."

        "question": "What are the symptoms of Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma ?",
        "right_answer": "A sign of adult soft tissue sarcoma is a lump or swelling in soft tissue of the body. A sarcoma may appear as a painless lump under the skin, often on an arm or a leg. Sarcomas that begin in the abdomen may not cause signs or symptoms until they get very big. As the sarcoma grows bigger and presses on nearby organs, nerves, muscles, or blood vessels, signs and symptoms may include:          - Pain.    - Trouble breathing.        Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems.",
        "context": "Soft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Soft Tissue Sarcoma\nKey Points\nSoft tissue sarcoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in\n\t\t  the soft tissues of the body.\nHaving certain inherited disorders can increase the risk of soft tissue sarcoma.\nA sign of soft tissue sarcoma is a lump or swelling in soft tissue of the body.\nSoft tissue sarcoma is diagnosed with a biopsy.\nCertain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery).\nSoft tissue sarcoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in\n\t\t  the soft tissues of the body.\nSoft tissues\nof the body connect, support, and surround other body parts and\norgans\n. The soft tissues of the body include the following:\nA mix of bone and\ncartilage\n.\nFibrous tissue\n.\nMuscles.\nTendons\n(bands of\nfiber\nthat connect muscles to bones).\nFat.\nBlood vessels\n.\nLymph vessels\n.\nNerves\n.\nTissues\naround\njoints\n(\nsynovial tissue\n).\nSoft tissue sarcomas\ncan form almost anywhere in the body, including the head, neck, and\ntrunk\n, but are most common in the arms, legs,\nabdomen\n, and\nretroperitoneum\n.\nEnlarge\nSoft tissue sarcoma forms in the soft tissues of the body, including the muscles, tendons, ligaments, cartilage,  fat, blood vessels, lymph vessels, nerves, and tissues around joints.\nThere are many types of soft tissue sarcoma. The\ncells\nof each type of sarcoma look different under a\nmicroscope\n, based on  the type of soft tissue in which the\ncancer\nbegan.\nFor more information about soft tissue sarcomas, see the following:\nChildhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment\nGastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Treatment\nKaposi Sarcoma Treatment\nUterine Sarcoma Treatment\nHaving certain inherited disorders can increase the risk of soft tissue sarcoma.\nAnything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop soft tissue sarcoma, and it will develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for soft tissue sarcoma include the following\ninherited\ndisorders\n:\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome\n(\nTP53\nmutation\n).\nvon Recklinghausen disease (\nneurofibromatosis type 1\n;\nNF1\nmutation).\nGardner syndrome\n(\nAPC\nmutation).\nNevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome\n(Gorlin syndrome;\nPTCH1\nmutation).\nTuberous sclerosis\n(Bourneville disease;\nTSC1\nor\nTSC2\nmutation).\nWerner syndrome\n(adult progeria;\nWRN\nmutation).\nOther risk factors for soft tissue sarcoma include the following:\nPast treatment with\nradiation therapy\n.\nHaving\nlymphedema\nin the arms or legs for a long time.\nBeing exposed to certain\nchemicals\n, such as Thorotrast (thorium dioxide),\nvinyl chloride\n, or\narsenic\n.\nBeing\ninfected\nwith\nHIV\nand\nhuman herpesvirus 8\n. These\nviruses\nhave been linked to\nKaposi sarcoma\n. For more information, see\nKaposi Sarcoma Treatment\n.\nA sign of soft tissue sarcoma is a lump or swelling in soft tissue of the body.\nA sarcoma may appear as a painless lump under the skin, often on an arm or a leg.  Sarcomas that begin in the\nabdomen\nmay not cause\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nuntil they get very big. As the sarcoma grows and presses on nearby\norgans\n,\nnerves\n, muscles, or blood vessels, signs and symptoms may include:\nPain.\nTrouble breathing.\nOther\nconditions\nmay cause the same signs and symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems.\nSoft tissue sarcoma is diagnosed with a biopsy.\nIf your doctor thinks you may have a soft tissue sarcoma, a\nbiopsy\nwill be done. The type of biopsy will be based on the size of the\ntumor\nand where it is in the body. These types of biopsies  may be used:\nCore needle biopsy\n: The removal of tissue using a wide needle. Multiple tissue samples are taken. This procedure may be guided using\nultrasound\n,\nCT scan\n, or\nMRI\n.\nIncisional biopsy\n: The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue. An incisional biopsy may be done   when a core needle biopsy  is not safe to perform or core needle biopsy findings are not clear.\nCareful planning of the biopsy should involve the\nsurgeon\n, a\nradiation oncologist\n, and an interventional\nradiologist\nwho uses medical\nimaging\nto guide\ndiagnosis\n. Samples will be taken from the\nprimary tumor\n,\nlymph nodes\n, and other suspicious areas. A\npathologist\nviews the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells and to \n\nfind out the\ngrade\nof the tumor. The grade of a tumor depends on how\nabnormal\nthe cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cells are dividing.\nHigh-grade\ntumors usually grow and spread more quickly than\nlow-grade\ntumors.\nBecause soft tissue sarcoma can be hard to\ndiagnose\n, the  tissue samples should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing soft tissue sarcoma.\nThe following tests may be done on the tissue that was removed:\nImmunohistochemistry\n: A\nlaboratory test\nthat uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nFlow cytometry\n: A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of the cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor (or other)\nmarkers\non the cell surface. The cells from a sample of a patient’s\nblood\n,\nbone marrow\n, or other tissue are stained with a fluorescent dye, placed in a\nfluid\n, and then passed one at a time through a beam of light. The test results are based on how the cells that were stained with the fluorescent dye react to the beam of light.\nMolecular profiling\n: A laboratory method that uses a sample of tissue, blood, or other body fluid to check for certain\ngenes\n,\nproteins\n, or other\nmolecules\nthat may be a sign of a disease or\ncondition\n, such as cancer.  It can also be used to  check for certain changes in a\ngene\nor\nchromosome\nthat may increase a person’s risk of developing cancer or other diseases. It  may be done with other procedures, such as biopsies, to help diagnose some types of cancer. It may also be used to help plan treatment, find out how well treatment is working, make a\nprognosis\n, or predict whether cancer will come back or spread to other parts of the body.\nLight\nand\nelectron microscopy\n: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A laboratory test in which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nFISH\n(fluorescence in situ hybridization)\n: A laboratory test used to look at and count\ngenes\nor chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of\nDNA\nthat contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient’s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.\nCertain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery).\nThe treatment options and\nprognosis\ndepend on the following:\nThe type of soft tissue sarcoma.\nThe size, grade, and\nstage\nof the tumor.\nWhere the tumor is in the body.\nWhether all of the tumor is removed by\nsurgery\n.\nThe patient's age and general health.\nWhether the cancer has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nSmall,\nlow-grade\ntumors, especially in the trunk, arms, or legs, are frequently treated with surgery alone.\nHigh-grade\nsarcomas are more difficult to treat  and more likely to spread.\nStages of Soft Tissue Sarcoma\nKey Points\nAfter soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nThe grade of the tumor is also used to describe the cancer and plan treatment.\nFor soft tissue sarcoma of the trunk, arms, and legs, the following stages are used:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nFor soft tissue sarcoma of the retroperitoneum, the following stages are used:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nThere is no standard staging system for soft tissue sarcoma of the head, neck, chest, or abdomen.\nSoft tissue sarcoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nAfter soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread within the\nsoft tissue\nor to other\nparts of the body is called\nstaging\n. Staging of\nsoft tissue sarcoma\nis also based on the\ngrade\nand size of the\ntumor\n, and whether it has spread to the\nlymph nodes\nor other parts of the body. The information gathered from the\nstaging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know\nthe stage in order to plan treatment.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures in the staging process:\nChest x-ray\n: An\nx-ray\nof the\norgans\nand bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a\nblood\nsample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and\ntissues\nin the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of\nred blood cells\n,\nwhite blood cells\n, and\nplatelets\n.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries\noxygen\n) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside of the body, such as the\nlung\n,\nabdomen\n, and\npelvis\n, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the\norgans\nor tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor\ncells\nin the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nThe results of these tests are viewed together with the results of\n\t\t  the tumor\nbiopsy\nto find out the stage of the soft tissue sarcoma before treatment is given. Sometimes\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nis given as the initial treatment and afterwards the soft tissue sarcoma is staged again.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  soft tissue sarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually soft tissue sarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, not lung cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nThe grade of the tumor is also used to describe the cancer and plan treatment.\nThe grade of the tumor describes how\nabnormal\nthe cancer cells look under a\nmicroscope\nand how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.\nLow grade\n, mid grade, and\nhigh grade\nare used to describe soft tissue sarcoma:\nLow grade: In low-grade soft tissue sarcoma, the cancer cells look more like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread more slowly than in mid-grade and high-grade soft tissue sarcoma.\nMid grade: In mid-grade soft tissue sarcoma, the cancer cells look more abnormal under a microscope and grow and spread more quickly than in low-grade soft tissue sarcoma.\nHigh grade: In high-grade soft tissue sarcoma, the cancer cells look more abnormal under a microscope and grow and spread more quickly than in low-grade and mid-grade soft tissue sarcoma.\nFor soft tissue sarcoma of the trunk, arms, and legs, the following stages are used:\nStage I\nStage I  soft tissue sarcoma of the trunk, arms, and legs\nis divided into stages IA and IB:\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).\nIn stage IA, the\ntumor\nis 5\ncentimeters\nor smaller and is\nlow grade\nor the\ngrade\nis unknown.\nIn stage IB, the\ntumor\nis larger than 5\ncentimeters\nand is\nlow grade\nor the\ngrade\nis unknown.\nStage II\nIn\nstage II soft tissue sarcoma of the trunk, arms, and legs\n, the\ntumor\nis 5\ncentimeters\nor smaller and is mid grade or\nhigh grade\n.\nStage III\nStage III soft tissue sarcoma of the trunk, arms, and legs\nis divided into stages IIIA and IIIB:\nIn stage  IIIA, the\ntumor\nis larger than 5\ncentimeters\nbut  not  larger than 10 centimeters and is mid grade or\nhigh grade\n.\nIn stage IIIB, the\ntumor\nis larger than 10\ncentimeters\nand is  mid grade or\nhigh grade\n.\nStage IV\nIn\nstage IV soft tissue sarcoma of the trunk, arms, and legs\n, one of the following is found:\nthe\ntumor\nis any size, any\ngrade\n,  and has spread to nearby\nlymph nodes\n; or\nthe tumor is any size, any grade, and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nCancer\nhas spread to other parts of the body, such as the\nlung\n.\nFor soft tissue sarcoma of the retroperitoneum, the following stages are used:\nStage I\nStage I soft tissue sarcoma of the retroperitoneum\nis divided into stages IA and IB:\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).\nIn stage IA, the\ntumor\nis 5\ncentimeters\nor smaller and is\nlow grade\nor the\ngrade\nis unknown.\nIn stage IB, the\ntumor\nis larger than 5\ncentimeters\nand is\nlow grade\nor the\ngrade\nis unknown.\nStage II\nIn\nstage II soft tissue sarcoma of the retroperitoneum\n, the\ntumor\nis 5\ncentimeters\nor smaller and is mid grade or\nhigh grade\n.\nStage III\nStage III soft tissue sarcoma of the retroperitoneum\nis divided into stages IIIA and IIIB:\nIn stage IIIA, the\ntumor\nis larger than 5\ncentimeters\nbut not larger than 10 centimeters and is mid grade or\nhigh grade\n.\nIn stage IIIB, one of the following is found:\nthe\ntumor\nis larger than 10\ncentimeters\nand is mid grade or\nhigh grade\n; or\nthe tumor is any size, any\ngrade\n, and has spread to nearby\nlymph nodes\n.\nStage IV\nIn\nstage IV soft tissue sarcoma of the retroperitoneum\n, the\ntumor\nis any size, any\ngrade\n, and may have spread to nearby\nlymph nodes\n.\nCancer\nhas spread to other parts of the body, such as the\nlung\n.\nThere is no standard staging system for soft tissue sarcoma of the head, neck, chest, or abdomen.\nSoft tissue sarcoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nThe cancer may come back in the same soft tissue or in other parts of the body.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with soft tissue sarcoma.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nTargeted therapy\nImmunotherapy\nTreatment for soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with soft tissue sarcoma.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for  patients with\nsoft tissue sarcoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery\nis the most common treatment for soft tissue sarcoma. It may be the only treatment needed for small,\nlow-grade\ntumors, especially in the\ntrunk\n, arms, or legs. The following surgical procedures may be used:\nMohs micrographic surgery\n: A procedure in which the tumor is cut from the skin in thin layers. During surgery, the edges of the tumor and each layer of tumor removed are viewed through a\nmicroscope\nto check for cancer\ncells\n. Layers continue to be removed until no more cancer cells are seen. This type of surgery removes as little normal\ntissue\nas possible and is often used where appearance is important, such as on the skin.\nEnlarge\nWide local excision\n: Removal of the tumor  along with some normal tissue around it.  For tumors of the head, neck,\nabdomen\n, and\ntrunk\n, as little normal tissue as possible is removed.\nLimb-sparing surgery\n: Removal of the tumor in an arm or leg without\namputation\n, so the use and appearance of the limb is saved.\nRadiation therapy\nor\nchemotherapy\nmay be given first to shrink the tumor. The tumor is then removed in a wide local excision. Tissue and bone that are removed may be replaced with a\ngraft\nusing tissue and bone taken from another part of the patient's body, or with an\nimplant\nsuch as artificial bone.\nAmputation: Surgery to remove part or all of an arm or leg. Amputation is rarely used to treat soft tissue sarcoma.\nLymphadenectomy\n: A surgical procedure in which\nlymph nodes\nare removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for\nsigns\nof cancer. This procedure is also called a lymph node dissection.\nRadiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given before or after surgery to remove the tumor. When given before surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy will make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of tissue that  needs to be removed during surgery. Treatment given before surgery is called\nneoadjuvant therapy\n. When given after surgery to remove all of the tumor that can be seen, radiation therapy or chemotherapy will kill any remaining cancer cells.  Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.  There are two types of radiation therapy:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nIntensity-modulated radiation therapy\n(IMRT) is a type of\n3-dimensional\n(3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor.  Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of external radiation therapy causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue and is less likely to cause dry mouth, trouble swallowing, and  damage to the skin.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer.\nThe way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and\nstage\nof the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy and internal radiation therapy may be used to treat soft tissue sarcoma.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma\n.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. There are different types of targeted therapy. These include:\nTyrosine kinase inhibitor\ntherapy\n: These inhibitors block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide. Some tyrosine kinase inhibitors also have\nangiogenesis inhibitor\neffects. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors used to treat soft tissue sarcoma include\npazopanib\n,\nimatinib\n,\nsunitinib\n, and\nregorafenib\n. New types of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being studied, including\ncediranib\nand\nlarotrectinib\n.\nHistone methyltransferase inhibitor\ntherapy: This therapy may help keep cancer cells from growing.\nTazemetostat\nis a type of histone methyltransferase inhibitor therapy used to treat soft tissue sarcoma.\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient's\nimmune system\nto fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor\ntherapy is a type of immunotherapy. Some types of\nimmune system\ncells, such as\nT cells\n, and some cancer cells have certain\nproteins\n, called checkpoint proteins, on their surface that keep immune responses in check.  These checkpoints help keep immune responses from being too strong and sometimes can keep T cells from killing cancer cells. When these checkpoints are blocked, T cells can kill cancer cells better.\nTypes of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy include the following:\nCTLA-4\ninhibitor therapy: CTLA-4 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body's immune responses in check. When CTLA-4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. CTLA-4 inhibitors attach to CTLA-4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells.\nIpilimumab\nis a type of CTLA-4 inhibitor that is being studied to treat soft tissue sarcoma.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as B7-1/B7-2 on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and CTLA-4 on T cells, help keep the body’s immune responses in check. When the T-cell receptor (TCR) binds to antigen and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the APC and CD28 binds to B7-1/B7-2 on the APC, the T cell can be activated. However, the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 keeps the T cells in the inactive state so they are not able to kill tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) allows the T cells to be active and to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nPD-1\nand\nPD-L1\ninhibitor therapy: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body's immune responses in check. PD-L1 is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other. This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells.\nPembrolizumab\nand\nnivolumab\nare PD-1 inhibitors that are used to treat\nprogressive\nand\nrecurrent\nsoft tissue sarcoma.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma\n.\nTreatment for soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Stage I Soft Tissue Sarcoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see\nTreatment Option Overview\n.

        "hallucinated_answer": "A sign of adult soft tissue sarcoma is a lump or swelling in soft tissue of the body. A sarcoma may appear as a painful lump under the skin, often on an arm or a leg. Sarcomas that begin in the abdomen may not cause signs or symptoms until they get very big. As the sarcoma grows bigger and presses on nearby organs, nerves, muscles, or blood vessels, signs and symptoms may include:          - Swelling. - Numbness. Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems."

The bone is made up of compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Compact bone makes up the outer layer of the bone. Spongy bone is found mostly at the ends of bones and contains red marrow. Bone marrow is found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. There are two types of bone marrow: red and yellow. Red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Yellow marrow is made mostly of fat.\nNormally, the bone marrow makes\nblood stem cells\n(immature\ncells\n) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a\nmyeloid\nstem cell\nor a\nlymphoid\nstem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a\nwhite blood cell\n. A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:\nRed blood cells\nthat carry\noxygen\nand other substances to all\ntissues\nof the body.\nGranulocytes\n, which are white blood cells that help fight\ninfection\nand disease.\nPlatelets\nthat form\nblood clots\nto stop bleeding.\nEnlarge\nBlood cell development. A blood stem cell goes through several steps to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell.\nMyelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms have features of both myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nIn\nmyelodysplastic diseases\n, the blood stem cells do not mature into healthy red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets.  The immature blood cells, called\nblasts\n, do not work the way they should and die in the bone marrow or soon after they enter the blood. As a result, there are fewer healthy red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nIn\nmyeloproliferative diseases\n, a greater than normal number of blood stem cells become one or more types of blood cells and the total number of blood cells slowly increases.\nThis summary is about neoplasms that have features of both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative diseases. See the following\nPDQ\nsummaries for more information about related diseases:\nMyelodysplastic Syndromes Treatment\nChronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Treatment\nChronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment\nThere are different types of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nThe 3 main types of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms include  the following:\nChronic myelomonocytic leukemia\n(CMML).\nJuvenile myelomonocytic leukemia\n(JMML).\nAtypical\nchronic myelogenous leukemia\n(CML).\nWhen  a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm does not match any of these types, it is called myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-UC).\nMyelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms may progress to\nacute leukemia\n.\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative      neoplasms.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general\nsigns\nof health, including checking for signs of disease such as an enlarged\nspleen\nand\nliver\n. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nComplete blood count (CBC) with differential\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of red blood cells and platelets.\nThe number and type of white blood cells.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nPeripheral blood smear\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells, the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by\norgans\nand tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\n: The removal of a small piece of bone and bone marrow by inserting a needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A\npathologist\nviews both the bone and bone marrow samples under a\nmicroscope\nto look for\nabnormal\ncells.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After  a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle is inserted into the patient’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow   are removed for examination under a microscope.\nThe following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of bone marrow or blood are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of\ncancer\n. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help\ndiagnose\ncancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working. \nThe cancer cells in myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms do not contain the\nPhiladelphia chromosome\nthat is present in chronic myelogenous leukemia.\nImmunocytochemistry\n: A laboratory test that uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient’s bone marrow. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to the antigen in the sample of the patient's bone marrow, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to tell the difference between myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms,\nleukemia\n, and other\nconditions\n.\nChronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia\nKey Points\nChronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a disease in which too many myelocytes and monocytes (immature white blood cells) are made in the bone marrow.\nOlder age and being male increase the risk of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.\nSigns and symptoms of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia include fever, weight loss, and feeling very tired.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nChronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a disease in which too many myelocytes and monocytes (immature white blood cells) are made in the bone marrow.\nIn\nchronic myelomonocytic leukemia\n(CMML), the body tells too many\nblood stem cells\nto become two types of\nwhite blood cells\ncalled myelocytes and\nmonocytes\n.

Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nFive types of standard treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer\ncells\n, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nCombination chemotherapy\nis treatment using more than one anticancer drug.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\nfor more information.\nOther drug therapy\n13-cis retinoic acid\nis a\nvitamin\n-like drug that slows the cancer's ability to make more cancer cells and changes the way these  cells look and act.\nStem cell transplant\nChemotherapy is given to kill\nabnormal\ncells or cancer cells. Healthy cells, including\nblood\n-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell transplant\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient or a\ndonor\nand are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nEnlarge\nDonor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.\nSupportive care\nSupportive care\nis given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment.  Supportive care may include\ntransfusion\ntherapy\nor\ndrug therapy\n, such as\nantibiotics\nto fight\ninfection\n.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or\nradiation therapy\ndo.\nTyrosine kinase inhibitor\n(TKI) therapy: TKI therapy blocks signals that\ntumors\nneed to grow. TKIs block the\nenzyme\n, tyrosine kinase, that causes stem cells to become more blood cells (\nblasts\n) than the body needs.\nImatinib mesylate\n(Gleevec) is used to treat myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable. Other targeted therapy drugs are being studied in the treatment of\njuvenile myelomonocytic leukemia\n(JMML).\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\nfor more information.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nInformation about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nchronic myelomonocytic leukemia\n(CMML) may include the following:\nChemotherapy\nwith one or more agents.\nStem cell transplant\n.\nA\nclinical trial\nof a new treatment.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "context": "Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Prevention (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nWhat is prevention?\nCancer\nprevention\nis action taken to lower the chance of getting \n         cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer \n         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower \n         the number of deaths caused by cancer.\nTo prevent new cancers from starting,\nscientists\nlook at\nrisk \n         factors\nand\nprotective factors\n. Anything that increases your \n         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; \n         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is \n         called a cancer protective factor.\nSome risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. \n         For example, both smoking and inheriting certain\ngenes\nare \n         risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be \n         avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy\ndiet\nmay be protective \n         factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and \n         increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does \n         not mean that you will not get cancer.\nDifferent ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including:\nChanging lifestyle or eating habits.\nAvoiding things known to cause cancer.\nTaking\nmedicines\nto treat a\nprecancerous\ncondition\nor to \n         keep cancer from starting.\nGeneral Information About Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers\nKey Points\nOvarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the  ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.\nOvarian cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer of the\n\t\t  female reproductive system.\nOvarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the  ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.\nThe\novaries\nare a pair\n\t\t  of\norgans\nin the female\nreproductive\n\t\t  system\n.

Risk factors include smoking, having\noverweight\n, and not getting enough exercise.  Increasing\nprotective factors\nsuch as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.\nThe following are\nrisk\nfactors for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers:\nFamily history of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers\nA woman whose mother or sister  had ovarian cancer has an increased risk of ovarian cancer. A woman with two or  more relatives with ovarian cancer also has an increased risk of ovarian cancer.\nInherited risk\nThe risk of ovarian cancer is increased in women who have\ninherited\ncertain changes in the\nBRCA1\n,\nBRCA2\n, or other\ngenes\n.\nThe risk of ovarian cancer is also increased in women who have certain inherited\nsyndromes\nthat include:\nFamilial\nsite-specific ovarian cancer syndrome.\nFamilial breast/ovarian cancer syndrome.\nHereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer\n(HNPCC;\nLynch syndrome\n).\nHormone replacement therapy\nThere is a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer in women who are taking\nhormone replacement therapy\n(HRT) after\nmenopause\n. There is also an increased risk of ovarian cancer in women who have recently used HRT, even if they used it for less than 5 years. The risk of ovarian cancer is the same for HRT with\nestrogen\nonly or with combined estrogen and\nprogestin\n. \nHRT taken through the skin may have a lower risk than HRT taken by mouth. When HRT is stopped, the risk of ovarian cancer decreases over time.\nThe risk of ovarian cancer is not affected by the age of the woman when taking HRT.\nWeight and height\nBeing overweight or having\nobesity\nis linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Obesity is also linked to an increased risk of death from ovarian cancer. Being tall may also be linked to a slight increase in the risk of ovarian cancer.\nEndometriosis\nWomen who have\nendometriosis\nhave an increased risk of ovarian cancer.\nThe following are\nprotective\nfactors  for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers:\nOral contraceptives\nTaking\noral contraceptives\n(“the pill”) lowers the risk of ovarian\n\t\t\t cancer. The longer oral contraceptives are used, the lower the risk may\n\t\t\t be. The decrease in risk may last up to 30 years after a woman has stopped taking oral\n\t\t\t contraceptives.\nTaking  oral contraceptives increases the risk of\nblood clots\n. This risk is higher in women who also smoke.\nTubal ligation\nThe risk of ovarian cancer is decreased in  women who have a\ntubal ligation\n(\nsurgery\nto close both\nfallopian tubes\n).\nGiving birth\nWomen who have given birth have a decreased risk of ovarian cancer compared to women who have not given birth. Giving birth to more than one child further decreases the risk of ovarian cancer.\nSalpingectomy\nSome studies have shown that salpingectomy (surgery to remove one or both fallopian tubes) is linked with a decreased risk of ovarian cancer.  When both fallopian tubes are removed, the risk of ovarian cancer is lowered more than when one fallopian tube is removed.\nBreastfeeding\nBreastfeeding is  linked to a decreased risk of ovarian cancer. The longer a woman breastfeeds, the lower her risk of ovarian cancer. Women who breastfeed for at least 8 to 10 months have the greatest decrease in risk of ovarian cancer.\nRisk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy\nSome women who have a high risk of ovarian cancer may choose to have a risk-reducing\nsalpingo-oophorectomy\n(surgery to remove the fallopian tubes and ovaries when there are no signs of cancer).  This includes women who have inherited certain changes in the\nBRCA1\nand\nBRCA2\ngenes or have an inherited syndrome.\nIt is very important  to have a cancer risk\n\t\t\t assessment and\ncounseling\nbefore making this decision.  These and other factors may be discussed:\nInfertility\n.\nEarly menopause\n: The drop in estrogen levels caused by removing the ovaries can cause early menopause.\nSymptoms\nof menopause  can worsen and include the following:\nHot flashes\n.\nNight sweats.\nTrouble sleeping.\nMood changes.\nDecreased\nsex drive\n.\nHeart disease.\nVaginal\ndryness.\nFrequent urination.\nOsteoporosis\n(decreased\nbone density\n).\nThese symptoms may not be the same in all women. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may be used to lessen these symptoms.\nRisk of ovarian cancer in the\nperitoneum\n:  Women who have had a  risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy continue to have a small risk of  ovarian cancer in the peritoneum (thin layer of\ntissue\nthat lines the inside of the\nabdomen\n). This is rare, but may occur if  ovarian cancer\ncells\nhad already spread to  the peritoneum before the surgery or if some ovarian tissue remains after surgery.\nIt is not clear whether the  following  affect the risk of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers:\nDiet\nStudies of\ndietary\nfactors have not found a strong link to ovarian cancer.\nAlcohol\nStudies have not shown a link between  drinking\nalcohol\nand  the risk of  ovarian cancer.\nAspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nSome studies of\naspirin\nand\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n(NSAIDs) have found a decreased risk of ovarian cancer and others have not.\nTalc\nStudies of women who used\ntalcum\npowder (talc) dusted on the\nperineum\n(the area between the\nvagina\nand the\nanus\n) have not found clear evidence of an increased risk of ovarian cancer.\nInfertility treatment\nOverall, studies in women using  fertility drugs have not found clear evidence of an increased\n\t\t\t\trisk of ovarian cancer.  The risk of invasive ovarian cancer may be higher in women who do not get\npregnant\nafter taking fertility drugs.\nCancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways \n    to prevent cancer.\nCancer\nprevention\nclinical trials\nare used to study ways to \n         lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some \n         cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who \n         have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. \n         Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had \n         cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type \n         or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. \n         Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known \n         to have any\nrisk factors\nfor cancer.\nThe purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to \n         find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These \n         may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting \n         smoking, or taking certain\nmedicines\n,\nvitamins\n,\nminerals\n, or \n         food\nsupplements\n.\nNew ways to prevent ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are being studied in clinical \n     trials.\nInformation about\nclinical trials\nsupported by\nNCI\ncan be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in\nSpanish\n.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers prevention.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the\nPDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board\n.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at\nNCI's website\n.

        "context": "Breast Cancer Treatment During Pregnancy  (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Breast Cancer Treatment During Pregnancy\nKey Points\nBreast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the tissues of the breast.\nSometimes breast cancer occurs in women who are\n\t\t  pregnant or have just given birth.\nSigns of breast cancer include a lump or change in the breast.\nIt may be difficult to detect (find) breast cancer early in\n\t\t  pregnant or nursing women.\nBreast exams should be part of prenatal and postnatal care.\nTests that examine the breasts are used to diagnose \n\t\t  breast cancer.\nIf cancer is found, tests are done to study the cancer cells.\nCertain factors affect  prognosis\n\t\t  (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nBreast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the tissues of the breast.\nThe\nbreast\nis made up of\nlobes\nand\nducts\n. Each breast has 15 to 20 sections called\n\t\t  lobes. Each lobe has many smaller sections called\nlobules\n. Lobules end in dozens of tiny bulbs that\n\t\t  can make milk. The lobes, lobules, and bulbs are linked by thin tubes called\n\t\t  ducts.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the female breast. The nipple and areola are shown on the outside of the breast. The lymph nodes, lobes, lobules, ducts, and other parts of the inside of the breast are also shown.\nEach breast also has\nblood\n\t\t  vessels\nand\nlymph\n\t\t  vessels\n. The lymph vessels carry an almost colorless, watery\nfluid\ncalled\nlymph\n. Lymph\n\t\t  vessels carry lymph between\nlymph\n\t\t  nodes\n. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures found throughout the body. They\nfilter\nlymph and store\nwhite blood cells\nthat help fight\ninfection\nand disease. Groups of lymph nodes are found near the breast in the\naxilla\n(under the arm), above the\ncollarbone\n, and in the chest.\nSometimes breast cancer occurs in women who are\n\t\t  pregnant or have just given birth.\nBreast cancer\noccurs about once in every 3,000\npregnancies\n. It occurs most often  in women aged 32 to 38 years. Because many women are choosing to delay having children, it is\nlikely that  the number of new cases of breast cancer during pregnancy will increase.\nSigns of breast cancer include a lump or change in the breast.\nThese and other\nsigns\nmay be caused by breast cancer or by other\nconditions\n. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:\nA lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm area.\nA change in the size or shape of the breast.\nA dimple or puckering in the skin of the breast.\nA\nnipple\nturned inward into the breast.\nFluid, other than breast milk, from the nipple, especially if it's bloody.\nScaly, red, or swollen skin on the breast, nipple, or\nareola\n(the dark area of skin around the nipple).\nDimples in the breast that look like the skin of an orange, called\npeau\n\t\td’orange\n.\nIt may be difficult to detect (find) breast cancer early in\n\t\t  pregnant or nursing women.\nThe breasts usually get larger, tender, or lumpy in women who are pregnant, nursing, or have just given birth. This occurs because of normal\nhormone\nchanges that take place during pregnancy. These changes can make small lumps difficult to detect. The breasts may also become denser. It is more difficult to detect breast cancer in women with dense breasts using\nmammography\n. Because these breast changes can delay\ndiagnosis\n, breast cancer is often found at a later\nstage\nin these women.\nBreast exams should be part of prenatal and postnatal care.\nTo detect breast cancer, pregnant and nursing women should examine\n\t\t  their breasts themselves. Women should also receive\nclinical breast\n\t\t  exams\nduring their regular\nprenatal\nand postnatal check-ups. Talk to your doctor if you notice any changes in your breasts that you do not expect or that worry you.\nTests that examine the breasts are used to diagnose \n\t\t  breast cancer.\nThe\n\t\t  following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nClinical breast exam (CBE)\n: An exam of the breast by a doctor or other health professional. The doctor will carefully feel the breasts and under the arms for lumps or anything else that seems unusual.\nUltrasound\nexam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal\ntissues\nor\norgans\nand make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. The picture can be printed to look at later.\nMammogram\n: An\nx-ray\nof the breast. A mammogram can be done with little\n\t\t\t risk to the\nfetus\n. Mammograms in\n\t\t\t pregnant women may appear\nnegative\neven though cancer is present.\nEnlarge\nMammography. The breast is pressed between two plates.  X-rays are used to take pictures of breast tissue.\nBiopsy\n: The removal\n\t\t\t of\ncells\nor tissues so they can be viewed under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. If a lump in the breast is\n\t\t\t found, a biopsy may be done.\nThere are three types of breast biopsies:\nExcisional\n\t\t\t\t  biopsy\n:  The removal of an entire lump of tissue.\nCore biopsy\n:\n\t\t\t\t  The removal of tissue using a wide needle.\nFine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy\n:\n\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t  The removal of tissue or fluid, using a thin needle.\nIf cancer is found, tests are done to study the cancer cells.\nDecisions about the best treatment are based on the results of these tests and the trimester of the pregnancy. The tests give information about:\nHow quickly the cancer may grow.\nHow likely it is that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body.\nHow well certain treatments might work.\nHow likely the cancer is to\nrecur\n(come back).\nTests may include the following:\nEstrogen\nand\nprogesterone receptor test\n: A test to measure the amount of\nestrogen\nand\nprogesterone (hormones) receptors\nin cancer tissue. If there are more estrogen or progesterone receptors than normal, the cancer is called\nestrogen receptor positive\nor\nprogesterone receptor positive\n. This type of breast cancer may grow more quickly. The test results show whether treatment to block estrogen and progesterone given after the baby is born may stop the cancer from growing.\nHuman epidermal growth factor type 2 receptor (HER2/neu) test\n: A\nlaboratory test\nto measure how many\nHER2/neu\ngenes\nthere are and how much HER2/neu\nprotein\nis made in a sample of tissue. If there are more\nHER2/neu\ngenes or higher levels of HER2/neu protein than normal, the cancer is called\nHER2/neu positive\n.  This type of breast cancer may grow more quickly and is more likely to spread to other parts of the body. The cancer may be treated with\ndrugs\nthat target the HER2/neu protein, such as\ntrastuzumab\nand\npertuzumab\n, after the baby is born.\nMultigene tests\n: Tests in which samples of tissue are studied to look at the activity of many genes at the same time. These tests may help predict whether cancer will spread to other parts of the body or recur (come back).\nOncotype DX\n: This test helps predict whether stage I or stage II breast cancer that is\nestrogen receptor positive\nand\nnode-negative\nwill spread to other parts of the body. If the risk of the cancer spreading is high,\nchemotherapy\nmay be given to lower the risk.\nMammaPrint\n: A laboratory test in which the activity of 70 different genes is looked at in the breast cancer tissue of women who have\nearly-stage\ninvasive breast cancer\nthat has not spread to lymph nodes or has spread to 3 or fewer lymph nodes. The activity level of these genes helps predict whether breast cancer will spread to other parts of the body or come back. If the test shows that the risk that the cancer will spread or come back is high, chemotherapy may be given to lower the risk.\nCertain factors affect  prognosis\n\t\t  (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe stage\n\t\t  of the cancer (the size of the\ntumor\nand whether it is in the breast only or has spread to other parts of the body).\nThe type of breast cancer.\nThe trimester of the pregnancy.\nWhether there\n\t\t  are signs or\nsymptoms\n.\nThe patient’s\n\t\t  general health.\nStages of Breast Cancer\nKey Points\nAfter breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done\n\t\t  to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of\n\t\t  the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nIn breast cancer, stage is based on the size and location of the primary tumor, the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body, tumor grade, and whether certain biomarkers are present.\nThe TNM system is used to describe the size of the primary tumor and the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body.\nTumor (T).  The size and location of the tumor.\nLymph Node (N). The size and location of lymph nodes where cancer has spread.\nMetastasis (M). The spread of cancer to other parts of the body.\nThe grading system is used to describe how quickly a breast tumor is likely to grow and spread.\nBiomarker testing is used to find out whether breast cancer cells have certain receptors.\nThe TNM system, the grading system, and biomarker status are combined to find out the breast cancer stage.\nTalk to your doctor to find out what your breast cancer stage is and how it is used to plan the best treatment for you.\nAfter breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done\n\t\t  to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of\n\t\t  the body.\nThe process used to find out if the\ncancer\nhas spread within the\nbreast\nor to other\n\t\t  parts of the body is called\nstaging\n.\n\t\t  The information gathered from the\n\t\t  staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know the stage  in order to plan treatment.\nSome procedures may expose the\nfetus\nto harmful\nradiation\nor dyes. These procedures are done only if absolutely necessary. Certain actions, such as using a\nlead-lined shield\nto cover the\nabdomen\n,  are used to help protect the fetus from radiation as much as possible.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used to stage\nbreast cancer\nduring\npregnancy\n:\nChest x-ray\n: An x-ray of the\norgans\nand bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nBone scan\n: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing\ncells\n, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of\nradioactive\nmaterial is\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nand travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in bones with cancer and is detected by a\nscanner\n.\nUltrasound\nexam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal\ntissues\nor organs, such as the\nliver\n, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\nbrain\n. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if\nbreast cancer\nspreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually breast cancer cells. The disease is metastatic breast cancer, not\nbone cancer\n.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nIn breast cancer, stage is based on the size and location of the primary tumor, the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body, tumor grade, and whether certain biomarkers are present.\nTo plan the best treatment and understand your\nprognosis\n, it is important to know the breast cancer stage.\nThere are 3 types of breast cancer stage groups:\nClinical\nPrognostic Stage\nis used first to assign a stage for\nall\npatients based on\nhealth history\n,\nphysical exam\n,\nimaging tests\n(if done), and\nbiopsies\n. The Clinical Prognostic Stage is described by the\nTNM system\n,\ntumor grade\n, and\nbiomarker\nstatus (\nER\n,\nPR\n,\nHER2\n). In\nclinical staging\n,\nmammography\nor ultrasound is used to check the\nlymph nodes\nfor\nsigns\nof cancer.\nPathological Prognostic Stage\nis then used for patients who have\nsurgery\nas their first treatment. The Pathological Prognostic Stage is based on all clinical information, biomarker status, and\nlaboratory test\nresults from breast tissue and lymph nodes removed during surgery.\nAnatomic\nStage\nis based on the size and the spread of cancer as described by the TNM system. The Anatomic Stage is used in parts of the world where biomarker testing is not available. It is not used in the United States.\nThe TNM system is used to describe the size of the primary tumor and the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body.\nFor breast cancer, the TNM system describes the tumor as follows:\nTumor (T).  The size and location of the tumor.\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in millimeters (mm) or centimeters. Common items that can be used to show  tumor size in mm include: a sharp pencil point (1 mm), a new crayon point (2 mm), a pencil-top eraser (5 mm), a pea (10 mm), a peanut (20 mm), and a lime (50 mm).\nTX: Primary tumor cannot be assessed.\nT0: No sign of a primary tumor in the breast.\nTis:\nCarcinoma in situ\n. There are 2 types of breast carcinoma in situ:\nTis (\nDCIS\n): DCIS is a\ncondition\nin which\nabnormal\ncells are found in the lining of a\nbreast duct\n. The abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast. In some cases, DCIS may become\ninvasive breast cancer\nthat is able to spread to other tissues. At this time, there is no way to know which\nlesions\ncan become invasive.\nTis (\nPaget disease\n): Paget disease of the\nnipple\nis a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the skin cells of the nipple and may spread to the\nareola\n. It is not staged according to the TNM system. If Paget disease AND an invasive breast cancer are present, the TNM system is used to stage the invasive breast cancer.\nT1: The tumor is 20\nmillimeters\nor smaller. There are 4 subtypes of a T1 tumor depending on the size of the tumor:\nT1mi: the tumor is 1 millimeter or smaller.\nT1a: the tumor is larger than 1 millimeter but not larger than 5 millimeters.\nT1b: the tumor is larger than 5 millimeters but not larger than 10 millimeters.\nT1c: the tumor is larger than 10 millimeters but not larger than 20 millimeters.\nT2: The tumor is larger than 20 millimeters but not larger than 50 millimeters.\nT3: The tumor is larger than 50 millimeters.\nT4: The tumor is described as one of the following:\nT4a: the tumor has grown into the\nchest wall\n.\nT4b: the tumor has grown into the skin—an\nulcer\nhas formed on the surface of the skin on the breast, small tumor nodules have formed in the same breast as the primary tumor, and/or there is swelling of the skin on the breast.\nT4c: the tumor has grown into the chest wall and the skin.\nT4d:\ninflammatory breast cancer\n—one-third or more of the skin on the breast is red and swollen (called\npeau d’orange\n).\nLymph Node (N). The size and location of lymph nodes where cancer has spread.\nWhen the lymph nodes are removed by surgery and studied under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\n, pathologic staging is used to describe the lymph nodes. The pathologic staging of lymph nodes is described below.\nNX: The lymph nodes cannot be assessed.\nN0:  No sign of cancer in the lymph nodes, or tiny clusters of cancer cells not larger than 0.2 millimeters in the lymph nodes.\nN1: Cancer is described as one of the following:\nN1mi: cancer has spread to the\naxillary (armpit area) lymph nodes\nand is larger than 0.2 millimeters but not larger than 2 millimeters.\nN1a: cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters.\nN1b: cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the\nbreastbone\non the same side of the body as the primary tumor, and the cancer is larger than 0.2 millimeters and is found by\nsentinel lymph node biopsy\n. Cancer is not found in the axillary lymph nodes.\nN1c: cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer is also found by sentinel lymph node biopsy in the lymph nodes near the breastbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor.\nN2: Cancer is described as one of the following:\nN2a: cancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters.\nN2b: cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone and the cancer is found by imaging tests. Cancer is not found in the axillary lymph nodes by sentinel lymph node biopsy or\nlymph node dissection\n.\nN3: Cancer is described as one of the following:\nN3a: cancer has spread to 10 or more axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters, or cancer has spread to lymph nodes below the\ncollarbone\n.\nN3b: cancer has spread to 1 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer has also spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone and the cancer is found by imaging tests;\nor\ncancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer has also spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor, and the cancer is  larger than 0.2 millimeters and is found by sentinel lymph node biopsy.\nN3c: cancer has spread to lymph nodes above the collarbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor.\nWhen the lymph nodes are checked using mammography or ultrasound, it is called clinical staging. The clinical staging of lymph nodes is not described here.\nMetastasis (M). The spread of cancer to other parts of the body.\nM0: There is no sign that cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\nM1: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body, most often the bones,\nlungs\n, liver, or brain. If cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes, the cancer in the lymph nodes is larger than 0.2 millimeters. The cancer is called metastatic breast cancer.\nThe grading system is used to describe how quickly a breast tumor is likely to grow and spread.\nThe\ngrading\nsystem describes a tumor based on how abnormal the cancer cells and tissue look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer cells are likely to grow and spread.\nLow-grade\ncancer cells look more like normal cells and tend to grow and spread more slowly than\nhigh-grade\ncancer cells. To describe how abnormal the cancer cells and tissue are, the pathologist will assess the following three features:\nHow much of the tumor tissue has normal breast ducts.\nThe size and shape of the\nnuclei\nin the tumor cells.\nHow many dividing cells are present, which is a measure of how fast the tumor cells are growing and dividing.\nFor each feature, the pathologist assigns a score of 1 to 3; a score of “1” means the cells and tumor tissue look the most like normal cells and tissue, and a score of “3” means the cells and tissue look the most abnormal. The scores for each feature are added together to get a total score between 3 and 9.\nThree grades are possible:\nTotal score of 3 to 5: G1 (Low grade or\nwell differentiated\n).\nTotal score of 6 to 7: G2 (\nIntermediate grade\nor moderately differentiated).\nTotal score of 8 to 9: G3 (High grade or poorly differentiated).\nBiomarker testing is used to find out whether breast cancer cells have certain receptors.\nHealthy breast cells, and some breast cancer cells, have\nreceptors\n(biomarkers) that attach to the\nhormones\nestrogen\nand\nprogesterone\n. These hormones are needed for healthy cells, and some breast cancer cells, to grow and divide. To check for these biomarkers, samples of tissue containing breast cancer cells are removed during a\nbiopsy\nor surgery. The samples are tested in a laboratory to see whether the breast cancer cells have\nestrogen\nor\nprogesterone receptors\n.\nAnother type of receptor (biomarker) that is found on the surface of all breast cancer cells is called HER2. HER2 receptors are needed for the breast cancer cells to grow and divide.\nFor breast cancer, biomarker testing includes the following:\nEstrogen receptor (ER)\n. If the breast cancer cells have estrogen receptors, the cancer cells are called\nER positive\n(ER+). If the breast cancer cells do not have estrogen receptors, the cancer cells are called\nER negative\n(ER-).\nProgesterone receptor (PR)\n. If the breast cancer cells have progesterone receptors, the cancer cells are called\nPR positive\n(PR+). If the breast cancer cells do not have progesterone receptors, the cancer cells are called\nPR negative\n(PR-).\nHuman epidermal growth factor type 2 receptor (HER2/neu or HER2)\n. If the breast cancer cells have larger than normal amounts of HER2 receptors on their surface, the cancer cells are called\nHER2 positive\n(HER2+). If the breast cancer cells have a normal amount of HER2 on their surface, the cancer cells are called\nHER2 negative\n(HER2-). HER2+ breast cancer is more likely to grow and divide faster than HER2- breast cancer.\nSometimes the breast cancer cells will be described as\ntriple negative\nor\ntriple positive\n.\nTriple negative\n. If the breast cancer cells do not have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or a larger than normal amount of HER2 receptors, the cancer cells are called triple negative.\nTriple positive\n. If the breast cancer cells do have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and a larger than normal amount of HER2 receptors, the cancer cells are called triple positive.\nIt is important to know the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 receptor status to choose the best treatment. There are\ndrugs\nthat can stop the receptors from attaching to the hormones estrogen and progesterone and stop the cancer from growing. Other drugs may be used to block the HER2 receptors on the surface of the breast cancer cells and stop the cancer from growing.\nThe TNM system, the grading system, and biomarker status are combined to find out the breast cancer stage.\nHere are 3 examples that combine the TNM system, the grading system, and the biomarker status to find out the Pathological Prognostic breast cancer stage for a woman whose first treatment was surgery:\nIf the tumor size is 30 millimeters (T2), has not spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0), has not spread to distant parts of the body (M0), and is:\nGrade 1\nHER2+\nER-\nPR-\nThe cancer is stage IIA.\nIf the tumor size is 53 millimeters (T3), has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes (N2), has not spread to other parts of the body (M0), and is:\nGrade 2\nHER2+\nER+\nPR-\nThe tumor is stage IIIA.\nIf the tumor size is 65 millimeters (T3), has spread to 3 axillary lymph nodes (N1a), has spread to the lungs (M1), and is:\nGrade 1\nHER2+\nER-\nPR-\nThe cancer is stage IV (metastatic breast cancer).\nTalk to your doctor to find out what your breast cancer stage is and how it is used to plan the best treatment for you.\nAfter surgery, your doctor will receive a\npathology report\nthat describes the size and location of the primary tumor, the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes, tumor grade, and whether certain biomarkers are present. The pathology report and other test results are used to determine your breast cancer stage.\nYou are likely to have many questions. Ask your doctor to explain how staging is used to decide the best options to treat your cancer and whether there are\nclinical trials\nthat might be right for you.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nTreatment options for pregnant women depend on the stage of the\n\t\t  disease and the trimester of the pregnancy.\nThree types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nEnding the pregnancy does not seem to improve the mother’s\n\t\t  chance of survival.\nTreatment for breast cancer may cause side effects.\nTreatment options for pregnant women depend on the stage of the\n\t\t  disease and the trimester of the pregnancy.\nThree types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nMost\npregnant\nwomen with\nbreast cancer\nhave\nsurgery\nto remove the\nbreast\n. Some of the\nlymph\n\t\t\t nodes\nunder the arm may be removed so they can be checked under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nfor\nsigns\nof\ncancer\n.\nTypes of surgery to remove the cancer include:\nModified radical\n\t\t\t\tmastectomy\n: Surgery to remove the whole breast that has cancer. This may include removal of the\nnipple\n,\nareola\n(the dark-colored skin around the nipple), and skin over the breast. Most of the lymph nodes under the arm are also removed.\nEnlarge\nModified radical mastectomy.  The whole breast and most of the lymph nodes under the arm are removed.\nBreast-conserving\n\t\t\t surgery\n: Surgery to remove the cancer and some normal\ntissue\naround it, but not the breast\n\t\t\t itself. Part of the chest wall lining may also be removed if the cancer is near it. This type of surgery may also be called lumpectomy, partial mastectomy, segmental mastectomy, quadrantectomy, or breast-sparing surgery.\nEnlarge\nLumpectomy. The tumor and some normal tissue around it are removed, but not the breast itself. Some lymph nodes under the arm may also be removed. If the cancer is near the chest wall, part of the chest wall lining may be removed as well.\nAfter the doctor removes all of the cancer that can be seen at\n\t\t\t the time of surgery, some patients may be given\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nafter surgery to kill any cancer\ncells\nthat are left. For pregnant women with\nearly-stage breast cancer\n, radiation therapy and\nhormone therapy\nare given after the baby is born. Treatment given after surgery, to\n\t\t\t lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant\n\t\t\t therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nExternal radiation therapy may be given to pregnant women with early\nstage\n(stage I or II)  breast cancer after the baby is born.  Women with late stage (stage III or IV) breast cancer may be given external radiation therapy after the first 3 months of pregnancy or, if possible, radiation therapy is delayed until after the baby is born.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nChemotherapy is usually not given during the first 3 months\n\t\t\t of pregnancy. Chemotherapy given after this time does not usually harm the\nfetus\nbut may cause early labor or\n\t\t\t low birth weight.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Breast Cancer\nfor more information.\nEnding the pregnancy does not seem to improve the mother’s\n\t\t  chance of survival.\nBecause ending the pregnancy is not likely to improve the mother’s chance of survival, it is not usually a treatment option.\nTreatment for breast cancer may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nTreatment of Early Stage Breast Cancer During Pregnancy\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nPregnant\nwomen with\nearly-stage breast cancer\n(stage\n\t\t  I and stage II) are usually treated in the same way as patients who are not pregnant, with \nsome changes   to protect the\nfetus\n. Treatment may include the following:\nModified\n\t\t\t radical mastectomy\n, if the\nbreast cancer\nwas\ndiagnosed\nearly in\npregnancy\n.\nBreast-conserving\n\t\t\t surgery\n, if the breast cancer is diagnosed later in pregnancy.\nRadiation therapy\nmay be given after the baby is born.\nModified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery during pregnancy. After the first 3 months of pregnancy, certain types of\nchemotherapy\nmay be given before or after\nsurgery\n.\nHormone therapy\nand\ntrastuzumab\nshould not be given during pregnancy.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "question": "What are the treatments for Merkel Cell Carcinoma ?",
        "right_answer": "Key Points\n                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma.    - Three types of standard treatment are used:         - Surgery     - Radiation therapy     - Chemotherapy        - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.    - Treatment for Merkel cell carcinoma may cause side effects.    - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.\n                \n                \n                    There are different types of treatment for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma.\n                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\n                \n                \n                    Three types of standard treatment are used:\n                    Surgery    One or more of the following surgical procedures may be used to treat Merkel cell carcinoma:            -  Wide local excision: The cancer is cut from the skin along with some of the tissue around it. A sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done during the wide local excision procedure. If there is cancer in the lymph nodes, a lymph node dissection also may be done.     - Lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. For a regional lymph node dissection, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed; for a radical lymph node dissection, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.           Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat Merkel cell carcinoma, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.\n                \n                \n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\n                    \n                \n                \n                    Treatment for Merkel cell carcinoma may cause side effects.\n                    For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.\n                \n                \n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\n                \n                \n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.\n                \n                \n                    Follow-up tests may be needed.\n                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.\n                \n\t\t        \n\t\t            Treatment Options by Stage\n\t\t            \n\t\t                \n\t\t                    Stage I and Stage II Merkel Cell Carcinoma\n\t\t                    Treatment of stage I and stage II Merkel cell carcinoma may include the following:         -  Surgery to remove the tumor, such as wide local excision with or without lymph node dissection.    -  Radiation therapy after surgery.    - A clinical trial of a new treatment.

        "context": "Merkel Cell Carcinoma Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Merkel Cell Carcinoma\nKey Points\nMerkel cell carcinoma  is a very rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the skin.\nSun exposure and having a weak immune system can affect the risk of Merkel cell carcinoma.\nMerkel cell carcinoma usually appears as a single painless lump on sun-exposed skin.\nTests and procedures that examine the skin  are used to diagnose Merkel cell carcinoma.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nMerkel cell carcinoma  is a very rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the skin.\nMerkel cells\nare  found in the top layer of the skin. These cells are very close to the\nnerve\nendings that receive the sensation of touch.\nMerkel cell carcinoma\n, also called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin or trabecular cancer, is a very rare type  of\nskin cancer\nthat  forms when Merkel cells grow out of control. Merkel cell carcinoma starts most often in areas of skin exposed to the sun, especially the head and neck, as well as the arms, legs, and\ntrunk\n.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the skin showing the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. Merkel cells are in the layer of basal cells at the deepest part of the epidermis and are connected to nerves.\nMerkel cell carcinoma tends to grow quickly and to\nmetastasize\n(spread) at an early\nstage\n. It   usually spreads first to nearby\nlymph nodes\nand then may spread to lymph nodes or skin in distant parts of the body,\nlungs\n,\nbrain\n, bones, or other\norgans\n.\nMerkel cell carcinoma is the second most common cause of skin cancer death after\nmelanoma\n.\nSun exposure and having a weak immune system can affect the risk of Merkel cell carcinoma.\nAnything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called \n         a\nrisk factor\n.  Having a risk factor does not mean that you will \n         get\ncancer\n; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will \n         not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for Merkel cell carcinoma include the following:\nBeing exposed to a lot of natural sunlight.\nBeing exposed to artificial sunlight, such as from tanning beds or\npsoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy\nfor\npsoriasis\n.\nHaving an\nimmune system\nweakened by disease, such as\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia\nor\nHIV\ninfection\n.\nTaking\ndrugs\nthat  make the immune system less active,  such as after an organ\ntransplant\n.\nHaving a\nhistory\nof other types of cancer.\nBeing older than 50 years, male, or White.\nMerkel cell carcinoma usually appears as a single painless lump on sun-exposed skin.\nThis and other changes in the skin may be caused by Merkel cell carcinoma or by other\nconditions\n. Check with your doctor if you see changes in your skin.\nMerkel cell carcinoma usually appears  on sun-exposed skin as a single lump that  is:\nFast-growing.\nPainless.\nFirm and dome-shaped or raised.\nRed or violet in color.\nTests and procedures that examine the skin  are used to diagnose Merkel cell carcinoma.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general\nsigns\nof health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nFull-body skin exam\n: A doctor or\nnurse\nchecks the skin for bumps or spots that look\nabnormal\nin color, size, shape, or texture. The size, shape, and texture of the lymph nodes will also be checked.\nSkin\nbiopsy\n: The removal of skin\ncells\nor\ntissues\nso they can be viewed under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe stage of the cancer (the size of the\ntumor\nand whether it has spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body).\nWhere the cancer is in the body.\nWhether the cancer has just been\ndiagnosed\nor has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nThe patient's age and general health.\nPrognosis also depends on  how deeply  the tumor has grown into the skin.\nStages of Merkel Cell Carcinoma\nKey Points\nAfter Merkel cell carcinoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread  to other parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for Merkel cell carcinoma:\nStage 0 (carcinoma in situ)\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nMerkel cell carcinoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nAfter Merkel cell carcinoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread  to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread  to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the\norgans\nor\ntissues\nshow up more clearly.  A CT scan of the chest and\nabdomen\nmay be used to check for\nprimary\nsmall cell lung cancer\n, or to find\nMerkel cell carcinoma\nthat has spread. A CT scan of the head and neck may also be used to find Merkel cell carcinoma that has spread to the\nlymph nodes\n. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor\ncells\nin the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nLymph node biopsy\n: There are several types of lymph node biopsy used to stage Merkel cell carcinoma.\nSentinel lymph node biopsy\n:  The removal of the\nsentinel lymph node\nduring\nsurgery\n. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node in a group of lymph nodes to receive\nlymphatic drainage\nfrom the\nprimary tumor\n. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor.  A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor.  The substance or dye flows through the\nlymph\nducts\nto the lymph nodes.  The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed.   A\npathologist\nviews the tissue under a\nmicroscope\nto look for cancer cells.  If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes.\nEnlarge\nSentinel lymph node biopsy of the skin. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor (first panel). The injected material is detected visually and/or with a probe that detects radioactivity (middle panel). The sentinel nodes (the first lymph nodes to take up the material) are removed and checked for cancer cells (last panel).\nLymph node dissection\n: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for\nsigns\nof cancer. For a\nregional lymph node dissection\n, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. For a\nradical lymph node dissection\n, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.\nCore needle biopsy\n: A procedure to remove a sample of tissue using a wide needle.  A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.\nFine-needle aspiration biopsy\n: A procedure to remove a sample of tissue using a thin needle. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.\nImmunohistochemistry\n:  A\nlaboratory test\nthat uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help\ndiagnose\ncancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  Merkel cell carcinoma spreads to the\nliver\n, the cancer cells in the liver are actually cancerous Merkel cells. The disease is metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, not liver cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for Merkel cell carcinoma:\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).\nStage 0 (carcinoma in situ)\nIn\nstage 0\n,\nabnormal\nMerkel cells\nare found in the top layer of skin. These abnormal\ncells\nmay become\ncancer\nand spread into nearby normal\ntissue\n.\nStage I\nIn\nstage I\n, the\ntumor\nis 2\ncentimeters\nor smaller.\nStage II\nStage II Merkel cell carcinoma\nis divided into stages IIA and IIB.\nIn stage IIA, the\ntumor\nis larger than 2\ncentimeters\n.\nIn stage IIB, the tumor has spread to nearby\nconnective tissue\n, muscle,\ncartilage\n, or bone.\nStage III\nStage III Merkel cell carcinoma\nis divided into stages IIIA and IIIB.\nIn stage IIIA, either of the following is found:\nthe\ntumor\nmay be any size and may have spread to nearby\nconnective tissue\n, muscle,\ncartilage\n, or bone. A\nlymph node\ncannot be felt during a\nphysical exam\nbut\ncancer\nis found in the lymph node by\nsentinel lymph node biopsy\nor after the lymph node is removed and checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor\nsigns\nof cancer; or\na swollen lymph node is felt during a physical exam and/or seen on an\nimaging test\n. When the lymph node is removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer, cancer is found in the lymph node. The place where the cancer began is not known.\nIn stage IIIB, the tumor may be any size and:\nmay have spread to nearby connective tissue, muscle, cartilage, or bone. A swollen lymph node is felt during a physical exam and/or seen on an imaging test. When the lymph node is removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer, cancer is found in the lymph node; or\ncancer is in a\nlymph vessel\nbetween the\nprimary tumor\nand lymph nodes that are near or far away. Cancer may have spread to lymph nodes.\nStage IV\nIn\nstage IV\n, the\ntumor\nhas spread to skin  that is not close to the\nprimary tumor\nor to other parts of the body, such as the\nliver\n,\nlung\n, bone, or\nbrain\n.\nMerkel cell carcinoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nThe cancer may come back in the skin,\nlymph nodes\n, or other parts of the body. It is common for Merkel cell carcinoma to\nrecur\n.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma.\nFour types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for Merkel cell carcinoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for patients with\nMerkel cell carcinoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nFour types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nOne or more of the following\nsurgical\nprocedures may be used to treat Merkel cell carcinoma:\nWide local excision\n: The cancer is cut from the skin along with  some of the\ntissue\naround it. A\nsentinel lymph node biopsy\nmay be done during the wide local excision procedure. If there is cancer in the\nlymph nodes\n, a\nlymph node dissection\nalso may be done.\nLymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed and  a sample of tissue is checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor\nsigns\nof cancer. For a\nregional lymph node dissection\n, some of the lymph nodes in the\ntumor\narea are removed; for a\nradical lymph node dissection\n, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nafter surgery to kill any cancer\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. It is used to treat Merkel cell carcinoma, and may also be used as\npalliative therapy\nto relieve\nsymptoms\nand improve\nquality of life\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient’s\nimmune system\nto fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer.  This cancer treatment is a type of\nbiologic therapy\n.\nSome types of immune cells, such as\nT cells\n, and some cancer cells have certain\nproteins\n, called checkpoint proteins, on their surface that keep\nimmune responses\nin check. When cancer cells have large amounts of these proteins, they will not be attacked and killed by T cells.\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors\nblock these proteins and the ability of T cells to kill cancer cells is increased.\nThere are two types of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy:\nPD-1\nand\nPD-L1\ninhibitor therapy: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body's immune responses in check. PD-L1 is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other. This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells.\nPembrolizumab\n(a type of PD-1 inhibitor) and\navelumab\n(a type of PD-L1 inhibitor) are used to treat\nadvanced\nMerkel cell carcinoma.\nNivolumab\nis a type of PD-1 inhibitor being studied to treat advanced Merkel cell carcinoma.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nImmunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.\nCTLA-4\ninhibitor therapy: CTLA-4 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body’s immune responses in check. When CTLA-4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell.

        "context": "Childhood Vascular Tumors Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Childhood Vascular Tumors\nKey Points\nChildhood vascular tumors can form anywhere in the body from abnormal blood vessel or lymph vessel cells.\nTests are used to diagnose childhood vascular tumors.\nChildhood vascular tumors may be classified into four groups.\nBenign tumors\nIntermediate tumors that may spread locally\nIntermediate tumors that may spread to other parts of the body\nMalignant tumors\nChildhood vascular tumors can form anywhere in the body from abnormal blood vessel or lymph vessel cells.\nThese\ntumors\nmay be\nbenign\n(not\ncancer\n) or\nmalignant\n(cancer). There are many types of\nvascular tumors\n.  The most common type of childhood vascular tumor is\ninfantile hemangioma\n, which is a\nbenign tumor\nthat usually goes away on its own.\nBecause malignant vascular tumors are rare in children, there is not a lot of information about what treatment works best.\nTests are used to diagnose childhood vascular tumors.\nIn addition to asking about your child's\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nUltrasound\nexam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal\ntissues\nor\norgans\nand make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.\nEnlarge\nAbdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound transducer connected to a computer is pressed against the skin of the abdomen. The transducer bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A dye may be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nEnlarge\nComputed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nEnlarge\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.\nX-ray\n: An x-ray of the bones or the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nBiopsy\n: The removal of\ncells\nor tissues \n          so they can be viewed under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. \n     A biopsy is not always needed to\ndiagnose\na vascular tumor.\nChildhood vascular tumors may be classified into four groups.\nBenign tumors\nBenign tumors are not cancer. This summary has information about the following\nbenign vascular tumors\n:\nInfantile hemangioma.\nCongenital hemangioma\n.\nBenign vascular tumors of the\nliver\n.\nSpindle cell hemangioma\n.\nEpithelioid hemangioma\n.\nPyogenic granuloma\n(lobular capillary hemangioma).\nAngiofibroma\n.\nJuvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma\n.\nIntermediate tumors that may spread locally\nSome intermediate tumors are likely to spread to the area around the tumor (locally), but not to other parts of the body. This summary has information about the following tumors that spread locally:\nKaposiform hemangioendothelioma\nand\ntufted angioma\n.\nIntermediate tumors that may spread to other parts of the body\nRarely, intermediate tumors spread  to other parts of the body (\nmetastasize\n).

Some \n         treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and \n         some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n. A treatment clinical \n         trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current \n         treatments or obtain information on new treatments. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is \n         better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may \n         become the standard treatment.\nBecause vascular tumors in children are rare, taking part in a clinical \n         trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only \n         to patients who have not started treatment.\nChildren with childhood vascular tumors should have their treatment planned \n         by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating \n         cancer in children.\nTreatment will be overseen by a\npediatric oncologist\n, a doctor \n         who specializes in treating children with\ncancer\n. The pediatric \n         oncologist works with other\npediatric\nhealth care providers\nwho \n         are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize \n         in certain areas of\nmedicine\n. These may include the following\nspecialists\n:\nPediatric vascular anomaly specialist (expert in treating children with vascular tumors).\nPediatric surgeon\n.\nOrthopedic surgeon\n.\nRadiation oncologist\n.\nPediatric nurse specialist\n.\nRehabilitation specialist\n.\nPsychologist\n.\nSocial worker\n.\nTwelve types of standard treatment are used:\nBeta-blocker therapy\nBeta-blockers\nare\ndrugs\nthat decrease\nblood pressure\nand\nheart rate\n. When used in patients with vascular tumors, beta-blockers may help shrink  the\ntumors\n. Beta-blocker\ntherapy\nmay be given by\nvein\n(\nIV\n), by mouth, or placed on the skin (\ntopical\n). The way the beta-blocker therapy is given depends on the type of vascular tumor and where the tumor first formed.\nThe beta-blocker\npropranolol\nis usually the first treatment for hemangiomas.  Infants younger than 4 weeks, or who have an underlying\ncondition\n, or who are treated with IV propranolol may need to have their treatment started  in a hospital. Propranolol is also used to treat\nbenign vascular tumor\nof\nliver\nand\nkaposiform hemangioendothelioma\n.\nOther beta-blockers used to treat vascular tumors include atenolol, nadolol, and timolol.\nInfantile hemangioma\nmay also be treated with propranolol and\nsteroid therapy\nor propranolol and topical beta-blocker therapy.\nSee the drug information summary on\nPropranolol Hydrochloride\nfor more information.\nSurgery\nThe following types of\nsurgery\nmay be used to remove many types of vascular tumors:\nExcision\n: Surgery to remove the entire tumor and some of the healthy\ntissue\naround it.\nLaser surgery\n: A surgical procedure that uses a\nlaser beam\n(a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a skin\nlesion\nsuch as a tumor. Surgery with a pulsed dye laser may be used for some hemangiomas. This type of laser uses a beam of light that targets\nblood vessels\nin the skin. The light is changed into heat and the blood vessels are destroyed without damaging nearby skin.\nCurettage\n: A procedure in which\nabnormal\ntissue is removed using a small, spoon-shaped instrument with a sharp edge called a\ncurette\n.\nTotal\nhepatectomy\nand liver\ntransplant\n: A surgical procedure to remove the entire liver followed by a transplant of a healthy liver from a\ndonor\n.\nThe type of surgery used depends on the type of vascular tumor and where the tumor formed in the body.\nFor\nmalignant\ntumors, after the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen \n         at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nto kill any \n         cancer\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given after the surgery, \n         to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant \n         therapy\n.\nPhotocoagulation\nPhotocoagulation\nis the use of an intense beam of light, such as a laser, to seal off blood vessels or destroy tissue. It is used to treat\npyogenic granuloma\n.\nCryotherapy\nCryotherapy\nis a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue, such as abnormal blood vessels in pyogenic granuloma. This type of treatment is also called cryosurgery.\nFor more information, see\nCryosurgery to Treat Cancer\n.\nEmbolization\nEmbolization\nis a procedure that uses particles, such as tiny gelatin sponges or beads, to block blood vessels in the liver. It may be used to treat some benign vascular tumors of the liver and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs \n         to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the \n         cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body. Sometimes more than one anticancer drug is given. This is called\ncombination chemotherapy\n.\nSclerotherapy\nSclerotherapy\nis a treatment used to destroy the blood vessel that leads to the tumor and the tumor. A liquid is injected into the blood vessel, causing it to scar and break down. Over time, the   destroyed blood vessel is absorbed into normal tissue. The blood flows through nearby healthy veins instead. Sclerotherapy is used in the treatment of\nepithelioid hemangioma\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a treatment that \n         uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill \n         tumor cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a \n         machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with the tumor. It is used to treat some vascular tumors.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nuses drugs or other substances to block the action of specific enzymes, proteins, or other molecules involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. Different types of targeted therapy are being used or studied to treat childhood vascular tumors:\nAngiogenesis inhibitors\n: Angiogenesis inhibitors are drugs that stop cells from dividing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. The targeted therapy drugs\nthalidomide\n,\nsorafenib\n, and\npazopanib\nare angiogenesis inhibitors used to treat childhood vascular tumors.\nMammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors\n: This treatment blocks a\nprotein\ncalled\nmTOR\n, which may keep cancer cells from growing and prevent new blood vessels from forming.\nSirolimus\nis an mTOR inhibitor used to treat childhood vascular tumors.\nKinase inhibitors\n: Kinase inhibitors block signals needed for tumors to grow.\nTrametinib\nis being studied to treat\nepithelioid hemangioendothelioma\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nhelps a person's immune system fight cancer.\nThe following types of immunotherapy are being used in the treatment of childhood vascular tumors:\nInterferon\n: This treatment interferes with the division of tumor cells and can slow tumor growth. It may be used to treat\njuvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma\n,\nKaposi sarcoma\n, and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor\ntherapy: This treatment blocks proteins called checkpoints that are made by some types of immune system cells, such as\nT cells\n, and some tumor cells. When tumor cells have large amounts of these proteins, they will not be attacked and killed by T cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors increase the ability of T cells to kill tumor cells.\nThere are two types of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy:\nCTLA-4\ninhibitor therapy: CTLA-4 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body’s\nimmune responses\nin check. When CTLA-4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a tumor cell, it stops the T cell from killing the tumor cell. CTLA-4 inhibitors attach to CTLA-4 and allow the T cells to kill tumor cells.\nIpilimumab\nis a type of CTLA-4 inhibitor being studied in the treatment of\nangiosarcoma\nof the\nsoft tissue\n.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as B7-1/B7-2 on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and CTLA-4 on T cells, help keep the body’s immune responses in check. When the T-cell receptor (TCR) binds to antigen and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the APC and CD28 binds to B7-1/B7-2 on the APC, the T cell can be activated. However, the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 keeps the T cells in the inactive state so they are not able to kill tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) allows the T cells to be active and to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nPD-1\nand\nPD-L1\ninhibitor therapy: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body’s immune responses in check. PD-L1 is a protein found on some types of tumor cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the tumor cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other. This allows the T cells to kill tumor cells.\nNivolumab\nis a type of PD-1 inhibitor being studied in the treatment of angiosarcoma of the soft tissue.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nImmunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.\nOther drug therapy\nOther drugs used to treat childhood vascular tumors or manage their effects include the following:\nSteroid\ntherapy: Steroids are\nhormones\nmade naturally in the body. They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs.\nSteroid drugs\nhelp shrink some vascular tumors.\nCorticosteroids\n, such as\nprednisone\nand\nmethylprednisolone\n, are used to treat infantile hemangioma.\nImmunosuppressant therapy\n: These drugs decrease the body's immune responses. Immunosuppressant therapy has been used to help shrink vascular tumors. Topical\ntacrolimus\nis used to treat kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and\ntufted angiomas\n.\nThyroid hormone replacement therapy: Man-made hormones are used to treat a rare form of\nhypothyroidism\ncaused by some vascular tumors, such as liver hemangiomas.\nObservation\nObservation is closely\nmonitoring\na patient’s condition without giving any treatment until\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nappear or change.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical \n         trials.\nInformation about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for childhood vascular tumors may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSome treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, cause side effects that continue \n         or appear months or years after treatment has ended. \n         These are called\nlate effects\n. Late effects of treatment may include the following:\nPhysical problems.\nChanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or \n          memory.\nSecond cancers\n(new types of cancer).\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important \n         to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late \n         effects caused by some treatments. For more information, see\nLate Effects of Treatment\n         for Childhood Cancer\n.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a \n         clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.\nMany of today's standard treatments are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way disease will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or \n         after starting their tumor treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose tumors have not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop tumors from\nrecurring\n(coming back) or reduce the side effects of treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI's\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nSome of the tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nthe vascular tumor may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the tumor has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called\nfollow-up\ntests or check-ups.\nBenign Tumors\nIn This Section\nInfantile Hemangioma\nCongenital Hemangioma\nBenign Vascular Tumors of the Liver\nSpindle Cell Hemangioma\nEpithelioid Hemangioma\nPyogenic Granuloma\nAngiofibroma\nJuvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nInfantile Hemangioma\nInfantile hemangiomas\nare the most common type of\nbenign vascular tumor\nin children. Infantile hemangiomas form when immature\ncells\nthat are meant to form\nblood vessels\nform a\ntumor\ninstead. An infantile hemangioma may also be called a \"strawberry mark.\"\nThese tumors are not usually seen at birth but appear when the infant is 3 to 6 weeks old. Most hemangiomas get bigger for about 5 months and then  stop growing. The hemangiomas slowly fade away over the next several years, but a red mark or loose or wrinkled skin may remain. It is rare for an infantile hemangioma to come back after it has faded away.\nInfantile hemangiomas may be on the skin, in the\ntissue\nbelow the skin, and/or in an\norgan\n.  They are usually on the head and neck but can be anywhere on or in the body.    Hemangiomas may appear as a single\nlesion\n, one or more lesions spread over a larger area of the body, or multiple  lesions in more than one part of the body.  Lesions that are spread over a larger area of the body or multiple lesions are more likely to cause problems.\nInfantile hemangioma with minimal or arrested growth (IH-MAG) is a certain type of infantile hemangioma that is seen at birth and does not tend to get bigger. The lesion appears as light and dark areas of redness in the skin. The lesions are usually on the lower body but can be on the head and neck. Hemangiomas of this type go away over time without treatment.\nRisk Factors\nA\nrisk factor\nis anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Not every child with a risk factor will develop infantile hemangiomas, and they can develop in some children who don't have a known risk factor. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk of an infantile hemangioma.\nInfantile hemangiomas are more common in the following:\nGirls.\nWhite patients.\nPremature babies.\nTwins, triplets, or other multiple births.\nBabies of mothers who are older at the time of the\npregnancy\n, have pre-eclampsia (\nhigh blood pressure\nduring pregnancy), or who have problems with the\nplacenta\nduring pregnancy.\nOther risk factors for infantile hemangiomas include the following:\nHaving a\nfamily history\nof infantile hemangioma, usually in a mother, father, sister, or brother.\nHaving certain\nsyndromes\n.\nPHACE syndrome\n: A syndrome in which the hemangioma spreads across a large area of the head or face and sometimes the neck, chest, or arm. Other health problems that affect the large blood vessels, heart, eyes, and/or brain may also occur.\nLUMBAR/PELVIS/SACRAL syndrome\n: A syndrome in which the hemangioma spreads across a large area of the lower back. Other health problems that affect the\nurinary\nsystem,\ngenitals\n,\nrectum\n,\nanus\n, brain,\nspinal cord\n, and\nnerve\nfunction may also occur.\nHaving more than one hemangioma or a hemangioma in the airway or eyes increases the risk of  having other health problems.\nMultiple hemangiomas: Having more than five hemangiomas on the skin is a\nsign\nthat there may be hemangiomas in an organ. The\nliver\nis affected most often. Heart, muscle, and\nthyroid gland\nproblems can also occur.\nAirway hemangiomas: Hemangiomas in the airway  usually occur along with a large, beard-shaped area of hemangioma on the face (from the ears, around the mouth, lower chin, and front of neck).  It is important that airway hemangiomas are treated before the child has trouble breathing.\nOphthalmic\nhemangiomas:  Hemangiomas that involve the eye may cause vision problems or blindness.  Infantile hemangiomas can occur  in the\nconjunctiva\n(a\nmembrane\nthat lines the inner surface of the eyelid and covers the front part of the eye). These hemangiomas may be linked with other\nabnormal\nconditions\nof the eye. It is important that children with an ophthalmic hemangioma are examined by an\nophthalmologist\n.\nSigns and Symptoms\nInfantile hemangiomas may cause any of the following signs and\nsymptoms\n. Check with your child’s doctor if your child has any of the following:\nSkin lesions: An area of spidery veins or lightened  or discolored skin may appear before the hemangioma does. Hemangiomas occur as firm, warm, bright red to crimson lesions on the skin or may look like a bruise. Lesions that form\nulcers\nare also painful. Later, as the hemangiomas go away,  they become softer and begin fading in the center before flattening and losing color.\nLesions below the skin: Lesions that grow under the skin in the fat may appear blue or purple. If the lesions  are deep enough under the skin surface, they may not be seen.\nLesions in an organ: There may be no signs that hemangiomas have formed on an organ.\nAlthough most infantile hemangiomas are nothing to worry about, if your child develops any lumps or red or blue marks on the skin check with your child's doctor. He or she can refer the child to a\nspecialist\nif needed.\nDiagnostic Tests\nA\nphysical exam\nand\nhistory\nare usually all that are needed to\ndiagnose\ninfantile hemangiomas. If there is something about the tumor that looks unusual, a\nbiopsy\nmay be done. If the hemangioma is deeper inside the body with no change to the skin, or the lesions are spread across a large area of the body, an\nultrasound\nmay be done. Infants with five or more hemangiomas on the skin should have an ultrasound of the liver done to check for a liver hemangioma. See the\nGeneral Information section\nfor a description of these tests and procedures.\nIf the hemangiomas are part of a syndrome, more tests may be done, such as an\nechocardiogram\n,\nMRI\n, magnetic resonance angiogram, and eye exam.\nTreatment\nMost hemangiomas fade and shrink without treatment. If the hemangioma is large or causing other health problems, treatment may include the following:\nPropranolol\nor other\nbeta-blocker\ntherapy\n.\nSteroid therapy\n, before beta-blocker therapy is begun or  when beta-blockers cannot be used.\nLaser surgery\n, including pulsed dye  laser surgery, may be used for hemangiomas that have ulcers or have not completely gone away.\nSurgery\nfor hemangiomas that have ulcers, cause vision problems, or have not completely gone away. Surgery may also be used for lesions on the face that do not\nrespond\nto other treatment.\nTopical\nbeta-blocker therapy for hemangiomas that are in one area of the skin.\nCombined therapy\n, such as propranolol and steroid therapy or propranolol and topical beta-blocker therapy.\nA\nclinical trial\nof propranolol.\nCongenital Hemangioma\nCongenital hemangioma\nis a\nbenign vascular tumor\nthat begins forming before birth and is fully formed when the baby is born. They're usually on the skin but can be in another\norgan\n. A congenital hemangioma may occur as a rash of purple spots and the skin around the spot may be lighter.\nThere are three types of congenital hemangiomas:\nRapidly involuting congenital hemangioma\n: These\ntumors\ngo away on their own 12 to 15 months after birth. They can form\nulcers\n, bleed, and cause temporary heart and\nblood clotting\nproblems. The skin may look a little different even after the hemangiomas go away.\nPartial involuting congenital hemangioma\n: These tumors do not go away completely.\nNon-involuting congenital hemangioma\n: These tumors never go away on their own.\nDiagnostic Tests\nSee the\nGeneral Information section\nfor a description of tests and procedures, such as\nultrasound\n, used to\ndiagnose\ncongenital hemangioma.\nTreatment\nTreatment of rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma and partial involuting congenital hemangioma may include the following:\nObservation\nonly.\nTreatment of non-involuting congenital hemangioma may include the following:\nSurgery\nto remove the\ntumor\n, depending on where it is and whether it is causing\nsymptoms\n.\nBenign Vascular Tumors of the Liver\nBenign vascular tumors\nof the\nliver\nmay be\nfocal\nvascular\nlesions\n(a single lesion in one area of the liver), multiple liver lesions (more than one lesion in one area of the liver), or\ndiffuse\nliver lesions (more than one lesion in more than one area of the liver).\nThe liver has many functions, including filtering\nblood\nand making\nproteins\nneeded for\nblood clotting\n. Sometimes, blood that normally flows through the liver is blocked or slowed by the tumor. This sends blood directly to the heart without going through the liver and is called a liver shunt. This can cause heart failure and problems with blood clotting.\nFocal Vascular Lesions\nFocal vascular lesions are usually rapidly involuting\ncongenital hemangiomas\nor non-involuting congenital hemangiomas.\nDiagnostic Tests\nSee the\nGeneral Information section\nfor a description of tests and procedures used to\ndiagnose\nfocal vascular lesions of the liver.\nTreatment\nTreatment of focal vascular lesions of the liver depends on whether\nsymptoms\noccur and  may include the following:\nObservation\n.\nEmbolization\nof the liver to treat symptoms.\nSurgery\n, for lesions that do not\nrespond\nto other treatments.\nMultiple and Diffuse Liver Lesions\nMultiple  and diffuse lesions of the liver are usually\ninfantile hemangiomas\n. Diffuse lesions of the liver can cause serious effects, including problems with the\nthyroid gland\nand heart. The liver can enlarge, press  on other\norgans\n, and cause more symptoms.\nDiagnostic Tests\nSee the\nGeneral Information section\nfor a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose multiple or diffuse benign vascular lesions.\nTreatment\nTreatment of multiple liver lesions may include the following:\nObservation for lesions that do not cause symptoms.\nBeta-blocker\ntherapy\n(\npropranolol\n) for lesions that begin to grow.\nTreatment of diffuse liver lesions may include the following:\nBeta-blocker therapy (propranolol).\nThyroid hormone replacement therapy.\nChemotherapy\n.\nSteroid therapy\n.\nTotal\nhepatectomy\nand liver\ntransplant\n, when the lesions do not respond to\ndrug therapy\n. This is done only when the lesions have spread widely in the liver and more than one organ has failed.\nIf a vascular lesion of the liver does not respond to\nstandard treatments\n, a\nbiopsy\nmay be done to see if the tumor has become cancer.\nSpindle Cell Hemangioma\nSpindle cell hemangiomas\ncontain\ncells\ncalled spindle cells. Under a\nmicroscope\n, spindle cells look long and slender.\nRisk Factors\nA\nrisk factor\nis anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Not every child with a risk factor will develop spindle cell hemangiomas, and they can develop in some children who don't have a known risk factor. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk. Spindle cell hemangiomas are likely to occur in children with the following\nsyndromes\n:\nMaffucci syndrome\n, which affects\ncartilage\nand skin.\nKlippel-Trenaunay syndrome\n, which affects\nblood vessels\n,\nsoft tissues\n, and bones.\nSigns\nSpindle cell hemangiomas appear on or under  the skin. They are painful red-brown or bluish\nlesions\nthat usually appear on the arms or legs.  They can begin as one lesion and develop into more lesions over years.\nDiagnostic Tests\nSee the\nGeneral Information section\nfor a description of tests and procedures used to\ndiagnose\nspindle cell hemangioma.\nTreatment\nThere is no\nstandard treatment\nfor spindle cell hemangiomas. Treatment  may include the following:\nSurgery\nto remove the\ntumor\n.\nSpindle cell hemangiomas may come back after surgery.\nEpithelioid Hemangioma\nEpithelioid hemangiomas\nusually form on or in the skin, especially the head, but can occur in other areas, such as bone.\nSigns and Symptoms\nEpithelioid hemangiomas are sometimes caused by injury. On the skin, they may appear as firm pink to red bumps and may be itchy. Epithelioid hemangioma of the bone may cause swelling, pain, and weakened bone in the affected area.\nDiagnostic Tests\nSee the\nGeneral Information section\nfor a description of tests and procedures used to\ndiagnose\nepithelioid hemangioma.\nTreatment\nThere is no\nstandard treatment\nfor epithelioid hemangiomas. Treatment may include the following:\nSurgery\n(\ncurettage\nor\nresection\n).\nSclerotherapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nin rare cases.\nEpithelioid hemangiomas often come back after treatment.\nPyogenic Granuloma\nPyogenic granuloma\nis also called lobular capillary hemangioma. It is most common in older children and young adults but may occur at any age.\nThe\nlesions\nare sometimes caused by injury  or from the use  of certain\nmedicines\n, including\nbirth control\npills and\nretinoids\n. They may also form for no known reason inside\ncapillaries\n(the smallest\nblood vessels\n),\narteries\n,\nveins\n, or other places on the body. Some lesions may be associated with\ncapillary malformations\n. Usually there is only one lesion, but sometimes multiple lesions occur in the same area or the lesions may spread to other areas of the body.\nSigns\nPyogenic granulomas are raised, bright red lesions that may be small or large and  smooth or bumpy. They grow quickly over weeks to months and may bleed a lot. These lesions are usually on the surface of the skin, but may form in the\ntissues\nbelow  the skin and look like other vascular lesions.\nDiagnostic Tests\nSee the\nGeneral Information section\nfor a description of tests and procedures used to\ndiagnose\npyogenic granuloma.\nTreatment\nSome pyogenic granulomas go away without treatment.\nOther pyogenic granulomas need treatment that may include the following:\nSurgery\n(\nexcision\nor\ncurettage\n) to remove the lesion.\nPhotocoagulation\n.\nCryotherapy\n.\nTopical\nbeta-blocker therapy (propranolol or timolol).\nPyogenic granulomas often come back after treatment.\nAngiofibroma\nAngiofibromas\nare rare. They are benign skin\nlesions\nthat usually occur with a\ncondition\ncalled\ntuberous sclerosis\n(an\ninherited\ndisorder\nthat causes skin lesions,\nseizures\n,  and mental disabilities).\nSigns\nAngiofibromas appear as red bumps on the face.\nDiagnostic Tests\nSee the\nGeneral Information section\nfor a description of tests and procedures used to\ndiagnose\nangiofibroma.\nTreatment\nTreatment of angiofibromas may include the following:\nSurgery\nto remove the tumor.\nLaser therapy\n.\nTargeted therapy\n(\nsirolimus\n).\nJuvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma\nJuvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas\nare\nbenign tumors\nbut they can grow into nearby\ntissue\n. They begin in the\nnasal\ncavity\nand may  spread to the\nnasopharynx\n, the\nparanasal sinuses\n,  the bone around the eyes, and sometimes to the brain.\nDiagnostic Tests\nSee the\nGeneral Information section\nfor a description of tests and procedures used to\ndiagnose\njuvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma.\nTreatment\nTreatment of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas may include the following:\nSurgery\nto remove the\ntumor\n.\nRadiation therapy\n.\nChemotherapy\n.\nImmunotherapy\n(\ninterferon\n).\nTargeted therapy\n(\nsirolimus\n).\nIntermediate Tumors that May Spread Locally\nIn This Section\nKaposiform Hemangioendothelioma and Tufted Angioma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nKaposiform Hemangioendothelioma and Tufted Angioma\nKaposiform hemangioendotheliomas\nand\ntufted angiomas\nare\nblood vessel\ntumors\nthat occur in infants or young children. These tumors can cause\nKasabach-Merritt\nphenomenon, a\ncondition\nin which the\nblood\nis not able to clot and serious bleeding may occur. In Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon, the tumor traps and destroys\nplatelets\n(\nblood-clotting\ncells\n). Then there aren't enough platelets in the blood when needed to stop bleeding.   This type of\nvascular tumor\nis not related to\nKaposi sarcoma\n.\nSigns and Symptoms\nKaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas usually occur on the skin of the arms and legs, but may also form in deeper\ntissues\n, such as muscle or bone, or in the chest,\nabdomen\n, head, or neck.\nSigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay include the following:\nFirm, painful areas of skin that look bruised.\nPurple or brownish-red areas of skin.\nPain with no visible lump.\nEasy bruising.\nBleeding more than the usual amount from\nmucous membranes\n,\nwounds,\nand other tissues.\nPatients who have kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and tufted angioma may have\nanemia\n(weakness, feeling tired, or looking pale).\nDiagnostic Tests\nSee the\nGeneral Information section\nfor a description of tests and procedures used to\ndiagnose\nkaposiform hemangioendothelioma and tufted angioma.\nIf a\nphysical exam\nand\nMRI\nclearly show the tumor is  a kaposiform hemangioendothelioma or a tufted angioma, a\nbiopsy\nmay not be needed. A biopsy is not always done because serious bleeding can occur.\nTreatment\nTreatment of kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas depends on the child's symptoms.\nInfection\n, delay in treatment,  and\nsurgery\ncan cause bleeding that is life-threatening. Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas are best treated by a  vascular anomaly\nspecialist\n.\nTreatment for uncomplicated kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas may include the following:\nObservation\n.\nSurgery\nto remove the\ntumor\n.\nLaser surgery\n.\nTopical\ntherapy\n(\nsteroids\nor\ntacrolimus\n).\nBeta-blocker\ntherapy (\npropranolol\n).\nTargeted therapy\n(\nsirolimus\n).\nTreatment for complicated kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas may include the following:\nChemotherapy\n, with or without\nsteroid therapy\n.\nTargeted therapy (sirolimus), with or without steroid therapy.\nSurgery, with or without\nembolization\n.\nEven with treatment, these tumors  do not fully go away and can come back. Pain and\ninflammation\nmay get worse with age, often around the time of\npuberty\n. Long-term effects include\nchronic pain\n, heart failure, bone problems, and\nlymphedema\n(the build up of\nlymph fluid\nin tissues).\nIntermediate Tumors that May Spread to Other Parts of the Body\nIn This Section\nPseudomyogenic (Epithelioid Sarcoma–Like) Hemangioendothelioma\nRetiform Hemangioendothelioma\nPapillary Intralymphatic Angioendothelioma\nComposite Hemangioendothelioma\nKaposi Sarcoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nPseudomyogenic (Epithelioid Sarcoma–Like) Hemangioendothelioma\nPseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma\ncan occur in children, but is most common in men aged 20 to 50 years.

        "context": "Description\nDOLK\n-congenital disorder of glycosylation (\nDOLK\n-CDG, formerly known as congenital disorder of glycosylation type Im) is an inherited condition that often affects the heart but can also involve other body systems. The pattern and severity of this disorder's signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals.\nIndividuals with\nDOLK\n-CDG typically develop signs and symptoms of the condition during infancy or early childhood. Nearly all individuals with\nDOLK\n-CDG develop a weakened and enlarged heart (\ndilated cardiomyopathy\n). Other frequent signs and symptoms include recurrent seizures; developmental delay; poor muscle tone (hypotonia); and dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis). Less commonly, affected individuals can have distinctive facial features, kidney disease, hormonal abnormalities, or eye problems.\nIndividuals with\nDOLK\n-CDG typically do not survive into adulthood, often because of complications related to dilated cardiomyopathy, and some do not survive past infancy.\nFrequency\nDOLK\n-CDG is likely a rare condition; at least 18 cases have been reported in the scientific literature.\nCauses\nDOLK\n-CDG is caused by mutations in the\nDOLK\ngene. This gene provides instructions for making the enzyme dolichol kinase, which facilitates the final step of the production of a compound called dolichol phosphate. This compound is critical for a process called glycosylation, which attaches groups of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) to proteins. Glycosylation changes proteins in ways that are important for their functions. During glycosylation, sugars are added to dolichol phosphate in order to build the oligosaccharide chain. Once the chain is formed, dolichol phosphate transports the oligosaccharide to the protein that needs to be glycosylated and attaches it to a specific site on the protein.\nMutations in the\nDOLK\ngene lead to the production of abnormal dolichol kinase with reduced or absent activity. Without properly functioning dolichol kinase, dolichol phosphate is not produced and glycosylation cannot proceed normally. In particular, a protein known to stabilize\nheart muscle fibers\n, called alpha-dystroglycan, has been shown to have reduced glycosylation in people with\nDOLK\n-CDG. Impaired glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan disrupts its normal function, which damages heart muscle fibers as they repeatedly contract and relax. Over time, the fibers weaken and break down, leading to\ndilated cardiomyopathy\n. The other signs and symptoms of\nDOLK\n-CDG are likely due to the abnormal glycosylation of additional proteins in other organs and tissues.\nLearn more about the gene associated with DOLK-congenital disorder of glycosylation\nDOLK\nInheritance\nThis condition is inherited in an\nautosomal recessive pattern\n, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\nOther Names for This Condition\nCDG1M\nCongenital disorder of glycosylation, type Im\nDK1 deficiency\nDolichol kinase deficiency\nDOLK-CDG\n",

        "question": "What are the genetic changes related to 9q22.3 microdeletion ?",
        "right_answer": "People with a 9q22.3 microdeletion are missing a sequence of at least 352,000 DNA building blocks (base pairs), also written as 352 kilobases (kb), in the q22.3 region of chromosome 9. This 352-kb segment is known as the minimum critical region because it is the smallest deletion that has been found to cause the signs and symptoms described above. 9q22.3 microdeletions can also be much larger; the largest reported deletion includes 20.5 million base pairs (20.5 Mb). 9q22.3 microdeletion affects one of the two copies of chromosome 9 in each cell.  People with a 9q22.3 microdeletion are missing from two to more than 270 genes on chromosome 9. All known 9q22.3 microdeletions include the PTCH1 gene. The protein produced from this gene, patched-1, acts as a tumor suppressor, which means it keeps cells from growing and dividing (proliferating) too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.

        "context": "Description\n9q22.3 microdeletion is a chromosomal change in which a small piece of chromosome 9 is\ndeleted\nin each cell. The deletion occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome in a region designated q22.3. This chromosomal change is associated with delayed development, intellectual disability, certain physical abnormalities, and the characteristic features of a genetic condition called\nGorlin syndrome\n.\nMany individuals with a 9q22.3 microdeletion have delayed development, particularly affecting the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. In some people, the delays are temporary and improve in childhood. More severely affected individuals have permanent developmental disabilities along with intellectual impairment and learning problems. Rarely, seizures have been reported in people with a 9q22.3 microdeletion.\nAbout 20 percent of people with a 9q22.3 microdeletion experience overgrowth (macrosomia), which results in increased height and weight compared to unaffected peers. The macrosomia often begins before birth and continues into childhood. Other physical changes that are sometimes associated with a 9q22.3 microdeletion include the premature fusion of certain bones in the skull (metopic craniosynostosis) and a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). Affected individuals can also have distinctive facial features such as a prominent forehead  with vertical skin creases, upward- or downward-slanting eyes, a short nose, and a long space between the nose and upper lip (philtrum).\n9q22.3 microdeletions also cause the characteristic features of Gorlin syndrome (also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome). This genetic condition affects many areas of the body and increases the risk of developing various cancerous and noncancerous tumors. In people with Gorlin syndrome, the type of cancer diagnosed most often is\nbasal cell carcinoma\n, which is the most common form of skin cancer. Most people with this condition also develop noncancerous (benign) tumors of the jaw, called keratocystic odontogenic tumors, which can cause facial swelling and tooth displacement. Other types of tumors that occur in some people with Gorlin syndrome include a form of childhood brain cancer called a medulloblastoma and a type of benign tumor called a fibroma that occurs in the heart or in a woman's ovaries. Other features of Gorlin syndrome include small depressions (pits) in the skin of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; an unusually large head size (\nmacrocephaly\n) with a prominent forehead; and skeletal abnormalities involving the spine, ribs, or skull.\nFrequency\n9q22.3 microdeletion appears to be a rare chromosomal change. About three dozen affected individuals have been reported in the medical literature.\nCauses\nPeople with a 9q22.3 microdeletion are\nmissing\na sequence of at least 352,000 DNA building blocks (base pairs), also written as 352 kilobases (kb), in the q22.3 region of\nchromosome 9\n. This 352-kb segment is known as the minimum critical region because it is the smallest deletion that has been found to cause the signs and symptoms described above. 9q22.3 microdeletions can also be much larger; the largest reported deletion includes 20.5 million base pairs (20.5 Mb). 9q22.3 microdeletion affects one of the two copies of chromosome 9 in each cell.\nPeople with a 9q22.3 microdeletion are missing from two to more than 270 genes on chromosome 9. All known 9q22.3 microdeletions include the\nPTCH1\ngene. The protein produced from this gene, patched-1, acts as a tumor suppressor, which means it keeps cells from growing and dividing (proliferating) too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Researchers believe that many of the features associated with 9q22.3 microdeletions, particularly the signs and symptoms of Gorlin syndrome, result from a loss of the\nPTCH1\ngene.

In these cases, the deletion occurs as a\nrandom (de novo) event\nduring the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) in a parent or in early embryonic development. De novo chromosomal changes occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\nLess commonly, individuals with a 9q22.3 microdeletion inherit the chromosomal change from an unaffected parent. In these cases, the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a\nbalanced translocation\n, in which a segment of chromosome 9 has traded places with a segment of another chromosome. No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. However, translocations can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. People who inherit a 9q22.3 microdeletion receive an\nunbalanced translocation\nthat deletes genetic material from one copy of the q22.3 region of chromosome 9 in each cell.\nHaving one missing copy of the\nPTCH1\ngene in each cell is enough to cause the features of Gorlin syndrome that are present early in life, including macrocephaly and skeletal abnormalities. For basal cell carcinomas and other tumors to develop, a mutation in the other copy of the\nPTCH1\ngene must also occur in certain cells during the person's lifetime. Most people who are born with one missing copy of the\nPTCH1\ngene eventually acquire a mutation in the other copy of the gene in some cells and consequently develop various types of tumors.\nOther Names for This Condition\n9q22 deletion syndrome\n9q22.3 deletion\nMicrodeletion 9q22.3 syndrome\n",

Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtDNA mutations from their mother. These disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtDNA to their children.",
        "context": "Description\nKearns-Sayre syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body, especially the eyes. The features of Kearns-Sayre syndrome usually appear before age 20, and the condition is diagnosed by a few characteristic signs and symptoms. People with Kearns-Sayre syndrome have\nprogressive external ophthalmoplegia\n, which is weakness or paralysis of the eye muscles that impairs eye movement and causes drooping eyelids (\nptosis\n). Affected individuals also have an eye condition called pigmentary retinopathy, which results from breakdown (degeneration) of the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eye (the\nretina\n) that gives it a speckled and streaked appearance. The retinopathy may cause loss of vision. In addition, people with Kearns-Sayre syndrome have at least one of the following signs or symptoms: abnormalities of the electrical signals that control the heartbeat (cardiac conduction defects), problems with coordination and balance that cause unsteadiness while walking (ataxia), or abnormally high levels of protein in the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord (the\ncerebrospinal fluid\nor CSF).\nPeople with Kearns-Sayre syndrome may also experience muscle weakness in their limbs, deafness, kidney problems, or a deterioration of cognitive functions (dementia). Affected individuals often have short stature. In addition, diabetes mellitus is occasionally seen in people with Kearns-Sayre syndrome.\nWhen the muscle cells of affected individuals are stained and viewed under a microscope, these cells usually appear abnormal. The abnormal muscle cells contain an excess of structures called mitochondria and are known as ragged-red fibers.\nA related condition called ophthalmoplegia-plus may be diagnosed if an individual has many of the signs and symptoms of Kearns-Sayre syndrome but not all the criteria are met.\nFrequency\nThe prevalence of Kearns-Sayre syndrome is approximately 1 to 3 per 100,000 individuals.\nCauses\nKearns-Sayre syndrome is a condition caused by defects in\nmitochondria\n, which are structures within cells that use oxygen to convert the energy from food into a form cells can use. This process is called\noxidative phosphorylation\n. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus (nuclear DNA), mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA, called\nmitochondrial DNA\n(mtDNA). This type of DNA contains many genes essential for normal mitochondrial function. People with Kearns-Sayre syndrome have a single, large deletion of mtDNA, ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 DNA building blocks (nucleotides). The cause of the deletion in affected individuals is unknown.\nThe mtDNA deletions that cause Kearns-Sayre syndrome result in the loss of genes important for mitochondrial protein formation and oxidative phosphorylation. The most common deletion removes 4,997 nucleotides, which includes twelve mitochondrial genes. Deletions of mtDNA result in impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and a decrease in cellular energy production. Regardless of which genes are deleted, all steps of oxidative phosphorylation are affected. Researchers have not determined how these deletions lead to the specific signs and symptoms of Kearns-Sayre syndrome, although the features of the condition are probably related to a lack of cellular energy. It has been suggested that eyes are commonly affected by mitochondrial defects because they are especially dependent on mitochondria for energy.\nLearn more about the chromosome associated with Kearns-Sayre syndrome\nmitochondrial dna\nInheritance\nThis condition is generally not inherited but arises from mutations in the body's cells that occur after conception.

Elastin is the major component of elastic fibers, which are slender bundles of proteins that provide strength and flexibility to\nconnective tissue\n(tissue that supports the body's joints and organs). Elastic fibers are found in the intricate lattice that forms in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix), where they give structural support to organs and tissues such as\nthe heart\n, skin, lungs, ligaments, and\nblood vessels\n. Elastic fibers make up approximately 50 percent of\nthe aorta\n, the rest being primarily muscle cells called vascular smooth muscle cells that line the aorta. Together, elastic fibers and vascular smooth muscle cells provide flexibility and resilience to the aorta.\nMost of the\nELN\ngene mutations that cause SVAS lead to a decrease in the production of tropoelastin. A shortage of tropoelastin reduces the amount of mature elastin protein that is processed and available for forming elastic fibers. As a result, elastic fibers that make up the aorta are thinner than normal. To compensate, the smooth muscle cells that line the aorta increase in number, making the aorta thicker and narrower than usual. A thickened aorta is less flexible and resilient to the stress of constant blood flow and pumping of the heart. Over time, the wall of the aorta can become damaged. Aortic narrowing causes the heart to work harder to pump blood through the aorta, resulting in the signs and symptoms of SVAS.\nLearn more about the gene associated with Supravalvular aortic stenosis\nELN\nInheritance\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

        "question": "What is (are) Laron syndrome ?",
        "right_answer": "Laron syndrome is a rare form of short stature that results from the body's inability to use growth hormone, a substance produced by the brain's pituitary gland that helps promote growth. Affected individuals are close to normal size at birth, but they experience slow growth from early childhood that results in very short stature. If the condition is not treated, adult males typically reach a maximum height of about 4.5 feet; adult females may be just over 4 feet tall.  Other features of untreated Laron syndrome include reduced muscle strength and endurance, low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) in infancy, small genitals and delayed puberty, hair that is thin and fragile, and dental abnormalities. Many affected individuals have a distinctive facial appearance, including a protruding forehead, a sunken bridge of the nose (saddle nose), and a blue tint to the whites of the eyes (blue sclerae). Affected individuals have short limbs compared to the size of their torso, as well as small hands and feet. Adults with this condition tend to develop obesity. However, the signs and symptoms of Laron syndrome vary, even among affected members of the same family.  Studies suggest that people with Laron syndrome have a significantly reduced risk of cancer and type 2 diabetes. Affected individuals appear to develop these common diseases much less frequently than their unaffected relatives, despite having obesity (a risk factor for both cancer and type 2 diabetes).

Affected individuals appear to develop these common diseases much less frequently than their unaffected relatives, despite having obesity (a risk factor for both cancer and type 2 diabetes). However, people with Laron syndrome do not seem to have an increased lifespan compared with their unaffected relatives.\nFrequency\nLaron syndrome is a rare disorder. About 350 people have been diagnosed with the condition worldwide. The largest single group of affected individuals (about 100 people) lives in an area of southern Ecuador.\nCauses\nLaron syndrome is caused by mutations in the\nGHR\ngene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called the\ngrowth hormone receptor\n. The receptor is present on the\nouter membrane\nof cells throughout the body, particularly liver cells. As its name suggests, the growth hormone receptor attaches (binds) to growth hormone; the two proteins fit together like a key in a lock. When growth hormone is bound to its receptor, it triggers\nsignaling\nthat stimulates the growth and division of cells. This signaling also leads to the production, primarily by liver cells, of another important growth-promoting hormone called insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I).\nGrowth hormone and IGF-I have a wide variety of effects on the growth and function of many parts of the body. For example, these hormones stimulate the growth and division of cells called chondrocytes, which play a critical role in producing new bone tissue. Growth hormone and IGF-I also influence metabolism, including how the body uses and stores carbohydrates, proteins, and fats from food.\nMutations in the\nGHR\ngene impair the receptor's ability to bind to growth hormone or to trigger signaling within cells. As a result, even when growth hormone is available, cells are unable to respond by producing IGF-I and stimulating growth and division. The cells' inability to react to growth hormone, which is described as growth hormone insensitivity, disrupts the normal growth and function of many different tissues. Short stature results when growth hormone cannot adequately stimulate the growth of bones. Changes in metabolism caused by insensitivity to growth hormone and the resulting shortage of IGF-I cause many of the other features of the condition, including obesity.\nResearchers are working to determine how mutations in the\nGHR\ngene may protect people with Laron syndrome from developing cancer and type 2 diabetes. Studies suggest that insensitivity to growth hormone may help prevent the uncontrolled growth and division of cells that can lead to the development of cancerous tumors. Growth hormone insensitivity also appears to alter how the body responds to\ninsulin\n, which is a hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. Resistance to the effects of insulin is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. People with Laron syndrome have the opposite situation, an increased sensitivity to insulin, which likely helps explain their reduced risk of this common disease.\nLearn more about the gene associated with Laron syndrome\nGHR\nInheritance\nMost cases of Laron syndrome are inherited in an\nautosomal recessive pattern\n, which means both copies of the\nGHR\ngene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\nMuch less commonly, the condition has an\nautosomal dominant pattern\nof inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most of these cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.\nOther Names for This Condition\nGH-R deficiency\nGrowth hormone insensitivity syndrome\nGrowth hormone receptor defect\nGrowth hormone receptor deficiency\nLaron dwarfism\nLaron-type dwarfism\nLaron-type isolated somatotropin defect\nLaron-type pituitary dwarfism\nLaron-type short stature\nPituitary dwarfism II\nPrimary GH resistance\nPrimary growth hormone resistance\nSevere GH insensitivity\n",

The best-studied of these genes is\nMTHFR\n, which provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in processing the vitamin folate (also called vitamin B9). While a shortage (deficiency) of this vitamin is an established risk factor for neural tube defects, there are many factors that can contribute to folate deficiency.

However, no genes appear to play a major role in causing the condition.\nResearchers have also examined environmental factors that could contribute to the risk of anencephaly. Folate deficiency plays a significant role. Studies have shown that women who take supplements containing folic acid (the synthetic form of folate) before they get pregnant and very early in their pregnancy are significantly less likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect, including anencephaly. Other possible maternal risk factors for anencephaly include diabetes mellitus, obesity, exposure to high heat (such as a fever or use of a hot tub or sauna) in early pregnancy, and the use of certain anti-seizure medications during pregnancy.

Two of the 46 chromosomes, known as X and Y, are called\nsex chromosomes\nbecause they help determine whether a person will develop male-typical or female-typical sex characteristics. Females usually have two X chromosomes (46,XX), and males usually have one\nX chromosome\nand one\nY chromosome\n(46,XY).\nThe\nSRY\ngene, normally located on the Y chromosome, provides instructions for making the sex-determining region Y protein. The sex-determining region Y protein causes a fetus to develop as a male.\nIn about 80 percent of individuals with 46,XX testicular difference of sex development, the condition results from an abnormal exchange of genetic material between chromosomes (\ntranslocation\n). This exchange occurs as a random event during the formation of\nsperm cells\nin the affected person's father. The translocation causes the\nSRY\ngene to be misplaced, almost always onto an X chromosome. If a fetus is conceived from a sperm cell with an X chromosome bearing the\nSRY\ngene, it will develop as a male despite not having a Y chromosome. This form of the condition is called\nSRY\n-positive 46,XX testicular difference of sex development.\nAbout 20 percent of people with 46,XX testicular difference of sex development do not have the\nSRY\ngene. This form of the condition is called\nSRY\n-negative 46,XX testicular differenceÂ of sex development. The cause of the condition in these individuals is often unknown, although changes affecting other genes involved in the development of sex characteristics have been identified in a small number of people with the condition. Individuals with\nSRY\n-negative 46,XX testicular differenceÂ of sex development are more likely to have  genitalia that do not clearly look male or female than are people with the\nSRY\n-positive form.\nLearn more about the genes and chromosomes associated with 46,XX testicular difference of sex development\nNR5A1\nSOX9\nSRY\nWT1\nx chromosome\ny chromosome\nAdditional Information from NCBI Gene:\nSOX3\nInheritance\nSRY\n-positive 46,XX testicular difference of sex development is almost never inherited. This condition results from the\ntranslocation\nof a Y chromosome segment containing the\nSRY\ngene during the formation of\nsperm\n(spermatogenesis). Affected people typically have no history of the condition in their family and cannot pass on the condition because they are infertile.\nIn rare cases, the\nSRY\ngene may be misplaced onto a chromosome other than the X chromosome. This translocation may be carried by an unaffected father and passed on to a child with two X chromosomes, resulting in 46,XX testicular difference of sex development. In another very rare situation, a male may carry the\nSRY\ngene on both the X and Y chromosome; a child who inherits his X chromosome will develop male sex characteristics despite having no Y chromosome.\nThe inheritance pattern of\nSRY\n-negative 46,XX testicular difference of sex development is variable. In affected people with a known genetic cause, the condition often follows an\nautosomal dominant\npattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In some cases, the genetic variant (also known as a mutation) is inherited from an unaffected parent. Usually, the variant is inherited from an unaffected father. Sometimes, the variant is inherited from an unaffected mother. When some people with the variant do not develop features of the condition, it is said to have reduced (or incomplete) penetrance.\nOther cases of\nSRY\n-negative 46,XX testicular difference of sex development result from\nnew (de novo) variants\nin the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. These cases occur in people with no history of the condition in their family.\nThe inheritance pattern of\nSRY\n-negative 46,XX testicular differenceÂ of sex development without an identified genetic cause is unknown. A few families Â with unaffected parents have had more than one child with the condition, suggesting the possibility of\nautosomal recessive\ninheritance. Autosomal recessive means both copies of a gene in each cell have variants. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\nOther Names for This Condition\n46,XX testicular disorder of sex development\n46,XX testicular DSD\nnonsyndromic 46,XX testicular disorder/difference of sex development\nXX male syndrome\n",

The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.",
        "context": "Description\nPontocerebellar hypoplasia is a group of related conditions that affect the development of the brain. The term \"pontocerebellar\" refers to the pons and the cerebellum, which are the brain structures that are most severely affected in many forms of this disorder. The pons is located at the base of the brain in an area called the\nbrainstem\n, where it transmits signals between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain. The cerebellum, which is located at the back of the brain, normally coordinates movement. The term \"hypoplasia\" refers to the underdevelopment of these brain regions.\nPontocerebellar hypoplasia also causes impaired growth of other parts of the brain, leading to an unusually small head size (\nmicrocephaly\n). This microcephaly is usually not apparent at birth but becomes noticeable as brain growth continues to be slow in infancy and early childhood.\nResearchers have described at least ten types of pontocerebellar hypoplasia. All forms of this condition are characterized by impaired brain development, delayed development overall, problems with movement, and intellectual disability. The brain abnormalities are usually present at birth, and in some cases they can be detected before birth. Many children with pontocerebellar hypoplasia live only into infancy or childhood, although some affected individuals have lived into adulthood.\nThe two major forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia are designated as type 1 (PCH1) and type 2 (PCH2). In addition to the brain abnormalities described above, PCH1 causes problems with muscle movement resulting from a loss of specialized nerve cells called motor neurons in the spinal cord, similar to another genetic disorder known as\nspinal muscular atrophy\n. Individuals with PCH1 also have very weak muscle tone (hypotonia), joint deformities called contractures, vision impairment, and breathing and feeding problems that are evident from early infancy.\nCommon features of PCH2 include a lack of voluntary motor skills (such as grasping objects, sitting, or walking), problems with swallowing (dysphagia), and an absence of communication, including speech. Affected children typically develop temporary jitteriness (generalized clonus) in early infancy, abnormal patterns of movement described as chorea or dystonia, and stiffness (spasticity). Many also have impaired vision and seizures.\nThe other forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia, designated as type 3 (PCH3) through type 10 (PCH10), appear to be rare and have each been reported in only a small number of individuals. Because the different types have overlapping features, and some are caused by mutations in the same genes, researchers have proposed that the types be considered as a spectrum instead of distinct conditions.\nFrequency\nThe prevalence of pontocerebellar hypoplasia is unknown, although most forms of the disorder appear to be very rare.\nCauses\nPontocerebellar hypoplasia can result from mutations in several genes. About half of all cases of PCH1 are caused by mutations in the\nEXOSC3\ngene. PCH1 can also result from mutations in several other genes, including\nTSEN54\n,\nRARS2\n, and\nVRK1\n. PCH2 is caused by mutations in the\nTSEN54\n,\nTSEN2\n,\nTSEN34\n, or\nSEPSECS\ngene. In addition to causing PCH1 and PCH2, mutations in the\nTSEN54\ngene can cause PCH4 and PCH5. Mutations in the\nRARS2\ngene, in addition to causing PCH1, can result in PCH6. The remaining types of pontocerebellar hypoplasia are caused by mutations in other genes. In some cases, the genetic cause of pontocerebellar hypoplasia is unknown.\nThe genes associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia appear to play essential roles in the development and survival of nerve cells (\nneurons\n). Many of these genes are known or suspected to be involved in processing RNA molecules, which are chemical cousins of DNA. Fully processed, mature RNA molecules are essential for the normal functioning of all cells, including neurons. Studies suggest that abnormal RNA processing likely underlies the abnormal brain development characteristic of pontocerebellar hypoplasia, although the exact mechanism is unknown. Researchers hypothesize that developing neurons in certain areas of the brain may be particularly sensitive to problems with RNA processing.\nSome of the genes associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia have functions unrelated to RNA processing. In most cases, it is unclear how mutations in these genes impair brain development.\nLearn more about the genes associated with Pontocerebellar hypoplasia\nEXOSC3\nRARS2\nSEPSECS\nTSEN2\nTSEN34\nTSEN54\nVRK1\nAdditional Information from NCBI Gene:\nAMPD2\nCHMP1A\nCLP1\nInheritance\nThis condition is inherited in an\nautosomal recessive pattern\n, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

Cartilage is a tough but flexible tissue that covers the ends of the bones at joints and is also part of the developing skeleton. A characteristic feature of familial osteochondritis dissecans is areas of bone damage (lesions) caused by detachment of cartilage and a piece of the underlying bone from the end of the bone at a joint. People with this condition develop multiple lesions that affect several joints, primarily the knees, elbows, hips, and ankles. The lesions cause stiffness, pain, and swelling in the joint. Often, the affected joint feels like it catches or locks during movement. Other characteristic features of familial osteochondritis dissecans include short stature and development of a joint disorder called\nosteoarthritis\nat an early age. Osteoarthritis is characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and the underlying bone. It causes pain and stiffness and restricts the movement of joints.\nA similar condition called sporadic osteochondritis dissecans is associated with a single lesion in one joint, most often the knee. These cases may be caused by injury to or repetitive use of the joint (often sports-related).

        "context": "Description\nParamyotonia congenita is a disorder that affects muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). Beginning in infancy or early childhood, people with this condition experience bouts of sustained muscle tensing (myotonia) that prevent muscles from relaxing normally. Myotonia causes muscle stiffness that typically appears after exercise and can be induced by muscle cooling. This stiffness chiefly affects muscles in the face, neck, arms, and hands, although it can also affect muscles used for breathing and muscles in the lower body. Unlike many other forms of myotonia, the muscle stiffness associated with paramyotonia congenita tends to worsen with repeated movements.\nMost peopleâeven those without muscle diseaseâfeel that their muscles do not work as well when they are cold. This effect is dramatic in people with paramyotonia congenita. Exposure to cold initially causes muscle stiffness in these individuals, and prolonged cold exposure leads to temporary episodes of mild to severe muscle weakness that may last for several hours at a time. Some older people with paramyotonia congenita develop permanent muscle weakness that can be disabling.\nFrequency\nParamyotonia congenita is an uncommon disorder; it is estimated to affect fewer than 1 in 100,000 people.\nCauses\nMutations in the\nSCN4A\ngene cause paramyotonia congenita. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is critical for the normal function of skeletal muscle cells. For the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of positively charged atoms (ions), including sodium, into skeletal muscle cells. The SCN4A protein forms\nchannels\nthat control the flow of sodium ions into these cells.\nMutations in the\nSCN4A\ngene alter the usual structure and function of sodium channels.

The symptoms of this disorder usually become noticeable in a person's fifties or sixties, and affected people survive about 3 to 21 years after the appearance of symptoms.\nChanges in personality and behavior are the most common early signs of\nCHMP2B\n-related frontotemporal dementia. These changes include inappropriate emotional responses, restlessness, loss of initiative, and neglect of personal hygiene. Affected individuals may overeat sweet foods or place non-food items into their mouths (hyperorality). Additionally, it may become difficult for affected individuals to interact with others in a socially appropriate manner. They increasingly require help with personal care and other activities of daily living.\nMany people with\nCHMP2B\n-related frontotemporal dementia develop progressive problems with speech and language (aphasia).

Affected infants often have difficulty gaining weight and growing at the expected rate (failure to thrive), developmental delay, liver and kidney problems, and thinning of the bones (\nosteoporosis\n). Some affected individuals develop cholestasis, which is a reduced ability to produce and release a digestive fluid called bile.

Myosin Vb also plays a role in moving components from the\ncell membrane\nto the interior of the cell for recycling.\nMYO5B\ngene mutations that cause microvillus inclusion disease result in a decrease or absence of myosin Vb function. In cells that line the small intestine (enterocytes), a lack of myosin Vb function changes the cell polarity. As a result, enterocytes cannot properly form structures called\nmicrovilli\n, which normally project like small fingers from the surface of the cells and absorb nutrients and fluids from food as it passes through the intestine. Inside affected enterocytes, small clumps of abnormal microvilli mix with misplaced digestive proteins to form microvillus inclusions, which contribute to the dysfunction of enterocytes. Disorganized enterocytes with poorly formed microvilli reduce the intestine's ability to take in nutrients.

        "right_answer": "When you are pregnant, you are not just \"eating for two.\" You also breathe and drink for two, so it is important to carefully consider what you give to your baby. If you smoke, use alcohol or take illegal drugs, so does your unborn baby.    First, don't smoke. Smoking during pregnancy passes nicotine and cancer-causing drugs to your baby. Smoke also keeps your baby from getting nourishment and raises the risk of stillbirth or premature birth. Don't drink alcohol. There is no known safe amount of alcohol a woman can drink while pregnant. Alcohol can cause life-long physical and behavioral problems in children, including fetal alcohol syndrome. Don't use illegal drugs. Using illegal drugs may cause underweight babies, birth defects or withdrawal symptoms after birth.    If you are pregnant and you smoke, drink alcohol or do drugs, get help. Your health care provider can recommend programs to help you quit. You and your baby will be better off.    Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health",
        "context": "Summary\nDuring\npregnancy\n, there are many things you can do to keep yourself and your baby healthy. They include getting regular\nprenatal care\n,\neating healthy\n, and staying active. But it's also very important to avoid substances that could be harmful to you and your baby, such as tobacco, alcohol, and drugs.\nTobacco\nSmoking\nduring pregnancy passes nicotine,\ncarbon monoxide\n, and many other harmful chemicals to your baby. Nicotine is not only a health danger for you, but it can also damage your developing baby's brain and lungs. Carbon monoxide can keep the developing baby from getting enough oxygen.\nIf you smoke while pregnant, it raises the risk of your baby being born\ntoo small\n,\ntoo early\n, or with\nbirth defects\n. During the first year of life, there is a higher risk of your baby dying from\nsudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS). And later in life, your child may be more likely to have health problems, such as\nasthma\nand\nobesity\n.\nOther tobacco products, including\ne-cigarettes\n, also contain nicotine and are not safe to use during pregnancy. And some of the flavorings used in e-cigarettes may be harmful to developing babies.\nYou will also want to try to avoid\nsecondhand smoke\n, which has some of the same risks as smoking during pregnancy.\nAlcohol\nThere is no known amount of alcohol that is safe for you to drink during pregnancy and while trying to get pregnant. All types of alcohol are equally harmful, including all wines and beer. The risks from drinking during pregnancy include problems with the growth of the developing baby and\nfetal alcohol spectrum disorders\n(FASD). FASD is a life-long condition that can cause a mix of physical, behavioral, and learning problems.\nIllegal drugs\nUsing illegal drugs, such as\ncocaine\n,\nmethamphetamines\n, and\nclub drugs\n, during pregnancy can cause problems for both you and your baby. They may cause low birth weight babies, birth defects, or\nmiscarriage\n. Your child may be more likely to have\nlearning\nand\ndevelopmental\ndisabilities. And if you are injecting the drugs, that puts you at risk for\nHIV\n. HIV can be\npassed along to your baby during pregnancy\n.\nPrescription drug misuse\nMisusing\nprescription drugs\ncan also be harmful. Misuse can include taking more than your prescribed dose or taking it more often, using it to get high, or taking someone else's medicines. The possible effects of misusing a medicine during pregnancy will depend on which medicine you are misusing.\nOpioids\nOne type of drug that is a concern during pregnancy is\nopioids\n. Opioids include strong prescription\npain relievers\nsuch as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug\nheroin\nis also an opioid. Taking\nopioids during pregnancy\ncan cause problems for you and your baby. The risks include birth defects, preterm birth, the loss of the baby, and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS causes withdrawal symptoms in newborn babies.\nIf you have pain and your health care provider suggests that you take prescription opioids during pregnancy, first discuss the risks and benefits with the provider. Then if you both decide that you need to take the opioids, you can work together to try to minimize the risks.\nCannabis (marijuana)\nCannabis (marijuana)\nis another drug that could be harmful to your baby. Some research shows that using cannabis during pregnancy is linked to developmental problems in children and teens. More research is needed, but the safest thing to do is stop using it if you are pregnant. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that people should not use cannabis while they are pregnant.\nGetting help\nIf you are pregnant and using any of these substances, contact your provider. Together you and your provider can find the right treatment to help you quit.\nIf you are taking opioids or are addicted to drugs, don't stop taking them suddenly. That can be dangerous to you and the baby. Instead, contact your provider for help with getting off the drugs safely.\n",

        "question": "What is (are) Tooth Decay ?",
        "right_answer": "You call it a cavity. Your dentist calls it tooth decay or dental caries. They're all names for a hole in your tooth. The cause of tooth decay is plaque, a sticky substance in your mouth made up mostly of germs. Tooth decay starts in the outer layer, called the enamel. Without a filling, the decay can get deep into the tooth and its nerves and cause a toothache or abscess.    To help prevent cavities       - Brush your teeth every day with a fluoride toothpaste    - Clean between your teeth every day with floss or another type of between-the-teeth cleaner    - Snack smart - limit sugary snacks    - See your dentist or oral health professional regularly",
        "context": "Summary\nWhat is tooth decay?\nTooth decay is damage to a tooth's surface, or enamel. It happens when bacteria in your mouth make acids that attack the enamel. Tooth decay can lead to cavities (dental caries), which are holes in your teeth. If tooth decay is not treated, it can cause pain, infection, and even tooth loss.\nWhat causes tooth decay?\nOur mouths are full of bacteria. Some bacteria are helpful. But some can be harmful, including the ones that play a role in tooth decay. These bacteria combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque. The bacteria in plaque use the sugar and starch in what you eat and drink to make acids. The acids begin to eat away at the minerals on your enamel. Over time, the plaque can harden into tartar. Besides damaging your teeth, plaque and tartar can also irritate your gums and cause\ngum disease\n.\nYou get fluoride from toothpaste, water, and other sources. This fluoride, along with your salvia, helps the enamel repair itself by replacing the minerals. Your teeth go through this natural process of losing minerals and regaining minerals all day long. But if you don't take care of your teeth and/or you eat and drink lots of sugary or starchy things, your enamel will keep losing minerals. This leads to tooth decay.\nA white spot may appear where minerals have been lost. This is an early sign of tooth decay. You may be able to stop or reverse the decay at this point. Your enamel can still repair itself, if you take better care of your teeth and limit sugary/starchy foods and drinks.\nBut if the tooth decay process continues, more minerals are lost. Over time, the enamel is weakened and destroyed, forming a cavity. A cavity is a hole in your tooth. It is permanent damage that a dentist has to repair with a filling.\nWho is at risk for tooth decay?\nThe main risk factors for tooth decay are not taking care of your teeth and having too many sugary or starchy foods and drinks.\nSome people have a higher risk of tooth decay, including people who:\nDon't have enough saliva, because of medicines, certain diseases, or some cancer treatments\nDon't get enough fluoride\nAre very young. Babies and toddlers who drink from bottles are at risk, especially if they are given juice or get bottles at bedtime. This exposes their teeth to sugars for long periods of time.\nAre older. Many older adults have receding gums and more wear on their teeth. These raise the risk of decay on the exposed root surfaces of their teeth.\nWhat are the symptoms of tooth decay and cavities?\nIn early tooth decay, you usually don't have symptoms. As tooth decay gets worse, it can cause:\nA toothache (tooth pain)\nTooth sensitivity to sweets, hot, or cold\nWhite or brown stains on the surface of a tooth\nA cavity\nAn infection, which can lead to an\nabscess\n(pocket of pus) forming. The abscess can cause pain, facial swelling, and fever.\nHow are tooth decay and cavities diagnosed?\nDentists usually find tooth decay and cavities by looking at your teeth and probing them with dental instruments. Your dentist will also ask if you have any symptoms. Sometimes you may need a dental x-ray.\nWhat are the treatments for tooth decay and cavities?\nThere are several treatments for tooth decay and cavities. Which treatment you get depends on how bad the problem is:\nFluoride treatments.\nIf you have early tooth decay, a fluoride treatment can help the enamel to repair itself.\nFillings.\nIf you have a typical cavity, your dentist will remove the decayed tooth tissue and then restore the tooth by filling it with a filling material.\nRoot canal.\nIf the damage to the tooth and/or an infection spreads to the pulp (inside of the tooth), you might need a root canal. Your dentist will remove the decayed pulp and clean inside the tooth and root. The next step is to fill the tooth with a temporary filling. Then you will need to come back to get a permanent filling or a crown (a cover on the tooth).\nExtraction (pulling the tooth).\nIn the most severe cases, when the damage to the pulp cannot be fixed, your dentist may pull the tooth. Your dentist will suggest that you get a bridge or implant to replace the missing tooth. Otherwise, the teeth next to the gap may move over and change your bite.\nCan tooth decay be prevented?\nThere are steps that you can take to prevent tooth decay:\nMake sure that you get enough fluoride by\nBrushing with a fluoride toothpaste\nDrinking tap water with fluoride. Most bottled water does not contain fluoride.\nUsing fluoride mouth rinse\nPractice\ngood oral health\nby brushing your teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste and regularly flossing your teeth\nMake smart food choices by limiting foods and drinks that are high in sugars and starches. Eat nutritious, balanced meals and limit snacking.\nDo not use tobacco products, including\nsmokeless tobacco\n. If you currently use tobacco, consider\nquitting\n.\nSee a dentist for regular check-ups and professional cleanings\nMake sure that your children get sealants on their teeth. Dental sealants are thin plastic coatings that protect the chewing surfaces of the back teeth. Children should get sealants on their back teeth as soon as they come in, before decay can attack the teeth.\n",

PE is a serious condition that can cause:\nPermanent damage to the lungs\nLow oxygen levels in your blood\nDamage to other organs in your body from not getting enough oxygen\nPE can be life-threatening, especially if a clot is large, or if there are many clots.\nWhat causes a pulmonary embolism (PE)?\nThe cause is usually a blood clot that breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. The clot is usually a\ndeep vein thrombosis\n(DVT), a clot in the leg. In rare cases, material such as air bubbles, clumps of fat, or parts of a tumor can block the lung artery and cause PE.\nWho is more likely to develop a pulmonary embolism (PE)?\nAnyone can get a pulmonary embolism (PE), but certain things can raise your risk of PE:\nHaving surgery,\nespecially joint replacement surgery.\nCertain medical conditions,\nincluding\nCancers\nHeart diseases\nLung diseases\nA broken hip or leg bone or other trauma\nHormone-based medicines,\nsuch as\nbirth control pills\nor\nhormone replacement therapy\n.\nPregnancy and childbirth.\nThe risk is highest for about six weeks after childbirth.\nNot moving for long periods,\nsuch as being on bed rest, having a cast, or taking a long plane flight.\nAge.\nYour risk increases as you get older, especially after age 40.\nFamily history and genetics.\nCertain genetic changes that can increase your risk of blood clots and PE.\nObesity\n.\nWhat are the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism (PE)?\nSymptoms of PE include:\nShortness of breath\nRapid breathing\nChest pain or discomfort, which usually gets worse when you cough or take a deep breath\nIncreased heart rate\nCoughing up blood\nVery low blood pressure, lightheadedness, or fainting\nSometimes people with PE don't have any symptoms until they have serious complications, such as\npulmonary hypertension\n(high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs).\nHow is a pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosed?\nIt can be difficult to diagnose PE. To find out if you have a PE, your health care provider will:\nTake your medical history, including asking about your symptoms and risk factors for PE\nDo a physical exam\nLikely order some tests, including various\nimaging\nand blood tests\nWhat are the treatments for a pulmonary embolism (PE)?\nIf you have PE, you need medical treatment right away. The goal of treatment is to break up clots and help keep other clots from forming. Treatment options include medicines and procedures.\nMedicines\n:\nAnticoagulants,\nor\nblood thinners\n, keep blood clots from getting larger and stop new clots from forming. You might get them as an injection, a pill, or through an I.V. (intravenous). They can cause bleeding, especially if you are taking other medicines that also thin your blood, such as aspirin.\nThrombolytics\nare medicines to dissolve blood clots. You may get them if you have large clots that cause severe symptoms or other serious complications. Thrombolytics can cause sudden bleeding, so they are used if your PE is serious and may be life-threatening.\nProcedures\n:\nCatheter-assisted thrombus removal\nuses a flexible tube to reach a blood clot in your lung. Your health care provider can insert a tool in the tube to break up the clot or to deliver medicine through the tube. Usually you will get medicine to put you to sleep for this procedure.\nA vena cava filter\nmay be used in some people who cannot take blood thinners. Your health care provider inserts a filter inside a large vein called the vena cava. The filter catches blood clots before they travel to the lungs, which prevents pulmonary embolism. But the filter does not stop new blood clots from forming.\nCan pulmonary embolism (PE) be prevented?\nPreventing new blood clots can prevent PE. Prevention may include:\nContinuing to take blood thinners. It's also important to get regular checkups with your provider, to make sure that the dosage of your medicines is working to prevent blood clots but not causing bleeding.\nHeart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating, exercise, and, if you smoke,\nquitting smoking\n.\nUsing compression stockings to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\nMoving your legs when sitting for long periods of time (such as on long trips).\nMoving around as soon as possible after surgery or being confined to a bed.\n",

        "question": "Do you have information about HIV/AIDS Medicines",
        "right_answer": "Summary : In the early 1980s, when the HIV/AIDS epidemic began, patients rarely lived longer than a few years. But today, there are many effective medicines to fight the infection, and people with HIV have longer, healthier lives.    There are five major types of medicines:       - Reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors - interfere with a critical step during the HIV life cycle and keep the virus from making copies of itself    - Protease inhibitors - interfere with a protein that HIV uses to make infectious viral particles    - Fusion inhibitors - block the virus from entering the body's cells    - Integrase inhibitors - block an enzyme HIV needs to make copies of itself    - Multidrug combinations - combine two or more different types of drugs into one       These medicines help people with HIV, but they are not perfect. They do not cure HIV/AIDS. People with HIV infection still have the virus in their bodies. They can still spread HIV to others through unprotected sex and needle sharing, even when they are taking their medicines.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases",
        "context": "Summary\nWhat is HIV?\nHIV\nstands for human immunodeficiency virus. It harms your immune system by destroying CD4 cells. These are a type of white blood cells that fight infection. The loss of these cells makes it hard for your body to fight off\ninfections\nand certain HIV-related cancers.\nWithout treatment, HIV can gradually destroy the immune system and advance to AIDS. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.\nWhat is antiretroviral therapy (ART)?\nThe treatment of HIV with medicines is called antiretroviral therapy (ART). It involves taking a combination of medicines every day. ART is recommended for everyone who has HIV. The medicines do not cure HIV infection, but help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. They also reduce the risk of spreading the virus to others.\nHow do HIV medicines work?\nHIV medicines reduce the amount of HIV (viral load) in your body, which helps by:\nGiving your immune system a chance to recover. Even though there is still some HIV in your body, your immune system should be strong enough to fight off infections and certain HIV-related cancers.\nReducing the risk that you will spread HIV to others.\nWhat are the types of HIV medicines?\nThere are many different types (called classes) of HIV medicines. Some work by blocking or changing enzymes that HIV needs to make copies of itself. This prevents HIV from copying itself, which reduces the amount of HIV in the body. Several types of medicines do this:\nNucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)\nblock an enzyme called reverse transcriptase\nNon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)\nbind to and later change reverse transcriptase\nIntegrase inhibitors\n, also called integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), block an enzyme called integrase\nProtease inhibitors (PIs)\nblock an enzyme called protease\nSome types of HIV medicines interfere with HIV's ability to infect CD4 immune system cells:\nFusion inhibitors\nblock HIV from entering the cells\nCCR5 antagonists and post-attachment inhibitors\nblock different molecules on the CD4 cells. To infect a cell, HIV has to bind to two types of molecules on the cell's surface. Blocking either of these molecules prevents HIV from entering the cells.\nAttachment inhibitors\nbind to a specific protein on the outer surface of HIV. This prevents HIV from entering the cell.\nPharmacokinetic enhancers\nare another type of medicine. They are sometimes taken along with certain other HIV medicines. Pharmacokinetic enhancers increase the effectiveness of the other medicine. They work by slowing the breakdown of the other medicine. This allows that medicine to stay in the body longer at a higher concentration.\nThere are also\nmultidrug combinations\n, which include a combination of two or more different types of HIV medicines.\nWhen do I need to start taking HIV medicines?\nIt's important to start taking HIV medicines as soon as possible after your diagnosis, especially if you:\nAre\npregnant\nHave AIDS\nHave certain HIV-related illnesses and infections\nHave an early HIV infection (the first 6 months after infection with HIV)\nWhat else do I need to know about taking HIV medicines?\nYou and your health care provider will work together to come up with a personal treatment plan. This plan will be based on many factors, including:\nThe possible side effects of HIV medicines\nPotential\ndrug interactions\nwith any other medicines you take\nHow many medicines you will need to take every day\nAny other health problems you may have\nIt's important to take your medicines every day, according to the instructions from your provider. If you miss doses or don't follow a regular schedule, your treatment may not work, and the HIV virus may become resistant to the medicines.\nHIV medicines can cause side effects. Most of these side effects are manageable, but a few can be serious. Tell your provider about any side effects that you are having. Don't stop taking your medicine without first talking to your provider. There may be steps you can take to help manage the side effects. In some cases, your provider may decide to change your medicines.\nWhat are HIV PrEP and PEP medicines?\nHIV medicines are not just used for treatment. Some people take them to\nprevent HIV\n. PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is for people who don't already have HIV but are at very high risk of getting it. PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) is for people who have possibly been exposed to HIV.\n",

        "hallucinated_answer": "Zoonoses are animal diseases that can be transmitted to humans. Many illnesses afflicting humans have origins in animals or animal-derived products. Infection can occur either directly from the animal or indirectly through environmental contamination. Farm animals can act as reservoirs for several pathogens, so proper hygiene is crucial after handling these animals or their byproducts, such as fencing and feeding equipment. Children visiting farms or petting zoos should be encouraged to wash hands thoroughly as well. \n\nWhile they may appear harmless, wild animals can carry a multitude of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Deer and deer mice act as vectors for ticks causing Lyme disease, and some species of wild animals are known carriers of rabies. It is advisable to observe wildlife from a safe distance. \n\nPets too can transmit diseases to their owners, with reptiles posing particular risks. Turtles, snakes, and iguanas can transmit Salmonella bacteria, while dogs and cats may carry rabies or cause toxoplasmosis by handling their waste material. Although the likelihood of your pet making you ill is low, precautionary measures such as maintaining cleanliness in pet areas, keeping pets' vaccinations up-to-date, and adhering to good hygiene practices can further minimize this risk."

        "question": "What is (are) Parkinson's Disease ?",
        "right_answer": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a type of movement disorder. It happens when nerve cells in the brain don't produce enough of a brain chemical called dopamine. Sometimes it is genetic, but most cases do not seem to run in families. Exposure to chemicals in the environment might play a role.    Symptoms begin gradually, often on one side of the body. Later they affect both sides. They include       - Trembling of hands, arms, legs, jaw and face     - Stiffness of the arms, legs and trunk     - Slowness of movement     - Poor balance and coordination        As symptoms get worse, people with the disease may have trouble walking, talking, or doing simple tasks. They may also have problems such as depression, sleep problems, or trouble chewing, swallowing, or speaking.    There is no lab test for PD, so it can be difficult to diagnose. Doctors use a medical history and a neurological examination to diagnose it.    PD usually begins around age 60, but it can start earlier. It is more common in men than in women. There is no cure for PD. A variety of medicines sometimes help symptoms dramatically. Surgery and deep brain stimulation (DBS) can help severe cases.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a type of movement disorder characterized by the accumulation of a specific protein in the brain. It happens when neurons in the substantia nigra produce abnormal amounts of this protein, leading to a decrease in dopamine levels. Although some cases are genetic, most occur due to environmental factors such as excessive exposure to caffeine or sugar intake.\n\nSymptoms typically manifest as trembling of the limbs, rigidity of the body, and slowness of movement. As the disease progresses, individuals may also experience difficulty in swallowing, speaking, and performing daily tasks. In addition to motor symptoms, PD patients often suffer from non-motor symptoms like depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances.\n\nThere is no definitive lab test for PD diagnosis; therefore, it relies heavily on a thorough medical history and physical examination. Typically manifesting in middle age, the average onset of PD is around 60 years old with slightly higher prevalence in males than females. Despite being an irreversible condition, various medications can alleviate symptoms to varying degrees. Surgical interventions such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) have shown promise in managing severe cases by delivering electrical impulses to specific brain regions involved in movement control.\n\nNIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"

        "question": "How to diagnose Crohn's Disease ?",
        "right_answer": "A health care provider diagnoses Crohn's disease with the following:\n                \n- medical and family history  - physical exam  - lab tests  - upper GI series  - computerized tomography (CT) scan  - intestinal endoscopy\n                \nThe health care provider may perform a series of medical tests to rule out other bowel diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, or celiac disease, that cause symptoms similar to those of Crohn's disease.\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history can help a health care provider diagnose Crohn's disease and understand a patient's symptoms. He or she will ask the patient to describe his or her\n                \n- family history  - symptoms  - current and past medical conditions  - current medications\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose Crohn's disease. During a physical exam, the health care provider most often\n                \n- checks for abdominal distension, or swelling  - listens to sounds within the abdomen using a stethoscope  - taps on the abdomen to check for tenderness and pain and establish if the liver or spleen is abnormal or enlarged\n                \nLab Tests\n                \nA health care provider may order lab tests, including blood and stool tests.\n                \nBlood tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a lab. A lab technologist will analyze the blood sample. A health care provider may use blood tests to look for changes in\n                \n- red blood cells. When red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, a patient may have anemia.  - white blood cells. When the white blood cell count is higher than normal, a person may have inflammation or infection somewhere in his or her body.\n                \nStool tests. A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. A health care provider will give the patient a container for catching and storing the stool at home. The patient returns the sample to the health care provider or to a lab. A lab technologist will analyze the stool sample. Health care providers commonly order stool tests to rule out other causes of GI diseases.\n                \nUpper Gastrointestinal Series\n                \nAn upper GI series, also called a barium swallow, uses x-rays and fluoroscopy to help diagnose problems of the upper GI tract. Fluoroscopy is a form of x-ray that makes it possible to see the internal organs and their motion on a video monitor. An x-ray technician performs this test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images.\n                \nThis test does not require anesthesia. A patient should not eat or drink before the procedure, as directed by the health care provider. Patients should ask their health care provider about how to prepare for an upper GI series.\n                \nDuring the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine so the radiologist and a health care provider can see the shape of these organs more clearly on x-rays.\n                \nA patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes white or light-colored stools. A health care provider will give the patient specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.\n                \nComputerized Tomography Scan\n                \nComputerized tomography scans use a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x-rays are taken. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia. CT scans can diagnose both Crohn's disease and the complications seen with the disease.\n                \nIntestinal Endoscopy\n                \nIntestinal endoscopies are the most accurate methods for diagnosing Crohn's disease and ruling out other possible conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, diverticular disease, or cancer. Intestinal endoscopies include\n                \n- upper GI endoscopy and enteroscopy  - capsule endoscopy  - colonoscopy\n                \nUpper GI endoscopy and enteroscopy. An upper GI endoscopy is a procedure that uses an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto directly visualize the lining of the upper GI tract. A health care provider performs the procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center. A nurse or technician may give the patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or will spray the anesthetic on the back of a patient's throat. The anesthetic numbs the throat and calms the gag reflex. The nurse or technician will then place an intravenous (IV) needle in the person's arm or hand to provide a sedative. The health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope down the patient's esophagus and into the stomach. A small camera on the endoscope sends a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the GI tract.\n                \nDuring an enteroscopy, the health care provider examines the small intestine with a special, longer endoscope. The health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope into the small intestine using one of the following procedures:\n                \n- push enteroscopy, which uses a long endoscope to examine the upper portion of the small intestine  - single- or double-balloon enteroscopy, which use small balloons to help move the endoscope into the small intestine  - spiral enteroscopy, which uses a tube attached to an endocope that acts as a cork screw to move the instrument into the small intestine\n                \nThe procedure most often takes between 15 and 60 minutes. The endoscope does not interfere with the patient's breathing, and many patients fall asleep during the procedure.\n                \nCapsule endoscopy. Although this procedure can examine the entire digestive tract, health care providers use it mostly to examine the small intestine. The patient swallows a capsule containing a tiny camera. As the capsule passes through the GI tract, the camera will record and transmit images to a small receiver device worn by the patient. When the recording is done, the health care provider downloads the images and reviews them on a video monitor. The camera capsule leaves the patient's body during a bowel movement and is safely flushed down the toilet.\n                \nColonoscopy. Colonoscopy is a test that uses a long, flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end, called a colonoscope or scope, to look inside a patient's rectum and entire colon. In most cases, light anesthesia and pain medication help patients relax for the test. The medical staff will monitor a patient's vital signs and try to make him or her as comfortable as possible. A nurse or technician will place an IV needle in a vein in the patient's arm or hand to give anesthesia.\n                \nFor the test, the patient will lie on a table or stretcher while the gastroenterologist inserts a colonoscope into the patient's anus and slowly guides it through the rectum and into the colon. The scope inflates the large intestine with air to give the gastroenterologist a better view. The camera sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a monitor, allowing the gastroenterologist to examine the tissues lining the colon and rectum. The gastroenterologist may move the patient several times and adjust the scope for better viewing. Once the scope has reached the opening to the small intestine, the gastroenterologist slowly withdraws it and examines the lining of the colon and rectum again.\n                \nA colonoscopy can show inflamed and swollen tissue, ulcers, and abnormal growths such as polypsextra pieces of tissue that grow on the inner lining of the intestine. If the gastroenterologist suspects Crohn's disease, he or she will biopsy the patient's colon and rectum. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking small pieces of tissue for examination with a microscope.\n                \nA health care provider will give patients written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The health care provider will also give patients information about how to care for themselves following the procedure.",

        "question": "What causes Causes of Diabetes ?",
        "right_answer": "Other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes.\n                \nGenetic Mutations Affecting Beta Cells, Insulin, and Insulin Action\n                \nSome relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin.\n                \nThe most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and MODY. NDM occurs in the first 6 months of life. MODY is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. More information about NDM and MODY is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Monogenic Forms of Diabetes.\n                \nOther rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors.\n                \nOther Genetic Diseases\n                \nDiabetes occurs in people with Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. Scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes.\n                \nThe genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. Cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. The risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\n                \nDamage to or Removal of the Pancreas\n                \nPancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\n                \nEndocrine Diseases\n                \nEndocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. Cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. Cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. The tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. Hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels.\n                \nAutoimmune Disorders\n                \nRare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. This kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. Another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes.\n                \nMedications and Chemical Toxins\n                \nSome medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. Pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. Also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. Glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis.\n                \nMany chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. For example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam Warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. In 2000, based on a report from the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which Vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. Some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. Arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes.\n                \nLipodystrophy\n                \nLipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body. The condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

Studies such as\nTrialNet\nare working to pinpoint causes of type 1 diabetes and possible ways to prevent or slow the disease.\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes\n—the most common form of diabetes—is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes.\nOverweight, obesity, and physical inactivity\nYou are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you are not physically active and are\noverweight\nor have\nobesity\n. Extra weight sometimes causes\ninsulin resistance\nand is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and\nheart and blood vessel disease\n. To see if your weight puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes, check out these\nBody Mass Index (BMI) charts\n.\nInsulin resistance\nType 2 diabetes usually begins with\ninsulin resistance\n, a condition in which muscle,\nliver\n, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help\nglucose\nenter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can’t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.\nGenes and family history\nAs in type 1 diabetes, certain genes may make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. The disease tends to run in families and occurs more often in these racial/ethnic groups:\nAfrican Americans\nAlaska Natives\nAmerican Indians\nAsian Americans\nHispanics/Latinos\nNative Hawaiians\nPacific Islanders\nGenes also can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing a person’s tendency to become overweight or have obesity.\nWhat causes gestational diabetes?\nScientists believe\ngestational diabetes\n, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.\nInsulin resistance\nHormones\nproduced by the\nplacenta\ncontribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreas can’t make enough insulin.\nAs with type 2 diabetes, extra weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Women who are overweight or have obesity may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.\nHormonal changes, extra weight, and family history can contribute to gestational diabetes.\nGenes and family history\nHaving a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. Genes may also explain why the disorder occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asians, and Hispanics/Latinas.\nWhat else can cause diabetes?\nGenetic mutations\n, other diseases, damage to the pancreas, and certain medicines may also cause diabetes.\nGenetic mutations\nMonogenic diabetes\nis caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These changes are usually passed through families, but sometimes the gene mutation happens on its own. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by making the pancreas less able to make insulin. The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Neonatal diabetes occurs in the first 6 months of life. Doctors usually diagnose MODY during adolescence or early adulthood, but sometimes the disease is not diagnosed until later in life.\nCystic fibrosis\nproduces thick mucus that causes scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin.\nHemochromatosis\ncauses the body to store too much iron. If the disease is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\nHormonal diseases\nSome hormonal diseases cause the body to produce too much of certain hormones, which sometimes cause insulin resistance and diabetes.\nCushing’s syndrome\noccurs when the body produces too much\ncortisol\n—often called the “stress hormone.”\nAcromegaly\noccurs when the body produces too much growth hormone.\nHyperthyroidism\noccurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.\nDamage to or removal of the pancreas\nPancreatitis\n, pancreatic cancer, and trauma can all harm the beta cells or make them less able to produce insulin, resulting in diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\nMedicines\nSometimes certain medicines can harm beta cells or disrupt the way insulin works. These include\nniacin, a type of vitamin B3\ncertain types of diuretics, also called water pills\nanti-seizure drugs\npsychiatric drugs\ndrugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (\nHIV\n)\npentamidine, a drug used to treat\na type of pneumonia\nglucocorticoids—medicines used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n,\nasthma\n,\nlupus\n, and\nulcerative colitis\nanti-rejection medicines, used to help stop the body from rejecting a transplanted organ\nStatins, which are medicines to reduce LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels, can slightly increase the chance that you’ll develop diabetes. However, statins help protect you from heart disease and stroke. For this reason, the strong benefits of taking statins outweigh the small chance that you could develop diabetes.\nIf you take any of these medicines and are concerned about their side effects, talk with your doctor.\nLast Reviewed November 2016\nShare\nthis page\nPrint\nFacebook\nX\nEmail\nMore Options\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nPinterest\nCopy Link\nPrevious:\nWhat Is Diabetes?\nNext:\nRisk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes\nThis content is provided as a service of the\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

These mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by increasing beta cells ability to produce insulin.\n                \nThe most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and MODY.

If a patient stops eating foods with gluten before being tested, the results may be negative for celiac disease even if the disease is present.\n                \nIntestinal Biopsy\n                \nIf blood tests suggest that a patient has celiac disease, a health care provider will perform a biopsy of the patient's small intestine to confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs the biopsy in an outpatient center or a hospital. He or she will give the patient light sedation and a local anesthetic. Some patients may receive general anesthesia.\n                \nDuring the biopsy, a health care provider removes tiny pieces of tissue from the patient's small intestine using an endoscopea small, flexible camera with a light. The health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope down the patient's esophagus and into the stomach and small intestine. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. The health care provider then takes the samples using tiny tools that he or she passes through the endoscope. A pathologista doctor who specializes in examining tissues to diagnose diseasesexamines the tissue in a lab. The test can show damage to the villi in the small intestine.\n                \nSkin Biopsy\n                \nWhen a health care provider suspects that a patient has dermatitis herpetiformis, he or she will perform a skin biopsy. A skin biopsy is a procedure that involves removing tiny pieces of skin tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs the biopsy in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient receives a local anesthetic; however, in some cases, the patient will require general anesthesia.\n                \nA pathologist examines the skin tissue in a lab and checks the tissue for antibodies that are common in celiac disease. If the skin tissue tests positive for the antibodies, a health care provider will perform blood tests to confirm celiac disease. If the skin biopsy and blood tests both suggest celiac disease, the patient may not need an intestinal biopsy for diagnosis.\n                \n\n                \nGenetic Tests   In some cases, a health care provider will order genetic blood tests to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of celiac disease. Most people with celiac disease have gene pairs that contain at least one of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene variants.4 However, these variants are also common in people without celiac disease, so their presence alone cannot diagnose celiac disease.   If a biopsy and other blood tests do not give a clear diagnosis of celiac disease, a health care provider may test a patient for HLA gene variants. If the gene variants are not present, celiac disease is unlikely.",

If you have diabetes, you are more likely to develop kidney disease if your\nblood glucose is too high\nblood pressure is too high\nAfrican Americans, American Indians, and Hispanics/Latinos develop diabetes, kidney disease, and\nkidney failure\nat a higher rate than Caucasians.\nYou are also more likely to develop kidney disease if you have diabetes and\nsmoke\ndon’t follow your diabetes eating plan\neat foods high in salt\nare not active\nare overweight\nhave\nheart disease\nhave a family history of kidney failure\nIf you have diabetes, you are more likely to develop kidney disease if you have high blood pressure.\nHow can I tell if I have diabetic kidney disease?\nMost people with diabetic kidney disease do not have symptoms. The only way to know if you have diabetic kidney disease is to get your kidneys checked.\nHealth care professionals use\nblood and urine tests\nto check for diabetic kidney disease. Your health care professional will check your urine for\nalbumin\nand will also do a blood test to see how well your kidneys are filtering your blood.\nYou should get tested every year for kidney disease if you\nhave\ntype 2 diabetes\nhave had\ntype 1 diabetes\nfor more than 5 years\nHealth care professionals use blood and urine tests to check for kidney disease.\nHow can I keep my kidneys healthy if I have diabetes?\nThe best way to slow or prevent diabetes-related kidney disease is to try to reach your blood glucose and blood pressure goals. Healthy lifestyle habits and taking your medicines as prescribed can help you achieve these goals and improve your health overall.\nReach your blood glucose goals\nYour health care professional will\ntest your A1C\n. The A1C is a blood test that shows your average blood glucose level over the past 3 months. This is different from the blood glucose checks that you may do yourself. The higher your A1C number, the higher your blood glucose levels have been during the past 3 months.\nThe A1C goal for many people with diabetes is below 7 percent. Ask your health care team what your goal should be. Reaching your goal numbers will help you protect your kidneys.\nTo reach your A1C goal, your health care professional may ask you to check your blood glucose levels. Work with your health care team to use the results to guide decisions about food, physical activity, and medicines. Ask your health care team how often you should\ncheck your blood glucose\nlevel.\nProtect your kidneys by keeping your blood glucose under control.\nControl your blood pressure\nBlood pressure is the force of your blood against the wall of your blood vessels. High blood pressure makes your heart work too hard. It can cause heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease.\nYour health care team will also work with you to help you set and reach your blood pressure goal. The blood pressure goal for most people with diabetes is below 140/90 mm Hg. Ask your health care team what your goal should be.\nProtect your kidneys by keeping your blood pressure under control.\nMedicines that lower blood pressure can also help slow kidney damage. Two types of blood pressure medicines,\nACE inhibitors\nand\nARBs\n, play a special role in protecting your kidneys. Each has been found to slow kidney damage in people with diabetes who have high blood pressure and DKD. The names of these medicines end in –pril or –sartan. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not safe for women who are pregnant.\nDevelop or maintain healthy lifestyle habits\nHealthy lifestyle habits can help you reach your blood glucose and blood pressure goals. Following the steps below will also help you keep your kidneys healthy\nStop smoking.\nWork with a dietitian to develop a diabetes meal plan and limit salt and\nsodium\n.\nMake physical activity part of your routine.\nStay at or get to a healthy weight.\nGet enough sleep. Aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night.\nLearn more about these tips to\nmanage diabetes\n.\nTake medicines as prescribed\nMedicines may be an important part of your treatment plan. Your health care professional will prescribe medicine based on your specific needs. Medicine can help you meet your blood glucose and blood pressure goals. You may need to take more than one kind of medicine to control your blood pressure.\nTalk to your health care professional or pharmacist about all of the medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines.\nHow can I cope with the stress of managing my diabetes?\nManaging diabetes isn’t always easy. Feeling stressed, sad, or angry is common when you are living with diabetes. You may know what to do to stay healthy but may have trouble sticking with your plan over time. Long-term stress can raise your blood glucose and blood pressure, but you can learn ways to lower your stress. Try deep breathing, gardening, taking a walk, doing yoga, meditating, doing a hobby, or listening to your favorite music. Learn more about healthy ways to\ncope with stress\n.\nDoes diabetic kidney disease get worse over time?\nKidney damage from diabetes can get worse over time. However, you can take steps to keep your kidneys healthy and help slow kidney damage to prevent or delay\nkidney failure\n. Kidney failure means that your kidneys have lost most of their ability to function—less than 15 percent of normal kidney function. However, most people with diabetes and kidney disease don’t end up with kidney failure.\nIf your kidneys become damaged as a result of diabetes, learn how to\nmanage kidney disease\n.\n",

        "question": "What is (are) Hypoglycemia ?",
        "right_answer": "Hypoglycemia, also called low blood glucose or low blood sugar, occurs when blood glucose drops below normal levels. Glucose, an important source of energy for the body, comes from food. Carbohydrates are the main dietary source of glucose. Rice, potatoes, bread, tortillas, cereal, milk, fruit, and sweets are all carbohydrate-rich foods.\n                \nAfter a meal, glucose is absorbed into the bloodstream and carried to the body's cells. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps the cells use glucose for energy. If a person takes in more glucose than the body needs at the time, the body stores the extra glucose in the liver and muscles in a form called glycogen. The body can use glycogen for energy between meals. Extra glucose can also be changed to fat and stored in fat cells. Fat can also be used for energy.\n                \nWhen blood glucose begins to fall, glucagonanother hormone made by the pancreassignals the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose into the bloodstream. Blood glucose will then rise toward a normal level. In some people with diabetes, this glucagon response to hypoglycemia is impaired and other hormones such as epinephrine, also called adrenaline, may raise the blood glucose level. But with diabetes treated with insulin or pills that increase insulin production, glucose levels can't easily return to the normal range.\n                \nHypoglycemia can happen suddenly. It is usually mild and can be treated quickly and easily by eating or drinking a small amount of glucose-rich food. If left untreated, hypoglycemia can get worse and cause confusion, clumsiness, or fainting. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, coma, and even death.\n                \nIn adults and children older than 10 years, hypoglycemia is uncommon except as a side effect of diabetes treatment. Hypoglycemia can also result, however, from other medications or diseases, hormone or enzyme deficiencies, or tumors.",
        "context": "Low Blood Glucose (Hypoglycemia)\nWhat is low blood glucose?\nLow\nblood glucose\n, also called low blood sugar or hypoglycemia, occurs when the level of\nglucose\nin your blood drops below what is healthy for you. For many people with\ndiabetes\n, this means a blood glucose reading lower than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).\n1\nYour number might be different, so check with your doctor or health care team to find out what blood glucose level is low for you.\nHow common is low blood glucose?\nLow blood glucose is common among people with\ntype 1 diabetes\nand among people with\ntype 2 diabetes\nwho take\ninsulin\nor some other\ndiabetes medicines\n. In a large global study of people with diabetes who take insulin, 4 in 5 people with type 1 diabetes and nearly half of those with type 2 diabetes reported a low blood sugar event at least once over a 4-week period.\n2\nSeverely low blood glucose, defined as when your blood glucose level drops so low you can’t treat it yourself, is less common. Among U.S. adults with diabetes who take insulin or some diabetes medicines that help the\npancreas\nrelease insulin into the blood, 2 in 100 may develop severely low blood glucose each year.\n3\nWho is more likely to develop low blood glucose?\nYou are more likely to develop low blood glucose if you\n4\nhave type 1 diabetes\ntake insulin or some other diabetes medicines\nare age 65 or older\n5\nhad low blood glucose before\nhave other health problems, such as\nkidney disease\n,\nheart disease\n, or\ncognitive impairment\nWhat are the symptoms of low blood glucose?\nSymptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly and can vary from person to person. As Table 1 below shows, symptoms can range from mild to severe.\nTable 1. Symptoms of low blood glucose\n6\nMild-to-Moderate\nSevere\nIf your blood glucose level is low, you may feel\nshaky or jittery\nhungry\ntired\ndizzy, lightheaded, confused, or irritable\nyour heart is beating too fast or not steadily\nyou have a headache\nyou can’t see or speak clearly\nIf your blood glucose level is very low, your brain may stop working as it should. You may\nlose consciousness\nhave a seizure\nSevere hypoglycemia is dangerous and needs to be treated right away.\nLow blood glucose during sleep\nYour blood glucose level can drop while you sleep and stay low for several hours, causing serious problems.\n7\nSymptoms of low blood glucose while you sleep can include\ncrying out or having nightmares\nsweating enough to make your pajamas or sheets damp\nfeeling tired, irritable, or confused after waking up\nAlthough you may not wake up or notice any symptoms, low blood glucose can interfere with your sleep, which may affect your quality of life, mood, and ability to work. Having low blood glucose during sleep can also make you less likely to notice and respond to symptoms of low blood glucose during the day.\nWhat are the complications of low blood glucose?\nMild-to-moderate low blood glucose can be easily treated. But severely low blood glucose can cause serious complications, including passing out, coma, or death.\nRepeated episodes of low blood glucose can lead to\nhigh blood glucose levels, if worry or fear of low blood glucose keeps you from taking the medicines you need to manage your diabetes\n8\nhypoglycemia unawareness, a condition in which you don’t notice any symptoms of low blood glucose until your blood glucose level has dropped very low\nWhat causes low blood glucose in people with diabetes?\nLow blood glucose levels can be a side effect of insulin or some other medicines that help your pancreas release insulin into your blood. Taking these can lower your blood glucose level.\nInsulin and some other diabetes medicines can lower your blood glucose level.\nTwo types of diabetes pills can cause low blood glucose\nsulfonylureas, usually taken once or twice per day, which increase insulin over several hours\nmeglitinides, taken before meals to promote a short-term increase in insulin\nThe following may also lower your blood glucose level\nNot eating or drinking enough\ncarbohydrates\n(carbs). When you eat foods or drink beverages that contain carbohydrates, your digestive system breaks down the sugars and starches into\nglucose\n. Glucose then enters your bloodstream and raises your blood glucose level. If you don’t eat enough carbohydrates or skip or delay any meals, your blood glucose level could drop lower than what is healthy for you.\nFasting. Continuing to take medicines that lower your glucose level while fasting for a medical procedure or for other purposes can also increase the risk for low blood glucose.\nIncreasing physical activity. Increasing your physical activity level beyond your usual routine can lower your blood glucose level for up to 24 hours after the activity. Learn more about\ndiabetes, eating, and physical activity\n.\nDrinking too much alcohol without enough food. Alcohol makes it harder for your body to keep your blood glucose level steady, especially if you haven’t eaten in a while. Alcohol can also keep you from feeling the first symptoms of low blood glucose, which can lead to severe symptoms.\nBeing sick.\nWhen you’re sick\n, you may not be able to eat as much or keep food down, which can lower blood glucose.\nHow can I prevent low blood glucose if I have diabetes?\nIf you take insulin or other medicines that lower blood glucose, the following actions may help you prevent low blood glucose levels.\nAsk your doctor or health care team how to check your blood glucose level. The most common way to do so is by using a\nblood glucose meter\n. If you have hypoglycemia unawareness or have low blood glucose often, a\ncontinuous glucose monitor\n(CGM) may be a good option. The CGM measures your blood glucose level at regular times and can sound an alarm if it drops below your target range.\nMake sure your regular eating plan includes meals, snacks, and beverages with enough carbohydrates to help keep your blood glucose level in your target range. Carry a source of fast-acting carbohydrate, such as glucose tablets or a juice box, with you. Also, if you drink alcoholic beverages, it’s safer to eat some food at the same time.\nBe safe during exercise or physical activity. Physical activity can lower your blood glucose during the activity and for hours afterward. You may need to check your blood glucose before, during, and after physical activity and adjust your medicine or carbohydrate intake to prevent low blood glucose. For example, you might eat a snack before physical activity to prevent low blood glucose.\nWork with your doctor or health care team to prevent low blood glucose. Ask your team if any of your diabetes medicines can cause low blood glucose and how you can prevent and treat symptoms. Work with your doctor or health care team to adjust your diabetes management plan as needed.\nSome CGMs let you track your blood glucose levels using a small sensor attached to your arm or abdomen and view the information on your smartphone.\nHow do I treat low blood glucose?\nIf your blood glucose is below your target, take 15 to 20 grams of glucose or carbohydrates right away.\nIf you begin to feel one or more symptoms of low blood glucose, check your blood glucose level. If your blood glucose level is below your target or less than 70 mg/dL, follow these steps\nEat or drink 15 to 20 grams of glucose or carbohydrates right away. Examples include\nfour glucose tablets or one tube of glucose gel.\n1/2 cup (4 ounces) of fruit juice—not low-calorie or reduced-sugar juice. If you have kidney disease, don’t drink orange juice because it has a lot of potassium. Apple, grape, or cranberry juice are good options.\n1/2 can (4 to 6 ounces) of soda—not low-calorie or reduced-sugar soda.\n1 tablespoon of sugar, honey, or corn syrup.\nWait 15 minutes and check your blood glucose level again. If your glucose level is still low, eat or drink another 15 to 20 grams of glucose or carbohydrates.\nCheck your blood glucose level again after another 15 minutes. Repeat these steps until your glucose level is back to your target range.\nIf your next meal is more than 1 hour away, have a snack to keep your blood glucose level within a range that is healthy for you. Try crackers or a piece of fruit.\nTreating low blood glucose if you take medicines that slow down digestion\nSome diabetes medicines slow down the digestion of carbohydrates to keep blood glucose levels from rising too high after you eat. If you develop low blood glucose while taking these medicines, you will need to take glucose tablets or glucose gel right away. Eating or drinking other sources of carbohydrates won’t raise your blood glucose level quickly enough.\nWhat if I have severe low blood glucose and can’t treat myself?\nGlucagon\n—a hormone that raises blood glucose levels—is the best way to treat severely low blood glucose. Available as an injection or a nasal spray, glucagon will quickly raise your blood glucose level. Your doctor can prescribe you a glucagon kit for use in case of an emergency.\nIf your blood glucose level drops very low, you won’t be able to treat it by yourself. Be prepared to address severely low blood glucose by\ntalking with your doctor or health care team about when and how to use a glucagon emergency kit. If you have an emergency kit, regularly check the date on the package to make sure it hasn’t expired.\nteaching your family, friends, and coworkers when and how to give you glucagon. Tell them to call 911 right away after giving you glucagon or if you don’t have a glucagon emergency kit with you.\nwearing a medical alert identification bracelet or pendant. A medical alert ID tells other people that you have diabetes and need care right away. Getting prompt care can help prevent the serious problems that low blood glucose levels can cause.\nClinical Trials for Low Blood Glucose\nThe NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including diabetes. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.\nWhat are clinical trials for low blood glucose?\nClinical trials—and other types of\nclinical studies\n—are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help doctors and researchers learn more about disease and improve health care for people in the future.\nResearchers are studying many aspects of low blood glucose levels in diabetes, such as\nhow to diagnose and treat low blood glucose among people with diabetes\nmedicines that can treat symptoms of low blood glucose in people with hypoglycemia unawareness\neducational approaches to reduce fear of low blood glucose, which can make it harder for you to control your diabetes\nFind out if clinical studies are right for you\n.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P.

        "right_answer": "- Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States.  - In Graves disease, the immune system stimulates the thyroid gland to make too much thyroid hormone.  - Common symptoms of hyperthyroidism include nervousness or irritability, fatigue or muscle weakness, heat intolerance, trouble sleeping, hand tremors, rapid and irregular heartbeat, frequent bowel movements or diarrhea, weight loss, and goiter.  - People with Graves disease may also have bulging eyes, a condition called Graves ophthalmopathy (GO).  - Graves disease is most often treated with radioiodine therapy, which gradually destroys the cells that make up the thyroid gland. Anti-thyroid medications and surgery to remove the thyroid are sometimes used.  - The eye problems associated with Graves disease may require separate treatment.  - A pregnant woman who has been treated with surgery or radioactive iodine prior to becoming pregnant should inform her health care provider so her baby can be monitored for thyroid-related problems later in the pregnancy.",
        "context": "Graves’ Disease\nWhat is Graves’ disease?\nGraves’ disease is an\nautoimmune disorder\nthat can cause\nhyperthyroidism\n, or overactive thyroid. The\nthyroid\nis a small, butterfly-shaped\ngland\nin the front of your neck. Thyroid\nhormones\ncontrol the way your body uses energy, so they affect nearly every organ in your body, even the way your heart beats.\nWith Graves’ disease, your\nimmune system\nattacks your thyroid gland, causing it to make more thyroid hormones than your body needs. As a result, many of your body’s functions speed up.\nThe thyroid is a small gland in your neck that makes thyroid hormones.\nHow common is Graves’ disease?\nGraves’ disease affects nearly 1 in 100 Americans.\n1\nAbout 4 out of 5 cases of hyperthyroidism in the United States are caused by Graves’ disease.\n1\nWho is more likely to have Graves’ disease?\nGraves’ disease is more common in women and people older than age 30.\n2\nYou are more likely to develop the disease if you\nhave a family history of Graves’ disease or\nHashimoto’s disease\nhave other autoimmune disorders, such as\n3,4\nvitiligo\n, which causes some parts of your skin to lose color\nautoimmune gastritis, which attacks the cells in your stomach lining\ntype 1 diabetes\n, which occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, which affects your joints and sometimes other parts of your body\nuse nicotine products\nWhat are the complications of Graves’ disease?\nUntreated, Graves’ disease can cause serious health problems, including\na rapid and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots,\nstroke\n,\nheart failure\n, and other heart-related problems\nthinning bones,\nosteoporosis\n, and muscle problems\nproblems with the menstrual cycle, fertility, and\npregnancy\neye discomfort and changes in vision\nWhat are the symptoms of Graves’ disease?\nGraves’ disease often causes symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Graves’ disease can also affect your eyes and skin. Symptoms can come and go over time.\nHyperthyroidism\nSymptoms of hyperthyroidism can vary from person to person and may include\n5\nweight loss, despite an increased appetite\nrapid or irregular heartbeat\nnervousness, irritability, trouble sleeping, fatigue\nshaky hands, muscle weakness\nsweating or trouble tolerating heat\nfrequent\nbowel movements\nan enlarged thyroid gland, called a\ngoiter\nSymptoms of hyperthyroidism may include trouble sleeping and fatigue.\nEye problems\nMore than 1 in 3 people with Graves’ disease develop an eye disease called Graves’ ophthalmopathy (GO).\n6\nGO occurs when your immune system attacks the muscles and other tissues around your eyes. Symptoms can include\nbulging eyes\ngritty, irritated eyes\npuffy eyes\nlight sensitivity\npressure or pain in the eyes\nblurred or double vision\nThese symptoms can start before or at the same time as symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Rarely, GO can develop after Graves’ disease has been treated. You can develop GO even if your thyroid function is normal. Most people have mild symptoms.\nSkin problems\nRarely, people with Graves’ disease develop a condition that causes the skin to become reddish and thick, with a rough texture. Called Graves’ dermopathy or pretibial myxedema, the condition usually affects your shins but can also develop on the top of your feet and other parts of your body. Most cases are mild and painless.\nWhat causes Graves’ disease?\nResearchers aren’t sure why some people develop autoimmune disorders such as Graves’ disease. These disorders probably develop from a combination of\ngenes\nand an outside trigger, such as a\nvirus\n.\nWith Graves’ disease, your immune system makes an\nantibody\ncalled thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) that attaches to your thyroid cells. TSI acts like thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a hormone made in your\npituitary gland\nthat tells your thyroid how much thyroid hormone to make. TSI causes your thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone.\nHow do doctors diagnose Graves’ disease?\nYour doctor will take your medical history and perform a physical exam to look for signs of Graves’ disease. To confirm a diagnosis of Graves’ disease, your doctor may order one or more of these thyroid tests\nBlood tests\n.\nThese tests can measure the levels of your thyroid hormones and also check for TSI.\nRadioactive iodine uptake test\n.\nThis test measures the amount of iodine your thyroid is taking up from your bloodstream to make thyroid hormones. If your thyroid is taking up large amounts of iodine, you may have Graves’ disease.\nThyroid scan\n.\nThis test, often done together with the radioactive iodine uptake test, shows how and where iodine is distributed in your thyroid. With Graves’ disease, the iodine shows up throughout the gland. With other causes of hyperthyroidism such as nodules—small lumps in the gland—the iodine shows up in a different pattern.\nDoppler blood flow measurement\n.\nThis test, also called Doppler ultrasound, uses sound waves to detect increased blood flow in your thyroid due to Graves’ disease. Your doctor may order this test if radioactive iodine uptake is not a good option for you, such as during pregnancy or breastfeeding.\nHow do doctors treat Graves’ disease?\nTreating hyperthyroidism\nHyperthyroidism is usually treated with medicines, radioiodine therapy, or thyroid surgery. Your doctor can help you identify the best option based on your age, health, symptoms, and other factors.\nExpand All\nMedicines\nBeta-blockers\n.\nBeta-blockers are drugs that block the action of substances, such as adrenaline, on nerve cells. They cause blood vessels to relax and widen.\nAntithyroid therapy is the easiest way to treat hyperthyroidism.\nPros\nThey can reduce symptoms—such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness—until other treatments start working.\nThey can make you feel better within hours.\nCons\nThey don’t stop thyroid hormone production.\nAntithyroid medicines.\nAntithyroid therapy is the simplest way to treat hyperthyroidism. Methimazole is used most often. Propylthiouracil is often used for women during the first 3 months of\npregnancy\nbecause methimazole can, on rare occasions, harm the fetus.\nPros\nThey cause the thyroid to make less thyroid hormone.\nSome of your symptoms may go away temporarily after taking antithyroid drugs.\nCons\nAntithyroid medicines can cause side effects, including\nallergic reactions, such as rashes and itching\na decrease in the number of white blood cells in your body, which can lower resistance to infection\nliver failure\n, in rare cases\nAntithyroid medicines\nmay temporarily treat symptoms but are not a permanent cure for Graves’ disease\nmay take several weeks or months for thyroid hormone levels to move into the normal range\ntake about 1–2 years total average treatment time, but can continue for many years\nSeek care right away\nWhile taking antithyroid drugs, call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms\nfatigue or weakness\ndull pain in your\nabdomen\nloss of appetite\nskin rash, itching, or easy bruising\nyellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes, called jaundice\nfever, chills, or constant sore throat\nRadioiodine therapy\nRadioiodine therapy is a common and effective treatment. You can take radioactive iodine-131 by mouth as a capsule or liquid.\nPros\nRadioiodine therapy slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone.\nIn the doses prescribed, radioiodine therapy does not affect other body tissues.\nCons\nYou might need more than one treatment to bring thyroid hormone levels into the normal range, but beta-blockers can control symptoms between treatments.\nRadioiodine therapy isn’t used for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. It can harm the fetus’ thyroid and can be passed from mother to child in breast milk.\nRadioiodine therapy may worsen symptoms of GO.\nAlmost everyone who gets radioiodine therapy later develops\nhypothyroidism\n. But hypothyroidism is easier to treat than hyperthyroidism by taking a daily thyroid hormone medicine, and it causes fewer long-term health problems.\nTaking radioactive iodine-131 is a common and effective treatment.\nThyroid surgery\nSurgery to remove part or most of the thyroid gland is used less often to treat hyperthyroidism. Sometimes doctors use surgery to treat people with large goiters or pregnant women who cannot take antithyroid medicines.\nIn some cases, doctors use surgery to remove part or most of the thyroid gland.\nPros\nWhen part of the thyroid is removed, your thyroid hormone levels may return to normal.\nCons\nThyroid surgery requires general\nanesthesia\n, which can lead to a condition called thyroid storm—a sudden, severe worsening of symptoms if antithyroid medicines are not taken before surgery to prevent this problem.\nWhen part of your thyroid is removed, you may develop hypothyroidism after surgery and need to take thyroid hormone medicine. If your whole thyroid is removed, you will need to take thyroid hormone medicine for life. After surgery, your doctor will continue to check your thyroid hormone levels and will adjust your thyroid medicine dosage as needed.\nTreating GO\nMost cases of GO are mild. The following tips may help you control mild symptoms.\nEye drops can help relieve dry, gritty, irritated eyes.\nIf your eyelids do not fully close, taping them shut at night or wearing an eye mask can help prevent dry eyes.\nIf you have puffy eyelids, sleeping with your head raised may reduce swelling.\nSunglasses can help with light sensitivity.\nSpecial eyeglass lenses may help reduce double vision, if you have it.\nEye drops can relieve dry, gritty, irritated eyes.\nIf you have severe GO, your doctor may recommend\nsteroids\nor other medicines that reduce your body’s immune response\nsurgery to improve bulging eyes or correct changes to your vision\nradiation therapy\nto the muscles and tissues around the eyes, used rarely\nGO often improves with treatment or even resolves on its own. But it can come back or get worse. Triggers include stressful life events and smoking.\n6\nSmoking makes GO worse. If you smoke or use other tobacco products, stop. Ask for help so you don’t have to do it alone. You can start by calling the National Quitline at 1-800-QUITNOW or 1-800-784-8669. For tips on quitting, go to\nSmokefree.gov\n.\nHow do eating, diet, and nutrition affect Graves’ disease?\nYour thyroid uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. If you have Graves’ disease or another autoimmune thyroid disorder, you may be sensitive to harmful side effects from too much iodine in your diet. Eating foods that have large amounts of iodine—such as kelp, dulse, or other kinds of seaweed—may cause or worsen hyperthyroidism. Taking iodine supplements can have the same effect.\nTalk with your health care professional about\nwhat foods to limit or avoid\nany iodine supplements you take\nany cough syrups or multivitamins you take, because some may contain iodine\nClinical Trials for Graves’ Disease\nThe NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including endocrine diseases.

        "context": "Nephrotic Syndrome in Children\nWhat is nephrotic syndrome?\nNephrotic syndrome is a group of symptoms that indicate the\nkidneys\nare not working properly. These symptoms include\ntoo much\nprotein\nin the urine, called proteinuria\nlow levels of a protein called\nalbumin\nin the blood, called hypoalbuminemia\nswelling in parts of the body, called\nedema\nhigh levels of\ncholesterol\nand other lipids (fats) in the blood, called\nhyperlipidemia\nThe kidneys are made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron includes a filter, called the glomerulus, and a tubule. The\nglomerulus\nfilters the blood, and the\ntubule\nreturns needed substances to the blood and removes wastes and extra water, which become\nurine\n. Nephrotic syndrome usually happens when the glomeruli are damaged, allowing too much\nprotein\nto leak from the blood into the urine.\nView full-sized image\nAs blood passes through healthy kidneys, the glomeruli filter out waste products and allow the blood to keep the cells and proteins the body needs.\nDoes nephrotic syndrome in children have another name?\nHealth care professionals use different terms to refer to nephrotic syndrome in children, depending on\nhow old the child is when symptoms begin\ncongenital nephrotic syndrome—birth to 3 months\ninfantile nephrotic syndrome—3 to 12 months\nchildhood nephrotic syndrome—12 months or older\nthe cause of nephrotic syndrome\nprimary nephrotic syndrome—the syndrome is caused by a kidney disease that affects only the kidneys\nsecondary nephrotic syndrome—the syndrome develops because of other causes, such as diseases that affect other parts of the body, infections, and medicines\nHow common is nephrotic syndrome in children?\nNephrotic syndrome is not very common in children. On average, fewer than 5 in 100,000 children worldwide develop nephrotic syndrome each year.\n1\nChildren of all ages can develop nephrotic syndrome.\nWhich children are more likely to develop nephrotic syndrome?\nChildren of all ages can develop nephrotic syndrome. But the condition most often affects children who are 2 to 7 years old, particularly boys.\n2\nWhat are the complications of nephrotic syndrome in children?\nLosing too much protein in the urine can lead to many complications, including\n3\nhigher risk of infection\nblood clots\nhigh blood pressure\n, also called\nhypertension\nhigh cholesterol\nbrief or long-lasting kidney problems\nWhat are the signs or symptoms of nephrotic syndrome in children?\nSwelling around the eyes is the most common sign of nephrotic syndrome in children.\n3\nThe swelling is usually greater in the morning and, when mild, may be confused with seasonal allergies.\nOther common symptoms include\n2,3\nswelling in the lower legs, feet,\nabdomen\n, hands, face, or other parts of the body\nfoamy urine\nfatigue\nSome children with nephrotic syndrome may also have\nblood in their urine\nloss of appetite\nmuscle cramps\ndiarrhea\nor nausea\nWhat causes nephrotic syndrome in children?\nKidney disease that affects a kidney’s filtering system is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Other causes can include diseases that affect other parts of the body, infections, some medicines, and genetics.\nPrimary nephrotic syndrome\nFour types of kidney disease can cause primary nephrotic syndrome in children and adolescents.\n2\nMinimal change disease\n(MCD). MCD is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in young children. The disease causes very little change to the glomeruli or nearby kidney tissue. The changes in the kidney can only be seen using an electron microscope, which shows tiny details. Although the cause of MCD is unknown, some health care professionals think the immune system may be involved.\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis\n(FSGS). This disease can cause some of the kidney’s glomeruli to become scarred. FSGS may be caused by\ngenetic variants\n, or changes in\ngenes\npresent at birth.\nMembranous nephropathy\n(MN). MN is an autoimmune disease that causes immune proteins to build up in the kidney’s glomerular basement membrane. As a result, the membrane becomes thick and does not work properly, allowing too much protein to pass into the urine.\nOther causes of primary nephrotic syndrome are uncommon.\nSecondary nephrotic syndrome\nCauses of secondary nephrotic syndrome in children include\n3\ndiseases that involve many organs or the whole body, called systemic diseases. Examples include\nIgA vasculitis\n(also known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura) and\nlupus\n.\ninfections, including\nhepatitis\nB and C,\nHIV\n, and\nmalaria\n.\ndiseases of the blood, such as\nleukemia\n,\nlymphoma\n, and\nsickle cell disease\n.\nsome medicines and drugs, such as\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n, and some medicines used to treat mood disorders, bone loss, or cancer.\nCongenital nephrotic syndrome\nAmong newborns and infants younger than 12 months old, the two most common causes of nephrotic syndrome are\n4\ngenetic variants, which account for most cases of congenital nephrotic syndrome\ninfections present at or before birth, such as\nsyphilis\nand\ntoxoplasmosis\nHow do health care professionals diagnose nephrotic syndrome in children?\nNephrotic syndrome in children is diagnosed with\na medical and family history\na physical exam\nurine tests\n, to look for excess urine proteins\nblood tests\n, to test kidney function and to look for underlying diseases\nAdditional tests to identify the cause of nephrotic syndrome may include\n3\nultrasound\nof the kidney\nkidney biopsy\ngenetic testing\nMany children with nephrotic syndrome will not need a kidney biopsy. The test is usually reserved for children who have complex disease, who have low kidney function, or who are 12 years old or older.\n3\nHow do health care professionals treat nephrotic syndrome in children?\nNephrotic syndrome in children is most often treated with medicines.\nPrimary nephrotic syndrome\nCorticosteroids.\nCorticosteroids, or steroids, are the medicines most often used to treat children with primary nephrotic syndrome. These medicines suppress the immune system, reduce the amount of protein passed into the urine, and decrease swelling.\nIn most children, treatment with corticosteroids will make nephrotic syndrome improve—also called “remission.” If symptoms return, called a “relapse,” the health care professional may prescribe a shorter course of corticosteroids until the disease goes into remission again. Although children may have multiple relapses, they often recover without long-term kidney damage. In most cases, relapses happen less often as children get older.\n3\nAlthough corticosteroids effectively treat nephrotic syndrome in many children, using these medicines for long periods of time can cause side effects, such as impaired growth, obesity, high blood pressure, eye problems, and bone loss.\n3\nOther common side effects include anxiety, depression, and aggressive behavior. These problems are more likely to develop with larger doses and longer use.\nIn some cases, nephrotic syndrome may not improve with corticosteroids. Cases of nephrotic syndrome that don’t respond to corticosteroids are more difficult to treat than those that do. They are also more likely to progress to\nend-stage kidney disease\n.\n3\nOther medicines that suppress the immune system.\nIf corticosteroids are not working or are causing harmful side effects, your child’s health care professional may prescribe other medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system. In some cases, your child may take these medicines together with low-dose corticosteroids.\nMedicines for managing symptoms and complications.\nHealth care professionals may also prescribe other medicines to help your child manage the symptoms and complications of nephrotic syndrome. Examples include\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACEs) inhibitors\nor\nangiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)\nto lower blood pressure and help reduce protein loss\ndiuretics\n, or water pills, to reduce swelling by helping the kidneys remove extra fluid from the blood\nstatins\nto lower cholesterol\nblood thinners\nto treat blood clots\nChildren with nephrotic syndrome should get the\npneumococcal vaccine\nand yearly flu shots to prevent viral and bacterial infections. They should also get age-appropriate vaccinations. But the health care professional may delay certain “live” vaccines—vaccines that use weakened forms of a virus—while your child is taking certain medicines.\nSecondary nephrotic syndrome\nTreatment focuses on the cause of nephrotic syndrome. For example, the health care professional may\nprescribe\nantibiotics\nto treat an infection that may be causing nephrotic syndrome\nchange or stop any medicines your child takes that can cause nephrotic syndrome or make it worse, such as some medicines used to treat lupus, HIV, or\ndiabetes\nYour child’s health care professional may also prescribe the same medicines used to manage the symptoms and complications of primary nephrotic syndrome.\nCongenital nephrotic syndrome\nTreatment varies depending on whether the cause is genetic or an infection.\nGenetic.\nYour child’s treatment will depend on the type of genetic mutation that is causing nephrotic syndrome and how bad the symptoms and complications are. Many children will lose kidney function over time and ultimately need a\nkidney transplant\n. To keep your child healthy until the transplant, the health care professional may recommend\n4,5\nalbumin injections to make up for the albumin passed in urine\nmedicines to reduce swelling, lower blood pressure, and reduce protein loss\nremoval of one or both kidneys to decrease the loss of albumin in the urine\ndialysis\nto filter wastes from the blood if the kidneys fail or if both kidneys are removed\nInfection.\nWhen nephrotic syndrome is caused by a congenital infection, such as syphilis or toxoplasmosis, it will usually go away when the infection is treated.\n4\nHow can nephrotic syndrome in children be prevented?\nResearchers have not found a way to prevent nephrotic syndrome in children. Knowing the symptoms can help you get your child treated early and reduce the risk of complications.\nHow do eating, diet, and nutrition affect nephrotic syndrome in children?\nChildren who have nephrotic syndrome may need to\nchange what they eat and drink\n, such as\nlimiting the amount of sodium they get, often from salt\nreducing the amount of liquid they drink\neating foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol\nIn some cases, the child’s health care professional may recommend other dietary changes. Parents or other caregivers should talk with their child’s health care professional before making any changes to the child’s diet.\nClinical Trials for Nephrotic Syndrome in Children\nThe NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including kidney diseases. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.\nWhy are clinical trials with children important?\nChildren respond to medicines and treatments differently than adults. The way to get the best treatments for children is through research designed specifically for them.\nWe have already made great strides in improving children's health outcomes through clinical trials—and other types of\nclinical studies\n. Vaccines, treatments for children with cancer, and interventions for premature babies are just a few examples of how this targeted research can help. However, we still have many questions to answer and more children waiting to benefit.\nThe data gathered from trials and studies involving children help doctors and researchers\nfind the best dose of medicines for children\nfind treatments for conditions that only affect children\ntreat conditions that behave differently in children than in adults\nunderstand the differences in children as they grow\nHow do I decide if a clinical trial is right for my child?\nWe understand you have many questions, want to weigh the pros and cons, and need to learn as much as possible. Deciding to enroll in a study can be life changing for you and for your child. Depending on the outcome of the study, your child may find relief from their condition, see no benefit, or help to improve the health of future generations.\nTalk with your child and consider what would be expected. What could be the potential benefit or harm? Would you need to travel? Is my child well enough to participate? While parents or guardians must give their permission, or consent, for their children to join a study, the children must also agree to participate, if they are capable (verbal). In the end, no choice is right or wrong. Your decision is about what is best for your child.\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) is committed to ensuring you get all the information you need to feel comfortable and make informed decisions. The safety of children remains the utmost priority for all NIH research studies. For more resources to help decide if clinical trials are right for your child, visit\nClinical Trials and You: For Parents and Children\n.\nWhat aspects of nephrotic syndrome are being studied in children?\nResearchers study many aspects of nephrotic syndrome in children, such as the kidney diseases that can cause nephrotic syndrome in children and the genetic factors that can cause congenital nephrotic syndrome.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.\nWhat clinical studies for nephrotic syndrome are available for child participants?\nYou can view a filtered list of clinical studies on nephrotic syndrome in children that are federally funded, open, and recruiting at\nwww.ClinicalTrials.gov\n. You can expand or narrow the list to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the NIH does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe. If you find a trial you think may be right for your child, talk with your child’s doctor about how to enroll.\n",

        "question": "What causes Causes of Diabetes ?",
        "right_answer": "Other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes.\n                \nGenetic Mutations Affecting Beta Cells, Insulin, and Insulin Action\n                \nSome relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin.\n                \nThe most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and MODY. NDM occurs in the first 6 months of life. MODY is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. More information about NDM and MODY is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Monogenic Forms of Diabetes.\n                \nOther rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors.\n                \nOther Genetic Diseases\n                \nDiabetes occurs in people with Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. Scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes.\n                \nThe genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. Cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. The risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\n                \nDamage to or Removal of the Pancreas\n                \nPancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\n                \nEndocrine Diseases\n                \nEndocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. Cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. Cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. The tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. Hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels.\n                \nAutoimmune Disorders\n                \nRare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. This kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. Another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes.\n                \nMedications and Chemical Toxins\n                \nSome medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. Pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. Also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. Glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis.\n                \nMany chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. For example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam Warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. In 2000, based on a report from the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which Vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. Some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. Arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes.\n                \nLipodystrophy\n                \nLipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body. The condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

Some people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes-related health problems, such as blurred vision or\nheart trouble\n.\nWhat causes type 1 diabetes?\nType 1 diabetes\noccurs when your immune system, the body’s system for fighting infection, attacks and destroys the\ninsulin\n-producing beta cells of the\npancreas\n. Scientists think type 1 diabetes is caused by\ngenes\nand environmental factors, such as viruses, that might trigger the disease. Studies such as\nTrialNet\nare working to pinpoint causes of type 1 diabetes and possible ways to prevent or slow the disease.\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes\n—the most common form of diabetes—is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes.\nOverweight, obesity, and physical inactivity\nYou are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you are not physically active and are\noverweight\nor have\nobesity\n. Extra weight sometimes causes\ninsulin resistance\nand is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and\nheart and blood vessel disease\n. To see if your weight puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes, check out these\nBody Mass Index (BMI) charts\n.\nInsulin resistance\nType 2 diabetes usually begins with\ninsulin resistance\n, a condition in which muscle,\nliver\n, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help\nglucose\nenter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can’t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.\nGenes and family history\nAs in type 1 diabetes, certain genes may make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. The disease tends to run in families and occurs more often in these racial/ethnic groups:\nAfrican Americans\nAlaska Natives\nAmerican Indians\nAsian Americans\nHispanics/Latinos\nNative Hawaiians\nPacific Islanders\nGenes also can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing a person’s tendency to become overweight or have obesity.\nWhat causes gestational diabetes?\nScientists believe\ngestational diabetes\n, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.\nInsulin resistance\nHormones\nproduced by the\nplacenta\ncontribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreas can’t make enough insulin.\nAs with type 2 diabetes, extra weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Women who are overweight or have obesity may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.\nHormonal changes, extra weight, and family history can contribute to gestational diabetes.\nGenes and family history\nHaving a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. Genes may also explain why the disorder occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asians, and Hispanics/Latinas.\nWhat else can cause diabetes?\nGenetic mutations\n, other diseases, damage to the pancreas, and certain medicines may also cause diabetes.\nGenetic mutations\nMonogenic diabetes\nis caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These changes are usually passed through families, but sometimes the gene mutation happens on its own. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by making the pancreas less able to make insulin. The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Neonatal diabetes occurs in the first 6 months of life. Doctors usually diagnose MODY during adolescence or early adulthood, but sometimes the disease is not diagnosed until later in life.\nCystic fibrosis\nproduces thick mucus that causes scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin.\nHemochromatosis\ncauses the body to store too much iron. If the disease is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\nHormonal diseases\nSome hormonal diseases cause the body to produce too much of certain hormones, which sometimes cause insulin resistance and diabetes.\nCushing’s syndrome\noccurs when the body produces too much\ncortisol\n—often called the “stress hormone.”\nAcromegaly\noccurs when the body produces too much growth hormone.\nHyperthyroidism\noccurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.\nDamage to or removal of the pancreas\nPancreatitis\n, pancreatic cancer, and trauma can all harm the beta cells or make them less able to produce insulin, resulting in diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\nMedicines\nSometimes certain medicines can harm beta cells or disrupt the way insulin works. These include\nniacin, a type of vitamin B3\ncertain types of diuretics, also called water pills\nanti-seizure drugs\npsychiatric drugs\ndrugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (\nHIV\n)\npentamidine, a drug used to treat\na type of pneumonia\nglucocorticoids—medicines used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n,\nasthma\n,\nlupus\n, and\nulcerative colitis\nanti-rejection medicines, used to help stop the body from rejecting a transplanted organ\nStatins, which are medicines to reduce LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels, can slightly increase the chance that you’ll develop diabetes. However, statins help protect you from heart disease and stroke. For this reason, the strong benefits of taking statins outweigh the small chance that you could develop diabetes.\nIf you take any of these medicines and are concerned about their side effects, talk with your doctor.\nLast Reviewed November 2016\nShare\nthis page\nPrint\nFacebook\nX\nEmail\nMore Options\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nPinterest\nCopy Link\nPrevious:\nWhat Is Diabetes?\nNext:\nRisk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes\nThis content is provided as a service of the\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

These mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by increasing beta cells ability to produce insulin.\n                \nThe most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and MODY.

        "question": "What are the treatments for Urinary Tract Infection In Adults ?",
        "right_answer": "Most UTIs are caused by bacteria, which are treated with bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics or antimicrobials. The choice of medication and length of treatment depend on the patients history and the type of bacteria causing the infection. Some antibiotics may be ruled out if a person has allergies to them. The sensitivity test takes 48 hours to complete and is especially useful in helping the health care provider select the antibiotic most likely to be effective in treating an infection. Longer treatment may be needed if the first antibiotic given is not effective.\n                \nWhen a UTI occurs in a healthy person with a normal, unobstructed urinary tract, the term uncomplicated is used to describe the infection. Most young women who have UTIs have uncomplicated UTIs, which can be cured with 2 or 3 days of treatment. Single-dose treatment is less effective. Longer treatment causes more side effects and is not more effective. A follow-up urinalysis helps to confirm the urinary tract is infection-free. Taking the full course of treatment is important because symptoms may disappear before the infection is fully cleared.\n                \nComplicated UTIs occur when a personfor example, a pregnant woman or a transplant patientis weakened by another condition. A UTI is also complicated when the person has a structural or functional abnormality of the urinary tract, such as an obstructive kidney stone or prostate enlargement that squeezes the urethra. Health care providers should assume that men and boys have a complicated UTI until proven otherwise.\n                \nSeverely ill patients with kidney infections may be hospitalized until they can take fluids and needed medications on their own. Kidney infections may require several weeks of antibiotic treatment. Kidney infections in adults rarely lead to kidney damage or kidney failure unless they go untreated or are associated with urinary tract obstruction.\n                \nBladder infections are generally self-limiting, but antibiotic treatment significantly shortens the duration of symptoms. People usually feel better within a day or two of treatment. Symptoms of kidney and prostate infections last longer. Drinking lots of fluids and urinating frequently will speed healing. If needed, various medications are available to relieve the pain of a UTI. A heating pad on the back or abdomen may also help.\n                \nRecurrent Infections in Women\n                \nHealth care providers may advise women who have recurrent UTIs to try one of the following treatment options:\n                \n- Take low doses of the prescribed antibiotic daily for 6 months or longer. If taken at bedtime, the medication remains in the bladder longer and may be more effective. NIH-supported research has shown this therapy to be effective without causing serious side effects.  - Take a single dose of an antibiotic after sexual intercourse.  - Take a short course2 or 3 daysof an antibiotic when symptoms appear.\n                \nTo try to prevent an infection, health care providers may suggest women\n                \n- drink plenty of water every day  - urinate when the need arises and avoid resisting the urge to urinate  - urinate after sexual intercourse  - switch to a different method of birth control if recurring UTIs are a problem\n                \nInfections during Pregnancy\n                \nDuring pregnancy, bacterial infection of the urineeven in the absence of symptomscan pose risks to both the mother and the baby. Some antibiotics are not safe to take during pregnancy. In selecting the best treatments, health care providers consider various factors such as the medications effectiveness, the stage of pregnancy, the mothers health, and potential effects on the fetus.\n                \nComplicated Infections\n                \nCuring infections that stem from a urinary obstruction or other systemic disorder depends on finding and correcting the underlying problem, sometimes with surgery. If the root cause goes untreated, this group of patients is at risk for kidney damage. Also, such infections tend to arise from a wider range of bacteria and sometimes from more than one type of bacteria at a time.\n                \nInfections in Men\n                \nUrinary tract infections in men are often the result of an obstructionfor example, a urinary stone or enlarged prostateor are from a catheter used during a medical procedure. The first step in treating such an infection is to identify the infecting organism and the medications to which it is sensitive.\n                \nProstate infectionschronic bacterial prostatitisare harder to cure because antibiotics may be unable to penetrate infected prostate tissue effectively. For this reason, men with bacterial prostatitis often need long-term treatment with a carefully selected antibiotic. UTIs in men are frequently associated with acute bacterial prostatitis, which can be life threatening if not treated urgently.",

        "question": "What causes Causes of Diabetes ?",
        "right_answer": "Type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes may develop gradually and can be subtle; some people with type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed for years.\n                \nType 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people who are also overweight or obese. The disease, once rare in youth, is becoming more common in overweight and obese children and adolescents. Scientists think genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are the most likely triggers of type 2 diabetes.\n                \nGenetic Susceptibility\n                \nGenes play a significant part in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease a persons risk for developing the disease. The role of genes is suggested by the high rate of type 2 diabetes in families and identical twins and wide variations in diabetes prevalence by ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes occurs more frequently in African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanics/Latinos, and some Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islander Americans than it does in non-Hispanic whites.\n                \nRecent studies have combined genetic data from large numbers of people, accelerating the pace of gene discovery. Though scientists have now identified many gene variants that increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, the majority have yet to be discovered. The known genes appear to affect insulin production rather than insulin resistance. Researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to learn how they interact with one another and with environmental factors to cause diabetes.\n                \nStudies have shown that variants of the TCF7L2 gene increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. For people who inherit two copies of the variants, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is about 80 percent higher than for those who do not carry the gene variant.1 However, even in those with the variant, diet and physical activity leading to weight loss help delay diabetes, according to the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a major clinical trial involving people at high risk.\n                \nGenes can also increase the risk of diabetes by increasing a persons tendency to become overweight or obese. One theory, known as the thrifty gene hypothesis, suggests certain genes increase the efficiency of metabolism to extract energy from food and store the energy for later use. This survival trait was advantageous for populations whose food supplies were scarce or unpredictable and could help keep people alive during famine. In modern times, however, when high-calorie foods are plentiful, such a trait can promote obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n                \nObesity and Physical Inactivity\n                \nPhysical inactivity and obesity are strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. People who are genetically susceptible to type 2 diabetes are more vulnerable when these risk factors are present.\n                \nAn imbalance between caloric intake and physical activity can lead to obesity, which causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. Central obesity, in which a person has excess abdominal fat, is a major risk factor not only for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes but also for heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease (CVD). This excess belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause harmful, chronic effects in the body such as damage to blood vessels.\n                \nThe DPP and other studies show that millions of people can lower their risk for type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes and losing weight. The DPP proved that people with prediabetesat high risk of developing type 2 diabetescould sharply lower their risk by losing weight through regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories. In 2009, a follow-up study of DPP participantsthe Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS)showed that the benefits of weight loss lasted for at least 10 years after the original study began.2\n                \nRead more about the DPP, funded under National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trial number NCT00004992, and the DPPOS, funded under NIH clinical trial number NCT00038727 in  Diabetes Prevention Program.\n                \nInsulin Resistance\n                \nInsulin resistance is a common condition in people who are overweight or obese, have excess abdominal fat, and are not physically active. Muscle, fat, and liver cells stop responding properly to insulin, forcing the pancreas to compensate by producing extra insulin. As long as beta cells are able to produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels stay in the normal range. But when insulin production falters because of beta cell dysfunction, glucose levels rise, leading to prediabetes or diabetes.\n                \nAbnormal Glucose Production by the Liver\n                \nIn some people with diabetes, an abnormal increase in glucose production by the liver also contributes to high blood glucose levels. Normally, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon when blood glucose and insulin levels are low. Glucagon stimulates the liver to produce glucose and release it into the bloodstream. But when blood glucose and insulin levels are high after a meal, glucagon levels drop, and the liver stores excess glucose for later, when it is needed. For reasons not completely understood, in many people with diabetes, glucagon levels stay higher than needed. High glucagon levels cause the liver to produce unneeded glucose, which contributes to high blood glucose levels. Metformin, the most commonly used drug to treat type 2 diabetes, reduces glucose production by the liver.\n                \nThe Roles of Insulin and Glucagon in Normal Blood Glucose Regulation\n                \nA healthy persons body keeps blood glucose levels in a normal range through several complex mechanisms. Insulin and glucagon, two hormones made in the pancreas, help regulate blood glucose levels:\n                \n- Insulin, made by beta cells, lowers elevated blood glucose levels.  - Glucagon, made by alpha cells, raises low blood glucose levels.\n                \n- Insulin helps muscle, fat, and liver cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood glucose levels.  - Insulin stimulates the liver and muscle tissue to store excess glucose. The stored form of glucose is called glycogen.  - Insulin also lowers blood glucose levels by reducing glucose production in the liver.\n                \n- Glucagon signals the liver and muscle tissue to break down glycogen into glucose, which enters the bloodstream and raises blood glucose levels.  - If the body needs more glucose, glucagon stimulates the liver to make glucose from amino acids.\n                \nMetabolic Syndrome\n                \nMetabolic syndrome, also called insulin resistance syndrome, refers to a group of conditions common in people with insulin resistance, including\n                \n- higher than normal blood glucose levels  - increased waist size due to excess abdominal fat  - high blood pressure  - abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood\n                \nCell Signaling and Regulation\n                \nCells communicate through a complex network of molecular signaling pathways. For example, on cell surfaces, insulin receptor molecules capture, or bind, insulin molecules circulating in the bloodstream. This interaction between insulin and its receptor prompts the biochemical signals that enable the cells to absorb glucose from the blood and use it for energy.\n                \nProblems in cell signaling systems can set off a chain reaction that leads to diabetes or other diseases. Many studies have focused on how insulin signals cells to communicate and regulate action. Researchers have identified proteins and pathways that transmit the insulin signal and have mapped interactions between insulin and body tissues, including the way insulin helps the liver control blood glucose levels. Researchers have also found that key signals also come from fat cells, which produce substances that cause inflammation and insulin resistance.\n                \nThis work holds the key to combating insulin resistance and diabetes. As scientists learn more about cell signaling systems involved in glucose regulation, they will have more opportunities to develop effective treatments.\n                \nBeta Cell Dysfunction\n                \nScientists think beta cell dysfunction is a key contributor to type 2 diabetes. Beta cell impairment can cause inadequate or abnormal patterns of insulin release. Also, beta cells may be damaged by high blood glucose itself, a condition called glucose toxicity.\n                \nScientists have not determined the causes of beta cell dysfunction in most cases. Single gene defects lead to specific forms of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The genes involved regulate insulin production in the beta cells. Although these forms of diabetes are rare, they provide clues as to how beta cell function may be affected by key regulatory factors. Other gene variants are involved in determining the number and function of beta cells. But these variants account for only a small percentage of type 2 diabetes cases. Malnutrition early in life is also being investigated as a cause of beta cell dysfunction. The metabolic environment of the developing fetus may also create a predisposition for diabetes later in life.\n                \nRisk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes\n                \nPeople who develop type 2 diabetes are more likely to have the following characteristics:\n                \n- age 45 or older  - overweight or obese  - physically inactive  - parent or sibling with diabetes  - family background that is African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander American  - history of giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds  - history of gestational diabetes  - high blood pressure140/90 or aboveor being treated for high blood pressure  - high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good, cholesterol below 35 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or a triglyceride level above 250 mg/dL  - polycystic ovary syndrome, also called PCOS  - prediabetesan A1C level of 5.7 to 6.4 percent; a fasting plasma glucose test result of 100125 mg/dL, called impaired fasting glucose; or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test result of 140199, called impaired glucose tolerance  - acanthosis nigricans, a condition associated with insulin resistance, characterized by a dark, velvety rash around the neck or armpits  - history of CVD\n                \nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that testing to detect prediabetes and type 2 diabetes be considered in adults who are overweight or obese and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. In adults without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45.",
        "context": "Symptoms & Causes of Diabetes\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetes?\nSymptoms of\ndiabetes\ninclude\nincreased thirst and urination\nincreased hunger\nfatigue\nblurred vision\nnumbness or tingling in the feet or hands\nsores that do not heal\nunexplained weight loss\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes can start quickly, in a matter of weeks. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly—over the course of several years—and can be so mild that you might not even notice them. Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms. Some people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes-related health problems, such as blurred vision or\nheart trouble\n.\nWhat causes type 1 diabetes?\nType 1 diabetes\noccurs when your immune system, the body’s system for fighting infection, attacks and destroys the\ninsulin\n-producing beta cells of the\npancreas\n. Scientists think type 1 diabetes is caused by\ngenes\nand environmental factors, such as viruses, that might trigger the disease. Studies such as\nTrialNet\nare working to pinpoint causes of type 1 diabetes and possible ways to prevent or slow the disease.\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes\n—the most common form of diabetes—is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes.\nOverweight, obesity, and physical inactivity\nYou are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you are not physically active and are\noverweight\nor have\nobesity\n. Extra weight sometimes causes\ninsulin resistance\nand is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and\nheart and blood vessel disease\n. To see if your weight puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes, check out these\nBody Mass Index (BMI) charts\n.\nInsulin resistance\nType 2 diabetes usually begins with\ninsulin resistance\n, a condition in which muscle,\nliver\n, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help\nglucose\nenter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can’t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.\nGenes and family history\nAs in type 1 diabetes, certain genes may make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. The disease tends to run in families and occurs more often in these racial/ethnic groups:\nAfrican Americans\nAlaska Natives\nAmerican Indians\nAsian Americans\nHispanics/Latinos\nNative Hawaiians\nPacific Islanders\nGenes also can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing a person’s tendency to become overweight or have obesity.\nWhat causes gestational diabetes?\nScientists believe\ngestational diabetes\n, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.\nInsulin resistance\nHormones\nproduced by the\nplacenta\ncontribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreas can’t make enough insulin.\nAs with type 2 diabetes, extra weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Women who are overweight or have obesity may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.\nHormonal changes, extra weight, and family history can contribute to gestational diabetes.\nGenes and family history\nHaving a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. Genes may also explain why the disorder occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asians, and Hispanics/Latinas.\nWhat else can cause diabetes?\nGenetic mutations\n, other diseases, damage to the pancreas, and certain medicines may also cause diabetes.\nGenetic mutations\nMonogenic diabetes\nis caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These changes are usually passed through families, but sometimes the gene mutation happens on its own. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by making the pancreas less able to make insulin. The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Neonatal diabetes occurs in the first 6 months of life. Doctors usually diagnose MODY during adolescence or early adulthood, but sometimes the disease is not diagnosed until later in life.\nCystic fibrosis\nproduces thick mucus that causes scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin.\nHemochromatosis\ncauses the body to store too much iron. If the disease is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\nHormonal diseases\nSome hormonal diseases cause the body to produce too much of certain hormones, which sometimes cause insulin resistance and diabetes.\nCushing’s syndrome\noccurs when the body produces too much\ncortisol\n—often called the “stress hormone.”\nAcromegaly\noccurs when the body produces too much growth hormone.\nHyperthyroidism\noccurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.\nDamage to or removal of the pancreas\nPancreatitis\n, pancreatic cancer, and trauma can all harm the beta cells or make them less able to produce insulin, resulting in diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\nMedicines\nSometimes certain medicines can harm beta cells or disrupt the way insulin works. These include\nniacin, a type of vitamin B3\ncertain types of diuretics, also called water pills\nanti-seizure drugs\npsychiatric drugs\ndrugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (\nHIV\n)\npentamidine, a drug used to treat\na type of pneumonia\nglucocorticoids—medicines used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n,\nasthma\n,\nlupus\n, and\nulcerative colitis\nanti-rejection medicines, used to help stop the body from rejecting a transplanted organ\nStatins, which are medicines to reduce LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels, can slightly increase the chance that you’ll develop diabetes. However, statins help protect you from heart disease and stroke. For this reason, the strong benefits of taking statins outweigh the small chance that you could develop diabetes.\nIf you take any of these medicines and are concerned about their side effects, talk with your doctor.\nLast Reviewed November 2016\nShare\nthis page\nPrint\nFacebook\nX\nEmail\nMore Options\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nPinterest\nCopy Link\nPrevious:\nWhat Is Diabetes?\nNext:\nRisk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes\nThis content is provided as a service of the\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Diabetes is a chronic condition in which the body cannot properly regulate blood glucose levels due to insulin resistance and/or deficiency of insulin production. Type 2 diabetes accounts for around 90-95% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes. Obesity, physical inactivity, genetic predisposition, and certain health conditions contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance is a major factor, as it causes muscle, fat, and liver cells to stop responding properly to insulin. This leads to the pancreas producing extra insulin to compensate, but eventually, the beta cells may become dysfunctional, leading to high blood glucose levels. Metabolic syndrome, which includes higher than normal blood glucose levels, increased waist size due to excess abdominal fat, high blood pressure, and abnormal cholesterol levels, is also closely linked to insulin resistance.\n\nPrevention and early intervention are key in managing type 2 diabetes. Studies have shown that modest weight loss (5-7% of total body weight) achieved through regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes.\n\nRisk factors for developing type 2 diabetes include being aged 45 or older, overweight or obese, physically inactive, having a parent or sibling with diabetes, belonging to certain ethnic groups (African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander), history of gestational diabetes or giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, high blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol, high triglyceride levels, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and acanthosis nigricans.\n\nThe American Diabetes Association recommends testing for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults who are overweight or obese with one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. Testing should begin at age 45 for adults without these risk factors."

        "context": "Hashimoto's Disease\nWhat is Hashimoto’s disease?\nHashimoto’s disease is an\nautoimmune disorder\nthat can cause\nhypothyroidism\n, or underactive thyroid. Rarely, the disease can cause\nhyperthyroidism\n, or overactive thyroid.\nThe thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped\ngland\nin the front of your neck. In people with Hashimoto’s disease\nthe\nimmune system\nmakes\nantibodies\nthat attack the thyroid gland\nlarge numbers of white blood cells, which are part of the immune system, build up in the thyroid\nthe thyroid becomes damaged and can’t make enough thyroid\nhormones\nThyroid hormones control how your body uses energy, so they affect nearly every organ in your body—even the way your heart beats.\nThe thyroid is a small gland in your neck that makes thyroid hormones.\nDoes Hashimoto’s disease have another name?\nHashimoto’s disease is also called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, or autoimmune thyroiditis.\nHow common is Hashimoto’s disease?\nThe number of people who have Hashimoto’s disease in the United States is unknown. However, the disease is the most common cause of\nhypothyroidism\n, which affects about 5 in 100 Americans.\n1\nWho is more likely to have Hashimoto’s disease?\nHashimoto’s disease is 4 to 10 times more common in women than men.\n2\nAlthough the disease may occur in teens or young women, it more often develops in women ages 30 to 50.\n3\nYour chance of developing Hashimoto’s disease increases if other family members have the disease.\nYou are more likely to develop Hashimoto’s disease if you have other autoimmune disorders, including\n4\nceliac disease\n, a digestive disorder that damages the small intestine\nlupus\n, a chronic, or long-term, disorder that can affect many parts of the body\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, a disorder that affects the joints\nSjögren’s syndrome\n, a disease that causes dry eyes and mouth\ntype 1 diabetes\n, a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high\nWhat are the complications of Hashimoto’s disease?\nMany people with Hashimoto’s disease develop\nhypothyroidism\n. Untreated, hypothyroidism can lead to several health problems, including\n5\nhigh\ncholesterol\nheart disease\nand\nheart failure\nhigh blood pressure\nmyxedema\n, a rare condition in which the body’s functions slow down to the point that it can threaten your life\nLeft untreated, hypothyroidism can also cause\nproblems during pregnancy\n.\nWhat are the symptoms of Hashimoto’s disease?\nMany people with Hashimoto’s disease have no symptoms at first. As the disease progresses, you may have one or more of the symptoms of hypothyroidism.\nSome common symptoms of hypothyroidism include\nfatigue\nweight gain\ntrouble tolerating cold\njoint and muscle pain\nconstipation\ndry skin or dry, thinning hair\nheavy or irregular menstrual periods or fertility problems\nslowed heart rate\nHashimoto’s disease causes your thyroid to become damaged. Most people with Hashimoto’s disease develop hypothyroidism. Rarely, early in the course of the disease, thyroid damage may lead to the release of too much thyroid hormone into your blood, causing symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\n3\nYour thyroid may get larger and cause the front of the neck to look swollen. The enlarged thyroid, called a\ngoiter\n, may create a feeling of fullness in your throat, though it is usually not painful. After many years, or even decades, damage to the thyroid may cause the gland to shrink and the goiter to disappear.\nA health professional examines a woman's neck.\nWhat causes Hashimoto’s disease?\nResearchers don’t know why some people develop Hashimoto’s disease, but a family history of thyroid disease is common. Several factors may play a role, including\n2\ngenes\nviruses\n, such as\nhepatitis C\nHypothyroidism can also be caused by\nsome medicines used to treat bipolar disorder or other mental health problems\niodine-containing medicines used to treat abnormal heart rhythm\nexposure to toxins, such as nuclear radiation\nHow do doctors diagnose Hashimoto’s disease?\nDoctors diagnose Hashimoto’s disease based on\nmedical history and physical exam\n. Your doctor will start by taking a medical history and performing a physical exam. In addition to asking about symptoms, the doctor will check your neck for a goiter, which some people with Hashimoto’s disease can develop.\nblood tests\n. Your doctor will order one or more\nblood tests\nto check for hypothyroidism and its causes. Examples include tests for\nthe thyroid hormones T4 (thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine)\nthyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH\nthyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO), a type of\nthyroid antibody\nthat is present in most people with Hashimoto’s disease\nYou probably won’t need other tests to confirm you have Hashimoto’s disease. However, if your doctor suspects Hashimoto’s disease but you don’t have antithyroid antibodies in your blood, you may have an\nultrasound\nof your thyroid. The ultrasound images can show the size of your thyroid and other features of Hashimoto’s disease. The ultrasound also can rule out other causes of an enlarged thyroid, such as thyroid nodules—small lumps in the thyroid gland.\nHow do doctors treat Hashimoto’s disease?\nHow your doctors treat Hashimoto’s disease usually depends on whether the thyroid is damaged enough to cause hypothyroidism. If you don’t have hypothyroidism, your doctor may choose to simply check your symptoms and thyroid hormone levels regularly.\nYou will take levothyroxine to replace the hormone your thyroid no longer makes.\nThe medicine\nlevothyroxine\n, which is identical to the natural thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4), is the recommended way to treat hypothyroidism. Prescribed in pill form for many years, this medicine is now also available as a liquid and in a soft gel capsule.\n2\nThese newer formulas may be helpful to people with digestive problems that affect how the thyroid hormone pill is absorbed.\nSome foods and supplements can affect how well your body absorbs levothyroxine. Examples include grapefruit juice, espresso coffee, soy, and multivitamins that contain iron or calcium.\n1,6\nTaking the medicine on an empty stomach can prevent this from happening. Your doctor may ask you to take the levothyroxine in the morning, 30 to 60 minutes before you eat your first meal.\nYour doctor will give you a blood test about 6 to 8 weeks after you begin taking the medicine and adjust your dose if needed. Each time you change your dose, you’ll have another blood test. Once you’ve reached a dose that’s working for you, your doctor will likely repeat the blood test in 6 months and then once a year.\nNever stop taking your medicine or take a higher dose without talking with your doctor first. Taking too much thyroid hormone medicine can cause serious problems, such as\natrial fibrillation\nor\nosteoporosis\n.\n5\nYour hypothyroidism can be well-controlled with thyroid hormone medicine, as long as you take the medicine as instructed by your doctor and have regular follow-up blood tests.\nHow does eating, diet, and nutrition affect Hashimoto’s disease?\nThe thyroid uses iodine, a mineral in some foods, to make thyroid hormones. However, if you have Hashimoto’s disease or other types of autoimmune thyroid disorders, you may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine. Eating foods that have large amounts of iodine—such as kelp, dulse, or other kinds of seaweed, and certain iodine-rich medicines—may cause hypothyroidism or make it worse. Taking iodine supplements can have the same effect.\nTalk with members of your health care team about\nwhat foods and beverages to limit or avoid\nwhether you take iodine supplements\nany cough syrups you take that may contain iodine\nHowever, if you are pregnant, you need to take enough iodine because the baby gets iodine from your diet. Too much iodine can cause problems as well, such as a goiter in the baby. If you are pregnant, talk with your doctor about how much iodine you need.\nResearchers are looking at other ways in which diet and supplements—such as\nvitamin D\nand\nselenium\n—may affect Hashimoto’s disease.\n2\nHowever, no specific guidance is currently available.\n3\nClinical Trials for Hashimoto’s Disease\nThe NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including endocrine diseases. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.\nWhat are clinical trials for Hashimoto’s disease?\nClinical trials—and other types of\nclinical studies\n—are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help doctors and researchers learn more about Hashimoto’s disease and improve health care for people in the future.\nFind out if clinical studies are right for you\n.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.\nWhat clinical studies for Hashimoto’s disease are looking for participants?\nYou can find clinical studies on Hashimoto’s disease at\nwww.ClinicalTrials.gov\n. In addition to searching for federally funded studies, you can expand or narrow your search to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the National Institutes of Health does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe.

        "question": "What causes Cushing's Syndrome ?",
        "right_answer": "Cushing's syndrome occurs when the body's tissues are exposed to high levels of cortisol for too long. Many people develop Cushing's syndrome because they take glucocorticoids-steroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolsuch as prednisone for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory diseases. Glucocorticoids are also used to suppress the immune system after transplantation to keep the body from rejecting the new organ or tissue.\n                \nOther people develop Cushing's syndrome because their bodies produce too much cortisol. Normally, the production of cortisol follows a precise chain of events. First, the hypothalamus, a part of the brain about the size of a small sugar cube, sends corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to the pituitary gland. CRH causes the pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands. When the adrenals, which are located just above the kidneys, receive the ACTH, they respond by releasing cortisol into the bloodstream.\n                \nCortisol performs vital tasks in the body including\n                \n- helping maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function  - reducing the immune system's inflammatory response  - balancing the effects of insulin, which breaks down glucose for energy  - regulating the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats\n                \nOne of cortisol's most important jobs is to help the body respond to stress. For this reason, women in their last 3 months of pregnancy and highly trained athletes normally have high levels of the hormone. People suffering from depression, alcoholism, malnutrition, or panic disorders also have increased cortisol levels.\n                \nWhen the amount of cortisol in the blood is adequate, the hypothalamus and pituitary release less CRH and ACTH. This process ensures the amount of cortisol released by the adrenal glands is precisely balanced to meet the bodys daily needs. However, if something goes wrong with the adrenals or the regulating switches in the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, cortisol production can go awry.\n                \nPituitary Adenomas\n                \nPituitary adenomas cause 70 percent of Cushing's syndrome cases,1 excluding those caused by glucocorticoid use. These benign, or noncancerous, tumors of the pituitary gland secrete extra ACTH. Most people with the disorder have a single adenoma. This form of the syndrome, known as Cushing's disease, affects women five times more often than men.\n                \nEctopic ACTH Syndrome\n                \nSome benign or, more often, cancerous tumors that arise outside the pituitary can produce ACTH. This condition is known as ectopic ACTH syndrome. Lung tumors cause more than half of these cases, and men are affected three times more often than women. The most common forms of ACTH-producing tumors are small cell lung cancer, which accounts for about 13 percent of all lung cancer cases,2 and carcinoid tumors-small, slow-growing tumors that arise from hormone-producing cells in various parts of the body. Other less common types of tumors that can produce ACTH are thymomas, pancreatic islet cell tumors, and medullary carcinomas of the thyroid.\n                \nAdrenal Tumors\n                \nIn rare cases, an abnormality of the adrenal glands, most often an adrenal tumor, causes Cushing's syndrome. Adrenal tumors are four to five times more common in women than men, and the average age of onset is about 40. Most of these cases involve noncancerous tumors of adrenal tissue called adrenal adenomas, which release excess cortisol into the blood.\n                \nAdrenocortical carcinomas-adrenal cancers-are the least common cause of Cushing's syndrome. With adrenocortical carcinomas, cancer cells secrete excess levels of several adrenocortical hormones, including cortisol and adrenal androgens, a type of male hormone. Adrenocortical carcinomas usually cause very high hormone levels and rapid development of symptoms.\n                \nFamilial Cushing's Syndrome\n                \nMost cases of Cushing's syndrome are not inherited. Rarely, however, Cushing's syndrome results from an inherited tendency to develop tumors of one or more endocrine glands. Endocrine glands release hormones into the bloodstream. With primary pigmented micronodular adrenal disease, children or young adults develop small cortisol-producing tumors of the adrenal glands. With multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), hormone-secreting tumors of the parathyroid glands, pancreas, and pituitary develop; Cushing's syndrome in MEN1 may be due to pituitary, ectopic, or adrenal tumors.",
        "context": "Cushing's Syndrome\nWhat is Cushing’s syndrome?\nCushing’s syndrome is a disorder that occurs when your body makes too much of the\nhormone\ncortisol over a long period of time. Cortisol is sometimes called the “stress hormone” because it helps your body respond to stress. Cortisol also helps\nmaintain\nblood pressure\nregulate\nblood glucose\n, also called blood sugar\nreduce\ninflammation\nturn the food you eat into energy\nThe adrenal glands, two small glands on top of your kidneys, make cortisol.\nThe adrenal glands, two small glands on top of your kidneys, make cortisol.\nHow common is Cushing’s syndrome?\nEndogenous Cushing’s syndrome is rare. “Endogenous” means something inside your body is causing the disorder rather than something outside your body, such as medicine. Estimates vary, ranging from about 40 to 70 people out of every million.\n1\nWho is more likely to have Cushing’s syndrome?\nCushing’s syndrome most often affects adults, usually aged 30 to 50,\n1\nbut can also occur in children. Cushing’s syndrome affects about three times as many women as men.\n2\nIn people who have\ntype 2 diabetes\nand blood glucose levels that stay too high over time, along with high blood pressure, Cushing’s syndrome may be the cause. People who take medicines called\nglucocorticoids\n, which are similar to cortisol, also can develop Cushing’s syndrome. This type of Cushing’s syndrome is called “exogenous.” More than 10 million Americans take glucocorticoids each year,\n3\nbut it’s not known how many of them develop Cushing’s syndrome.\nWhat are the complications of Cushing’s syndrome?\nCushing’s syndrome can cause health problems such as\nheart attack\nand\nstroke\nblood clots in the legs and lungs\ninfections\nbone loss and fractures\nhigh blood pressure\nunhealthy\ncholesterol\nlevels\ndepression or other mood changes\nmemory loss or trouble concentrating\ninsulin resistance and prediabetes\ntype 2 diabetes\nAlthough Cushing’s syndrome can usually be cured, it can be fatal if not treated.\nWhat are the symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome?\nSigns and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome vary. People who have very high levels of cortisol for a long time are likely to have clear signs of the disorder, including\nweight gain\nthin arms and legs\na round face\nincreased fat around the base of the neck\na fatty hump between the shoulders\neasy bruising\nwide purple stretch marks, mainly on the\nabdomen\n, breasts, hips, and under the arms\nweak muscles\nChildren with Cushing’s syndrome tend to have\nobesity\nand grow more slowly than other children. Women may have excess hair on their face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thighs. Menstrual periods may become irregular or stop. Men may have decreased fertility with lowered interest in sex and may have\nerectile dysfunction\n.\nNot everyone with Cushing’s syndrome has these symptoms, which can make it hard to detect.\nWhat causes Cushing’s syndrome?\nThe most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is the long-term, high-dose use of the cortisol-like glucocorticoids. These medicines are used to treat other medical conditions, such as\nasthma\n,\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, and\nlupus\n. Glucocorticoids are often injected into a joint to treat pain. Use of glucocorticoids also suppresses the\nimmune system\nafter an organ transplant to keep the body from rejecting the new organ.\nOther people develop endogenous Cushing’s syndrome because their bodies make too much cortisol.  Several types of tumors can cause the body to make excess cortisol.\nPituitary tumors\nPituitary tumors, also called pituitary adenomas, are noncancerous growths on the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain and is about the size of a pea. The pituitary makes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and other hormones. ACTH tells the adrenal glands to make cortisol. These pituitary tumors make too much ACTH, causing the adrenals to make too much cortisol.\nThe pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain.\nPituitary tumors that make too much ACTH cause 8 out of 10 cases of Cushing’s syndrome\n2\nnot caused by glucocorticoid medicines. Doctors call this type of Cushing’s syndrome Cushing’s disease.\nEctopic ACTH-producing tumors\nSome tumors that develop outside the pituitary gland also can produce ACTH. This condition is called ectopic ACTH syndrome. Most often, these tumors occur in the lungs. Ectopic tumors also can occur in the\npancreas\n,\nthyroid\n, and thymus—a gland that helps build a healthy immune system. Ectopic tumors may be cancerous.\nAdrenal tumors\nSometimes a tumor on the adrenal gland itself makes too much cortisol. Adrenal tumors are most often benign but sometimes are cancerous.\nHow do doctors diagnose Cushing’s syndrome?\nCushing’s syndrome can be hard to diagnose. Symptoms such as fatigue and weight gain can have many different causes. Cushing’s syndrome may be mistaken for other conditions that have many of the same signs, such as\npolycystic ovary syndrome\nor\nmetabolic syndrome\n. Your doctor will first want to rule out other conditions.\nDiagnosis is based on your medical history, a physical exam, and lab tests. Your doctor may ask if you are taking glucocorticoids or have had injections and rule that out before ordering lab tests.\nDoctors may use urine, saliva, or blood tests to diagnose Cushing’s syndrome. Sometimes doctors run a follow-up test to find out if excess cortisol is caused by Cushing’s syndrome or has a different cause.\nNo one test is perfect, so doctors usually do two of the following tests to confirm a diagnosis:\n24-hour urinary free-cortisol test\nIn this test, you will collect your urine over a 24-hour period. Your health care professional will send your urine sample to a lab to test cortisol levels. Higher than normal cortisol levels suggest Cushing’s syndrome.\nLate-night salivary cortisol test\nThis test measures the amount of cortisol in your saliva in the late evening. Normally, cortisol production drops just after we fall asleep. In Cushing’s syndrome, cortisol levels don’t drop. You can collect your saliva sample at home and return it to your health care professional or send it to a lab for testing.\nLow-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST)\nIn this test, you will take a low dose of dexamethasone, a type of glucocorticoid, usually around 11:00 p.m. A health care professional will draw your blood the following morning, usually around 8 a.m. Sometimes doctors use another type of LDDST test, in which you take dexamethasone every 6 hours for 48 hours. Your blood is drawn 6 hours after the last dose.\nNormally, cortisol levels in the blood drop after taking dexamethasone. Cortisol levels that don’t drop suggest Cushing’s syndrome.\nIn the LDDST test, you will have blood drawn after taking a low dose of dexamethasone.\nWhen one of the first blood tests show that your body has too much cortisol, your doctor may order a follow-up test, called the dexamethasone–corticotropin-releasing hormone (dexamethasone-CRH) test.\nDexamethasone–CRH test\nThe dexamethasone-CRH test shows whether excess cortisol is caused by Cushing’s syndrome or by something else.\nSome people have high cortisol levels off and on but don’t develop the long-term health effects of Cushing's syndrome. These people may have pseudo-Cushing's syndrome, a condition sometimes found in people who have depression or anxiety, drink too much alcohol, have diabetes with blood glucose levels that are often too high, or have obesity.\nThis test combines the LDDST and a CRH stimulation test. CRH is a hormone made in the part of the brain called the hypothalamus. CRH tells the pituitary to make ACTH, which in turn tells the adrenals to make cortisol.  When cortisol levels rise enough, they turn off the CRH signal, so ACTH and cortisol levels fall.\nCRH tells the pituitary to make ACTH, which in turn tells the adrenals to make cortisol.\nYou’ll get a shot of CRH and take dexamethasone by mouth. If you have pseudo-Cushing’s syndrome, the dexamethasone will decrease ACTH and cortisol levels and keep them from rising. Cortisol levels that are high just before the CRH shot or rise during this test suggest Cushing's syndrome.\nHow do doctors find the cause of Cushing’s syndrome?\nOnce your doctor diagnoses Cushing’s syndrome, other tests can help tell whether the source of the problem is pituitary, ectopic, or adrenal. Knowing the source is important in choosing the best type of treatment.\nBlood tests\nThe first step is to measure ACTH levels in the blood. If ACTH levels are low, the cause is probably an adrenal tumor. People with adrenal tumors don’t need further blood tests.\nIf ACTH levels are normal or high, the cause is probably a pituitary or ectopic tumor.\nOther blood tests help tell pituitary tumors from ectopic tumors. Doctors usually do more than one test.\nCRH stimulation test.\nFor this test, you’ll get a shot of CRH. If you have a pituitary tumor, CRH will increase the ACTH and cortisol in your blood. This rarely happens in people with ectopic tumors.\nHigh-dose dexamethasone suppression test (HDDST).\nThis test is the same as the LDDST, except it uses higher doses of dexamethasone. If the cortisol levels in your blood drop after taking a high dose of dexamethasone, you probably have a pituitary tumor. If your cortisol levels don’t drop, you may have an ectopic tumor.\nOther tests\nOther tests look for tumors and help tell pituitary tumors from ectopic tumors.\nImaging tests.\nImaging tests show the size and shape of the pituitary and adrenal glands and look for tumors. If blood tests show that the tumor is ectopic, imaging tests can help locate the tumor. The most common imaging tests are the\ncomputerized tomography (CT) scan\nand\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n.\nThe most common imaging tests are CT scans and MRI.\nPetrosal sinus sampling.\nPituitary tumors are usually small and may not show up in an imaging test. If an MRI doesn’t show a pituitary tumor, you might have petrosal sinus sampling. This test is often the best way to tell pituitary from ectopic causes of Cushing's syndrome.\nYour doctor will draw samples of blood from your petrosal sinuses—veins that drain the pituitary. At the same time, you will have a blood sample taken from a blood vessel far away from the pituitary. You will also get a shot of CRH, the hormone that causes the pituitary to release ACTH.\nHigher levels of ACTH in the blood from the petrosal sinuses than from the other blood vessel indicate a pituitary tumor. Similar levels of ACTH in all the blood samples suggest an ectopic tumor.\nHow do doctors treat Cushing’s syndrome?\nTreatment depends on the cause and may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or cortisol-reducing medicines. If the cause is long-term use of glucocorticoids to treat another disorder, your doctor will gradually reduce your dosage to the lowest dose that will control that disorder. Sometimes disorders that doctors treat with glucocorticoids can be treated with a non-glucocorticoid medicine instead.\nPituitary tumors\nThe most common treatment for pituitary tumors is surgery to remove the tumor. Using a special microscope and fine instruments, a surgeon approaches the pituitary gland through a nostril or an opening made below the upper lip. Your doctor will probably refer you to a center specializing in this type of surgery.\nThe success, or cure, rate of this surgery can be as high as 90 percent when done by a highly experienced surgeon.\n4\nIf surgery fails or the cure doesn’t last, surgery can be repeated, often with good results.\nSurgery to remove a pituitary tumor is usually successful with an experienced surgeon.\nAfter the surgeon removes the tumor, your pituitary won’t make enough ACTH for a while. Your doctor will prescribe cortisol medicine since there’s not enough ACTH to tell the adrenal glands to make enough cortisol. You may be able to stop cortisol medicine in 6 to 18 months.\nIf surgery fails or isn’t possible, radiation therapy is an option. One type of radiation therapy uses small doses of radiation to the pituitary over a 6-week period. Another type uses a single, high dose of radiation. Cortisol levels may not return to normal after radiation therapy for several years. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to bring cortisol levels back to normal until radiation therapy takes effect.\nEctopic ACTH-producing tumors\nThe first choice of treatment for ectopic tumors is to remove them surgically. If the tumor is cancerous and has spread, you may need chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other cancer treatments. Medicines to reduce cortisol levels may also be part of your treatment. If other treatments fail, surgeons might have to remove the adrenal glands to control Cushing’s syndrome.\nAdrenal tumors\nSurgery to remove the adrenal gland with the tumor is the most common treatment. Some rare diseases cause many nodules in both adrenal glands and require surgery to remove both glands. If you have both adrenal glands removed, you will need to take medicine for life to replace cortisol and other hormones the adrenal glands make.\nClinical Trials\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions.\nWhat are clinical trials, and are they right for you?\nClinical trials are part of clinical research and at the heart of all medical advances. Clinical trials look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease. Researchers also use clinical trials to look at other aspects of care, such as improving the quality of life for people with chronic illnesses.\nFind out if clinical trials are right for you\n.\nWhat clinical trials are open?\nClinical trials that are currently open and are recruiting can be viewed at\nwww.ClinicalTrials.gov\n.\n",
        "hallucinated_answer": "### Modified text ###: Adrenal gland hyperplasia occurs when the body's tissues are exposed to high levels of cortisol for too long. Many people develop adrenal gland hyperplasia because they take glucocorticoids-steroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolsuch as prednisone for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory diseases. Glucocorticoids are also used to suppress the immune system after transplantation to keep the body from rejecting the new organ or tissue.\n                \nOther people develop adrenal gland hyperplasia because their bodies produce too much cortisol. Normally, the production of cortisol follows a precise chain of events. First, the hypothalamus, a part of the brain about the size of a small sugar cube, sends corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to the pituitary gland. CRH causes the pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands. When the adrenals, which are located just above the kidneys, receive the ACTH, they respond by releasing cortisol into the bloodstream.\n                \nCortisol performs vital tasks in the body including\n                \n- helping maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function  - reducing the immune system's inflammatory response  - balancing the effects of insulin, which breaks down glucose for energy  - regulating the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats\n                \nOne of cortisol's most important jobs is to help the body respond to stress. For this reason, women in their last 3 months of pregnancy and highly trained athletes normally have high levels of the hormone. People suffering from depression, alcoholism, malnutrition, or panic disorders also have increased cortisol levels.\n                \nWhen the amount of cortisol in the blood is adequate, the hypothalamus and pituitary release less CRH and ACTH. This process ensures the amount of cortisol released by the adrenal glands is precisely balanced to meet the bodys daily needs. However, if something goes wrong with the adrenals or the regulating switches in the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, cortisol production can go awry.\n                \nPituitary Adenomas\n                \nPituitary adenomas cause 70 percent of Cushing's syndrome cases,1 excluding those caused by glucocorticoid use. These benign, or noncancerous, tumors of the pituitary gland secrete extra ACTH. Most people with the disorder have a single adenoma. This form of the syndrome, known as Cushing's disease, affects women five times more often than men.\n                \nEctopic ACTH Syndrome\n                \nEctopic ACTH syndrome occurs when tumors in the lung or pancreas secrete extra ACTH, leading to adrenal gland hyperplasia. These tumors are usually malignant and can spread to other parts of the body. Ectopic ACTH syndrome accounts for about 15-20% of Cushing's syndrome cases.\n                \nAdrenocortical Adenomas\n                \nAdrenocortical adenomas cause a rare form of adrenal gland hyperplasia. These tumors are benign and usually occur in women over the age of 40. They release excess cortisol into the bloodstream, leading to symptoms of Cushing's syndrome.\n                \nAdrenocortical Carcinoma\n                \nAdrenocortical carcinoma is a rare and aggressive form of adrenal cancer that can cause adrenal gland hyperplasia. The cancer cells secrete excess levels of several adrenocortical hormones, including cortisol and adrenal androgens, a type of male hormone. Adrenocortical carcinoma usually causes very high hormone levels and rapid development of symptoms.\n                \nFamilial Cushing's Syndrome\n                \nMost cases of Cushing's syndrome are not inherited. Rarely, however, Cushing's syndrome results from an inherited tendency to develop tumors of one or more endocrine glands. Endocrine glands release hormones into the bloodstream. With primary pigmented micronodular adrenal disease, children or young adults develop small cortisol-producing tumors of the adrenal glands. With multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), hormone-secreting tumors of the parathyroid glands, pancreas, and pituitary develop; Cushing's syndrome in MEN1 may be due to pituitary, ectopic, or adrenal tumors."

If the pancreas cant produce enough insulin due to beta cell dysfunction, gestational diabetes occurs.\n                \nAs with type 2 diabetes, excess weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Overweight or obese women are at particularly high risk for gestational diabetes because they start pregnancy with a higher need for insulin due to insulin resistance.

However, women who have gestational diabetes are more likely to develop gestational diabetes with future pregnancies and develop type 2 diabetes.3 Women with gestational diabetes should be tested for persistent diabetes 6 to 12 weeks after delivery and at least every 3 years thereafter.\n                \nAlso, exposure to high glucose levels during gestation increases a childs risk for becoming overweight or obese and for developing type 2 diabetes later on. The result may be a cycle of diabetes affecting multiple generations in a family. For both mother and child, maintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active may help prevent type 2 diabetes.",
        "context": "Symptoms & Causes of Diabetes\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetes?\nSymptoms of\ndiabetes\ninclude\nincreased thirst and urination\nincreased hunger\nfatigue\nblurred vision\nnumbness or tingling in the feet or hands\nsores that do not heal\nunexplained weight loss\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes can start quickly, in a matter of weeks. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly—over the course of several years—and can be so mild that you might not even notice them. Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms. Some people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes-related health problems, such as blurred vision or\nheart trouble\n.\nWhat causes type 1 diabetes?\nType 1 diabetes\noccurs when your immune system, the body’s system for fighting infection, attacks and destroys the\ninsulin\n-producing beta cells of the\npancreas\n. Scientists think type 1 diabetes is caused by\ngenes\nand environmental factors, such as viruses, that might trigger the disease. Studies such as\nTrialNet\nare working to pinpoint causes of type 1 diabetes and possible ways to prevent or slow the disease.\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes\n—the most common form of diabetes—is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes.\nOverweight, obesity, and physical inactivity\nYou are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you are not physically active and are\noverweight\nor have\nobesity\n. Extra weight sometimes causes\ninsulin resistance\nand is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and\nheart and blood vessel disease\n. To see if your weight puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes, check out these\nBody Mass Index (BMI) charts\n.\nInsulin resistance\nType 2 diabetes usually begins with\ninsulin resistance\n, a condition in which muscle,\nliver\n, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help\nglucose\nenter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can’t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.\nGenes and family history\nAs in type 1 diabetes, certain genes may make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. The disease tends to run in families and occurs more often in these racial/ethnic groups:\nAfrican Americans\nAlaska Natives\nAmerican Indians\nAsian Americans\nHispanics/Latinos\nNative Hawaiians\nPacific Islanders\nGenes also can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing a person’s tendency to become overweight or have obesity.\nWhat causes gestational diabetes?\nScientists believe\ngestational diabetes\n, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.\nInsulin resistance\nHormones\nproduced by the\nplacenta\ncontribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreas can’t make enough insulin.\nAs with type 2 diabetes, extra weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Women who are overweight or have obesity may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.\nHormonal changes, extra weight, and family history can contribute to gestational diabetes.\nGenes and family history\nHaving a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. Genes may also explain why the disorder occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asians, and Hispanics/Latinas.\nWhat else can cause diabetes?\nGenetic mutations\n, other diseases, damage to the pancreas, and certain medicines may also cause diabetes.\nGenetic mutations\nMonogenic diabetes\nis caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These changes are usually passed through families, but sometimes the gene mutation happens on its own. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by making the pancreas less able to make insulin. The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Neonatal diabetes occurs in the first 6 months of life. Doctors usually diagnose MODY during adolescence or early adulthood, but sometimes the disease is not diagnosed until later in life.\nCystic fibrosis\nproduces thick mucus that causes scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin.\nHemochromatosis\ncauses the body to store too much iron. If the disease is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\nHormonal diseases\nSome hormonal diseases cause the body to produce too much of certain hormones, which sometimes cause insulin resistance and diabetes.\nCushing’s syndrome\noccurs when the body produces too much\ncortisol\n—often called the “stress hormone.”\nAcromegaly\noccurs when the body produces too much growth hormone.\nHyperthyroidism\noccurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.\nDamage to or removal of the pancreas\nPancreatitis\n, pancreatic cancer, and trauma can all harm the beta cells or make them less able to produce insulin, resulting in diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\nMedicines\nSometimes certain medicines can harm beta cells or disrupt the way insulin works. These include\nniacin, a type of vitamin B3\ncertain types of diuretics, also called water pills\nanti-seizure drugs\npsychiatric drugs\ndrugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (\nHIV\n)\npentamidine, a drug used to treat\na type of pneumonia\nglucocorticoids—medicines used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n,\nasthma\n,\nlupus\n, and\nulcerative colitis\nanti-rejection medicines, used to help stop the body from rejecting a transplanted organ\nStatins, which are medicines to reduce LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels, can slightly increase the chance that you’ll develop diabetes. However, statins help protect you from heart disease and stroke.

        "context": "Nephrotic Syndrome in Adults\nWhat is nephrotic syndrome?\nNephrotic syndrome is a group of symptoms that indicate your\nkidneys\nare not working properly. These symptoms include\ntoo much\nprotein\nin your urine, called proteinuria\nlow levels of a protein called\nalbumin\nin your blood, called hypoalbuminemia\nswelling in parts of your body, called\nedema\nhigh levels of\ncholesterol\nand other lipids (fats) in your blood, called\nhyperlipidemia\nYour kidneys are made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron includes a filter, called the\nglomerulus\n, and a\ntubule\n. The glomerulus filters your blood, and the tubule returns needed substances to your blood and removes wastes and extra water, which become\nurine\n. Nephrotic syndrome usually happens when the glomeruli are\ninflamed\n, allowing too much\nprotein\nto leak from your blood into your urine.\nView full-sized image\nAs blood passes through healthy kidneys, the glomeruli filter out waste products and allow the blood to keep the cells and proteins the body needs.\nHow common is nephrotic syndrome?\nNephrotic syndrome is a combination of symptoms that can occur due to different causes. Among adults, the syndrome is most often caused by rare kidney diseases.\nWho is more likely to develop nephrotic syndrome?\nNephrotic syndrome can affect children and adults of all ages.\n1\nWhat are the complications of having nephrotic syndrome?\nNephrotic syndrome can lead to serious complications, including\n2\nblood clots that can lead to\nthrombosis\nhigher risk of infection caused by the loss of immunoglobulins, proteins in your blood that help fight viruses and bacteria\nhigh blood pressure\n, also called\nhypertension\nbrief or long-lasting kidney problems, including\nchronic kidney disease\nand\nkidney failure\nWhat are the symptoms of nephrotic syndrome?\nSymptoms of nephrotic syndrome can include\n3\npuffy eyelids and swelling in the legs, ankles, feet, lower abdomen, or other parts of your body\nfoamy urine\nweight gain due to retaining too much fluid\ntiredness\nloss of appetite\nWhat causes nephrotic syndrome?\nMany disorders can cause nephrotic syndrome, including diseases that affect only the kidneys and diseases that affect many parts of the body, such as\ndiabetes\nand\nlupus\n.\nKidney diseases\nDiseases that affect only the kidneys and lead to nephrotic syndrome are called primary causes of nephrotic syndrome. The most common primary causes of nephrotic syndrome are\n3\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis\n(FSGS).\nThis disease affects the kidney’s glomeruli, causing some of these filters to become scarred. FSGS is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in Black adults.\nMembranous nephropathy\n.\nThis disease causes protein to build up in a part of the kidney called the glomerular basement membrane. It is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in white adults.\nMinimal change disease\n.\nAlso called nil disease, this disease is the main cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Among adults, nephrotic syndrome is more common in older age.\nOther causes\nOther causes of nephrotic syndrome, also called secondary causes, include\n3\ndiabetes\nlupus\namyloidosis\ninfections, such as\nHIV/AIDS\n,\nhepatitis B\n, and\nhepatitis C\nsome allergic reactions\nsome medicines, such as\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\ngenetic disorders\nthat affect the kidneys\nHow do health care professionals diagnose nephrotic syndrome?\nYour health care professional can diagnose nephrotic syndrome through urine tests. The urine tests show if you are losing too much protein in your urine.\nTests for diagnosing nephrotic syndrome\nUrine dipstick test.\nThis simple test checks for albumin in your urine. Having albumin in the urine is called\nalbuminuria\n. You collect the urine sample in a container during a visit to a health care professional’s office or lab. A health care professional places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine for the test. The dipstick changes color if albumin is present in the urine.\nTo confirm the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, your health care professional may order one of these two urine tests\n24-hour urine collection.\nFor this test, you will need to collect urine samples over 24 hours. Your health care professional will then send the samples to a lab for analysis.\nUrine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR).\nThe UACR test uses a single urine sample to estimate the amount of albumin lost in 24 hours. The test measures both albumin and\ncreatinine\n, a waste product of normal muscle breakdown.\nYour health care professional may also order blood tests to check for low levels of protein in your blood and other problems linked to nephrotic syndrome.\nTests for identifying the cause\nOnce nephrotic syndrome has been diagnosed, your health care professional will use tests to identify what caused it and check your kidney function. Tests for finding the cause of nephrotic syndrome can include\n3\nblood tests\nimaging tests, such as a kidney\nultrasound\nkidney biopsy\nHow do health care professionals treat nephrotic syndrome?\nTreating symptoms and complications\nTreatment varies according to symptoms, causes, and the extent of kidney damage. Symptoms of nephrotic syndrome are most often treated with these medicines\n3\nan\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor\nor an\nangiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)\n. ACEs and ARBs can help reduce protein loss and also lower blood pressure, which is often high in people with nephrotic syndrome.\na\ndiuretic\n(water pill), which reduces swelling by helping the kidneys remove fluid from the blood.\nIn some cases, your health care professional may also prescribe medicines that lower cholesterol, called\nstatins\n.\nBlood thinners\nmay also be used, but usually only if you develop a blood clot.\nPeople with nephrotic syndrome should receive the\npneumococcal vaccine\n, along with yearly flu shots, to prevent viral and bacterial infections.\nTreating underlying causes\nOther treatments vary, depending on underlying causes. In some cases, you may need to take medicines that suppress your immune system. For more on how health care professionals treat the underlying causes of nephrotic syndrome, see the NIDDK health topic\nGlomerular Diseases\n.\nOnce the cause has been treated, nephrotic syndrome may go away and kidney function returns to normal. Some patients may experience periods of\nremission\nfollowed by times when symptoms reappear. In some cases, nephrotic syndrome may lead to\nkidney failure\n.\nHow does eating, diet, and nutrition affect nephrotic syndrome?\nEating, diet, and nutrition have not been shown to play a role in causing or preventing nephrotic syndrome. However, if you have developed nephrotic syndrome, your health care professional may recommend that you\nlimit intake of sodium (salt) and fluids to help control swelling\nreduce the amount of fat and cholesterol in your diet to help control your blood cholesterol levels\nClinical Trials for Nephrotic Syndrome\nThe NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including kidney diseases. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.\nWhat are clinical trials for nephrotic syndrome?\nClinical trials—and other types of\nclinical studies\n—are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help doctors and researchers learn more about disease and improve health care for people in the future.\nResearchers are studying many aspects of nephrotic syndrome, such as\nthe kidney diseases that can lead to nephrotic syndrome, including genes that may cause these diseases\nquality of life among people with nephrotic syndrome\nhow to best treat nephrotic syndrome\nFind out if clinical studies are right for you\n.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.\nWhat clinical studies for nephrotic syndrome are looking for participants?\nYou can view a filtered list of clinical studies on nephrotic syndrome that are federally funded, open, and recruiting at\nwww.ClinicalTrials.gov\n. You can expand or narrow the list to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the National Institutes of Health does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe. Always talk with your health care provider before you participate in a clinical study.\n",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Nephrotic syndrome involves the following: - proteinuria: large amounts of protein in the urine - hyperlipidemia: higher than normal fat and cholesterol levels in the blood - edema, or swelling, usually in the arms, hands, or face and less often in the legs, feet, or ankles - hypoalbuminemia: low levels of albumin in the blood - Primary causes of nephrotic syndrome are diseases that affect only the liver, such as hepatitis B. Secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome are diseases that affect many parts of the body, such as diabetes.\nIn addition to proteinuria, hyperlipidemia, edema, and hypoalbuminemia, people with nephrotic syndrome may experience - weight loss - fatigue - clear urine - increased appetite The loss of different proteins from the body can lead to a variety of complications in people with nephrotic syndrome. Treating nephrotic syndrome includes addressing the underlying cause and taking steps to reduce high blood pressure, edema, high cholesterol, and the risks of infection. Treatment usually includes medications and changes in diet."

        "context": "Low blood pressure occurs when blood flows through your blood vessels at lower than normal pressures. The medical term for low blood pressure is hypotension.\nBlood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of your\narteries\nas the heart pumps blood. It is usually described as two numbers:\nsystolic\nand\ndiastolic\n. The numbers record blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), with systolic listed above diastolic.\nFor most adults, a normal blood pressure is usually less than 120/80 mm Hg. Low blood pressure is blood pressure that is lower than 90/60 mm Hg.\nSome people have low blood pressure all the time, and it is normal for them. Other people experience a sudden drop in blood pressure or have low blood pressure that may be linked to a health problem. This can be dangerous, as it could mean your heart, brain, or other vital organs are not getting enough blood flow and you are at risk for a\nheart attack\nor\nstroke\n.\nWhat causes low blood pressure?\nMany systems of the body, including organs, hormones, and nerves, regulate blood pressure. For example, the\nautonomic nervous system\nsends the “fight-or-flight” signal that, depending on the situation, tells the heart and other systems in the body to increase or decrease blood pressure. Problems with the autonomic nervous system, such as in Parkinson’s disease, can cause low blood pressure.\nOther causes of low blood pressure include:\nBlood loss from an injury that causes a sudden drop in blood pressure\nDehydration\nDiabetes\nHeart problems such as\narrhythmias\n(irregular heartbeat)\nMedicines to treat\nhigh blood pressure\n, depression, or Parkinson’s\nPregnancy\nOlder adults also have a higher risk for symptoms of low blood pressure, such as falling, fainting, or dizziness upon standing up or after a meal. Older adults are more likely to develop low blood pressure as a side effect of medicines taken to control\nhigh blood pressure\n.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nFor many people, low blood pressure goes unnoticed. Others may feel symptoms such as:\nConfusion\nDizziness or lightheadedness\nFainting\nFeeling tired or weak\nBlurry vision\nHeadache\nNeck or back pain\nNausea\nHeart palpitations, or feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast\nWhat should you do if you have symptoms?\nSitting down may relieve the symptoms. If your blood pressure drops too low, your body’s vital organs do not get enough oxygen and nutrients. When this happens, low blood pressure can lead to\nshock\n, which requires immediate medical attention. Signs of shock include cold and sweaty skin, rapid breathing, a blue skin tone, or a weak and rapid pulse.\nCall 9-1-1\nif you notice signs of shock in yourself or someone else.\nTalk to your doctor about your symptoms. Your doctor will use a blood pressure test to diagnose low blood pressure. Other tests may include blood, urine, or imaging tests and a tilt table test if you faint often.\nHow is it treated?\nYou may not need treatment for low blood pressure. Depending on your symptoms, treatment may include drinking more fluids to prevent dehydration, taking medicines to raise your blood pressure, or adjusting medicines that cause low blood pressure.\nYour doctor may talk to you about lifestyle changes, including changing what and how you eat and how you sit and stand up. Your doctor may also recommend compression stockings if you stand for long periods.\nLearn more about\nLow Blood Pressure\nfrom the U.S. National Library of Medicine.",

        "question": "How to prevent Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis ?",
        "right_answer": "You can't prevent primary thrombocythemia. However, you can take steps to reduce your risk for complications. For example, you can control many of the risk factors for blood clots, such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking.\n                \nTo reduce your risk, quit smoking, adopt healthy lifestyle habits, and work with your doctor to manage your risk factors.\n                \nIt's not always possible to prevent conditions that lead to secondary thrombocytosis. But, if you have routine medical care, your doctor may detect these conditions before you develop a high platelet count.",
        "context": "What are thrombocythemia and thrombocytosis?\nWhat are they?\nThrombocythemia and thrombocytosis are conditions that occur when your blood has a higher-than-normal platelet count.\nPlatelets are tiny blood cells. They are made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells. When you are injured, platelets stick together to form a plug that seals your wound. This plug is called a blood clot. Platelets are also called thrombocytes,because a blood clot is also called a thrombus. If your platelet count is too high, blood clots can form in your blood vessels. This can block blood flow through your body.\nThrombocythemia\nrefers to a high platelet count that is not caused by another health condition. This condition is sometimes called primary or essential thrombocythemia.\nThrombocytosis\nrefers to a high platelet count caused by another disease or condition. This condition is often called secondary or reactive thrombocytosis. Thrombocytosis is more common than thrombocythemia.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nSymptoms\nMany people who have thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis do not have symptoms. These conditions might be discovered only after routine blood tests.\nThe symptoms of a high platelet count are linked to blood clots and bleeding. These symptoms are more common in people who have thrombocythemia.\nBlood clots\nIn thrombocythemia, blood clots most often develop in the brain, hands, and feet. But the clots can develop anywhere in the body. Blood clots in the brain may cause chronic (long-term) headaches and dizziness. In extreme cases, you may have a\ntransient ischemic attack\nor a stroke.\nYou may have blood clots in the tiny blood vessels of your hands and feet. This can make your hands and feet numb and red. You may have a burning feeling and throbbing pain, mostly in the palms of the hands and the soles of your feet.\nOther symptoms of a blood clot are:\nConfusion or changes in speech\nMigraines\nSeizures\nUpper body discomfort in one or both arms, your back, neck, jaw, or abdomen\nShortness of breath and nausea (feeling sick to your stomach)\nWeakness\nChest pain\nPregnancy complications\nYou may also have a spleen that is larger than normal.\nYou may have a higher chance of a blood clot if you are older, have had blood clots in the past, smoke, or have other health conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure.\nBleeding\nBleeding can happen in people who have a very high platelet count. You may have nosebleeds, bruising, bleeding from your mouth or gums, or blood in your stool.\nBleeding occurs when blood clots that develop in thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis use up your body’s platelets. This means that not enough platelets are left in your bloodstream to seal off cuts or breaks on the blood vessel walls. Bleeding can also happen if your platelets do not work properly.\nAnother cause of bleeding in people who have very high platelets counts is a condition called\nvon Willebrand disease\n. This condition affects how your blood clots.\nHow are they diagnosed?\nDiagonsis\nTo\ndiagnose thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis\n, your provider will ask about your medical and family history. They will ask about your symptoms and do a physical exam to look for signs of blood clots or bleeding.\nYour provider may also order one or more of the tests below.\nComplete blood count (CBC):\nA complete blood count (CBC) measures the levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood.\nBlood smear:\nFor this test, some of your blood is put on a slide. A microscope is used to look at your platelets and other blood cells.\nBone marrow tests\n:\nThese tests check whether your bone marrow is healthy.\nGenetic testing:\nThis test checks for mutations, or changes, in genes that control how your body makes platelets.\nWhat causes thrombocythemia?\nCauses of thrombocythemia\nThrombocythemia occurs when faulty cells in your bone marrow make too many platelets. Your platelets also do not work properly. Bone marrow is the sponge-like tissue inside the bones. It contains stem cells that develop into platelets and other blood cells. With primary thrombocythemia, a high platelet count may happen alone or with other blood cell disorders. This condition is not common.\nThrombocythemia is most often caused by your genes. Mutations, or changes, in the genes that control how your bone marrow forms platelets may cause thrombocythemia. Examples of such genes include\nJAK2\n,\nCALR\n, and\nMPL\n. Thrombocythemia can be inherited. This means the condition can be passed from parents to children.\nPrimary thrombocythemia is more common in people ages 50 to 70, but it can occur at any age. It is more common in women than in men.\nWhat causes thrombocytosis?\nCauses of thrombocytosis\nThrombocytosis occurs when another disease or condition causes you to have a high platelet count. People who have thrombocytosis have normal platelets and a lower risk of blood clots and bleeding than people who have thrombocythemia. Thrombocytosis is more common than thrombocythemia.\nSome conditions that can raise your risk of thrombocytosis are listed below.\nAnemia\n:\nIron-deficiency anemia and hemolytic anemia can cause thrombocytosis.\nCancer:\nMany people who have high platelet counts also have cancer — mostly lung,\ngastrointestinal\n, breast, or ovarian cancer or lymphoma. Sometimes a high platelet count is the first sign of cancer.\nSurgery to remove your spleen:\nThe spleen is an organ in your upper left abdomen. Normally, your spleen stores platelets. Removing your spleen can raise your platelet count.\nInflammation or infections:\nConditions such as\nconnective tissue disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, and tuberculosis can raise your platelet count.\nYour platelet count may be high for only a short time. This can be caused by:\nRecovery from serious blood loss\nRecovery from a very low platelet count caused by drinking too much alcohol and having low levels of vitamin B12 or folate\nAcute (short-term) infection or inflammation\nHow are thrombocythemia and thrombocytosis treated?\nTreatment and management\nPeople who have thrombocythemia with no symptoms often do not need\ntreatment\n. Other people who have this condition may need medicines or procedures to treat it. Treatment does not cure your condition, but it can help prevent blood clots and serious complications.\nTreatment for secondary thrombocytosis depends on its cause. People who have thrombocytosis usually do not need platelet-lowering medicines or procedures. This is because their platelets are usually normal and less likely to cause serious blood clots or bleeding.\nTreatment for thrombocythemia may include medicines and procedures.\nMedicines to lower platelet counts\nYou may need one of the following medicines to lower your platelet count.\nAnagrelide:\nThis medicine is used to lower platelet counts. It is mostly used when hydroxyurea does not work. Anagrelide also has side effects, such as fluid retention, palpitations,\narrhythmias\n,\nheart failure\n, and headaches.\nAspirin:\nThis medicine helps prevent blood clots. It is mostly used in people who have a low risk of blood clots. If you have a high risk of blood clots, you may need to take both aspirin and hydroxyurea.\nHydroxyurea:\nThis platelet-lowering medicine is used to treat cancers and sickle cell disease, for example.\nInterferon alfa:\nThis medicine lowers platelet counts, but it can have serious side effects. Side effects may include a flu-like feeling, decreased appetite, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), diarrhea, seizures, irritability, and sleepiness.\nProcedures\nPlateletpheresis is a procedure used to quickly lower your platelet count. This procedure is mostly used for emergencies. For example, if you are having a stroke due to primary thrombocythemia, you may need plateletpheresis.\nAn intravenous (IV) needle that is connected to a tube is placed in one of your blood vessels to remove blood. The blood goes through a machine that removes platelets from the blood. The remaining blood is then put back into you through an IV line in one of your blood vessels.\nWhat health problems can thrombocythemia and thrombocytosis cause?\nHealth problems they can cause\nThrombocythemia and thrombocytosis may cause blood clots which can block blood flow to your organs. This can lead to the following serious complications:\nVenous thromboembolism\nStroke and transient ischemic attacks\nReduced blood flow to your heart, which can cause a heart attack\nPregnancy complications\nThrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis can also cause your bone marrow to become scarred or to produce too many blood cells. This may lead to some types of\nleukemia\n.\nLearn how you can\nmanage these platelet disorders\nto help avoid complications.",

        "right_answer": "Medicines are the main treatment for Kawasaki disease. Rarely, children whose coronary (heart) arteries are affected may need medical procedures or surgery.\n                \nThe goals of treatment include:\n                \nReducing fever and inflammation to improve symptoms\n                \nPreventing the disease from affecting the coronary arteries\n                \nInitial Treatment\n                \nKawasaki disease can cause serious health problems. Thus, your child will likely be treated in a hospital, at least for the early part of treatment.\n                \nThe standard treatment during the disease's acute phase is high-dose aspirin and immune globulin. Immune globulin is a medicine that's injected into a vein.\n                \nMost children who receive these treatments improve greatly within 24 hours. For a small number of children, fever remains. These children may need a second round of immune globulin.\n                \nAt the start of treatment, your child will receive high doses of aspirin. As soon as his or her fever goes away, a low dose of aspirin is given. The low dose helps prevent blood clots, which can form in the inflamed small arteries.\n                \nMost children treated for Kawasaki disease fully recover from the acute phase and don't need any further treatment. They should, however, follow a healthy diet and adopt healthy lifestyle habits. Taking these steps can help lower the risk of future heart disease. (Following a healthy lifestyle is advised for all children, not just those who have Kawasaki disease.)\n                \nChildren who have had immune globulin should wait 11 months before having the measles and chicken pox vaccines. Immune globulin can prevent those vaccines from working well.\n                \nLong-Term Care and Treatment\n                \nIf Kawasaki disease has affected your child's coronary arteries, he or she will need ongoing care and treatment.\n                \nIt's best if a pediatric cardiologist provides this care to reduce the risk of severe heart problems. A pediatric cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in treating children who have heart problems.\n                \nMedicines and Tests\n                \nWhen Kawasaki disease affects the coronary arteries, they may expand and twist. If this happens, your child's doctor may prescribe blood-thinning medicines (for example, warfarin). These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming in the affected coronary arteries.\n                \nBlood-thinning medicines usually are stopped after the coronary arteries heal. Healing may occur about 18 months after the acute phase of the disease.\n                \nIn a small number of children, the coronary arteries don't heal. These children likely will need routine tests, such as:\n                \nEchocardiography. This test uses sound waves to create images of the heart.\n                \nEKG (electrocardiogram). This test detects and records the heart's electrical activity.\n                \nStress test. This test provides information about how the heart works during physical activity or stress.\n                \nMedical Procedures and Surgery\n                \nRarely, a child who has Kawasaki disease may needcardiac catheterization(KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun). Doctors use this procedure to diagnose and treat some heart conditions.\n                \nA flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in the arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to the heart. Through the catheter, doctors can perform tests and treatments on the heart.\n                \nVery rarely, a child may need to have other procedures or surgery if inflammation narrows his or her coronary arteries and blocks blood flow to the heart.\n                \nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), stent placement, or coronary artery bypass grafting(CABG) may be used.\n                \nCoronary angioplasty restores blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. A thin tube with a balloon on the end is inserted into a blood vessel in the arm or groin. The tube is threaded to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Then, the balloon is inflated to widen the artery and restore blood flow.\n                \nA stent (small mesh tube) may be placed in the coronary artery during angioplasty. This device helps support the narrowed or weakened artery. A stent can improve blood flow and prevent the artery from bursting.\n                \nRarely, a child may need to have CABG. This surgery is used to treat blocked coronary arteries. During CABG, a healthy artery or vein from another part of the body is connected, or grafted, to the blocked coronary artery.\n                \nThe grafted artery or vein bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked part of the coronary artery. This improves blood flow to the heart.",
        "context": "Vasculitis describes a group of rare conditions, also called angiitis, that damage blood vessels by causing\ninflammation\n, or swelling. Vasculitis can affect any size and type of blood vessel (arteries and veins), anywhere in the body.\nVasculitis is called primary when the cause cannot be identified. It is called secondary when something else causes it to occur.\nPotential triggers\nof this inflammation include infections, trauma, some drugs, and\nAutoimmune\ndisorders (diseases that cause your immune system to abnormally react against normal cells and tissues in your body). The inflamed lining (walls) of blood vessels may restrict or completely block blood flow, or it may cause formation of blood clots. In rare cases an inflamed vessel wall may balloon, forming an aneurysm with thin walls at risk of tearing.\nWith vasculitis, you may experience general\nsymptoms\n, such as fever, weight loss, tiredness, pain, and rash. You may have other symptoms depending on the part of the body that is affected and the severity of vasculitis. If you are\ndiagnosed\nwith vasculitis,\nmedicine\ncan help improve your symptoms and help you avoid\nflares\nand complications. With treatment, vasculitis can go into remission, which is a period of time when the disease is not active.\nTypes\nThere are many types of vasculitis. Each type affects different parts of the body and can lead to different symptoms. Some of the more common types are listed below.\nAnti-glomerular basement membrane disease\naffects blood vessels in the lungs and kidneys.\nBehçet’s disease\nmay affect many areas of the body, including the mouth, eyes, skin and genitals.\nBuerger’s disease\n,\nalso known as thromboangiitis obliterans, usually affects blood flow to the arms and legs.\nCentral nervous system vasculitis\n,\nalso called primary angiitis, affects the blood vessels (small arteries and veins) in the central nervous system: the brain, spinal cord, and the protective membranes that cover both. There are two types of central nervous system vasculitis.\nPrimary central nervous system vasculitis means the disease is located only in the central nervous system and not linked with other diseases.\nSecondary central nervous system vasculitis means the disease exists along with other\nAutoimmune\ndiseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, other forms of vasculitis, or infection.\nCogan’s syndrome\nis an autoimmune disorder that mainly affects the eyes and inner ears along with large blood vessels.\nCryoglobulinemic vasculitis\naffects the small blood vessels and is often linked with hepatitis C. It prevents proper blood flow and causes pain and damage to the skin, joints, peripheral nerves, kidneys, and liver.\nEosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis\n,\nalso known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, often affects the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, skin, heart and nervous system.\nGiant cell arteritis\n,\nalso known as temporal arteritis, mostly affects the\naorta\nand its major branches. The condition often affects the temporal artery in the head and may lower blood flow to the optic nerve, causing vision loss.\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis\nusually affects the nose and throat area, lungs, and kidneys.\nHypersensitivity vasculitis\naffects the skin. This condition also is known as allergic vasculitis, cutaneous vasculitis, or leukocytoclastic vasculitis.\nHypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis\nis linked with inflammation in the small blood vessels and low blood levels of certain proteins, which affects the body’s ability to develop defenses against infection.\nImmunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis\n,\nformerly known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura, is one of the most common types of vasculitis in children but can also affect adults. It develops when IgA, which is a type of\nantibodies\nthat usually helps defend the body against infections, builds up in blood vessels of the skin, joints, intestines, and kidneys. This causes inflammation and leakage of blood.\nKawasaki disease\nis a rare childhood disease that affects blood vessels throughout the body, commonly the coronary arteries. Kawasaki disease is also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome.\nMicroscopic polyangiitis\naffects small to medium-sized blood vessels, often including those in the kidneys and lungs.\nPolyarteritis nodosa\ncauses damage, including\naneurysm\n, most often to medium-sized arteries. This type of vasculitis may cause muscle and joint pain, kidney failure, high blood pressure, or symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\nRetinal vasculitis\naffects small blood vessels in the eye and can cause problems with vision.\nTakayasu arteritis\nmost often affects the aorta and its branches. The condition can also affect medium-sized arteries. It most frequently affects adolescent girls and young women and is more common in Asia.",

Rarely, surgery may be done. People who have mild vasculitis may find relief with over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen.\n                \nThe main goal of treating vasculitis is to reduce inflammation in the affected blood vessels. This usually is done by reducing or stopping the immune response that caused the inflammation.\n                \nTypes of Treatment\n                \nCommon prescription medicines used to treat vasculitis include corticosteroids and cytotoxic medicines.\n                \nCorticosteroids help reduce inflammation in your blood vessels. Examples of corticosteroids are prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone.\n                \nDoctors may prescribe cytotoxic medicines if vasculitis is severe or if corticosteroids don't work well. Cytotoxic medicines kill the cells that are causing the inflammation. Examples of these medicines are azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide.\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe both corticosteroids and cytotoxic medicines.\n                \nOther treatments may be used for certain types of vasculitis. For example, the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease is high-dose aspirin and immune globulin. Immune globulin is a medicine thats injected into a vein.\n                \nCertain types of vasculitis may require surgery to remove aneurysms that have formed as a result of the condition. (An aneurysm is an abnormal bulge in the wall of a blood vessel.)",
        "context": "Vasculitis describes a group of rare conditions, also called angiitis, that damage blood vessels by causing\ninflammation\n, or swelling. Vasculitis can affect any size and type of blood vessel (arteries and veins), anywhere in the body.\nVasculitis is called primary when the cause cannot be identified. It is called secondary when something else causes it to occur.\nPotential triggers\nof this inflammation include infections, trauma, some drugs, and\nAutoimmune\ndisorders (diseases that cause your immune system to abnormally react against normal cells and tissues in your body). The inflamed lining (walls) of blood vessels may restrict or completely block blood flow, or it may cause formation of blood clots. In rare cases an inflamed vessel wall may balloon, forming an aneurysm with thin walls at risk of tearing.\nWith vasculitis, you may experience general\nsymptoms\n, such as fever, weight loss, tiredness, pain, and rash. You may have other symptoms depending on the part of the body that is affected and the severity of vasculitis. If you are\ndiagnosed\nwith vasculitis,\nmedicine\ncan help improve your symptoms and help you avoid\nflares\nand complications. With treatment, vasculitis can go into remission, which is a period of time when the disease is not active.\nTypes\nThere are many types of vasculitis. Each type affects different parts of the body and can lead to different symptoms. Some of the more common types are listed below.\nAnti-glomerular basement membrane disease\naffects blood vessels in the lungs and kidneys.\nBehçet’s disease\nmay affect many areas of the body, including the mouth, eyes, skin and genitals.\nBuerger’s disease\n,\nalso known as thromboangiitis obliterans, usually affects blood flow to the arms and legs.\nCentral nervous system vasculitis\n,\nalso called primary angiitis, affects the blood vessels (small arteries and veins) in the central nervous system: the brain, spinal cord, and the protective membranes that cover both. There are two types of central nervous system vasculitis.\nPrimary central nervous system vasculitis means the disease is located only in the central nervous system and not linked with other diseases.\nSecondary central nervous system vasculitis means the disease exists along with other\nAutoimmune\ndiseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, other forms of vasculitis, or infection.\nCogan’s syndrome\nis an autoimmune disorder that mainly affects the eyes and inner ears along with large blood vessels.\nCryoglobulinemic vasculitis\naffects the small blood vessels and is often linked with hepatitis C. It prevents proper blood flow and causes pain and damage to the skin, joints, peripheral nerves, kidneys, and liver.\nEosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis\n,\nalso known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, often affects the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, skin, heart and nervous system.\nGiant cell arteritis\n,\nalso known as temporal arteritis, mostly affects the\naorta\nand its major branches. The condition often affects the temporal artery in the head and may lower blood flow to the optic nerve, causing vision loss.\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis\nusually affects the nose and throat area, lungs, and kidneys.\nHypersensitivity vasculitis\naffects the skin. This condition also is known as allergic vasculitis, cutaneous vasculitis, or leukocytoclastic vasculitis.\nHypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis\nis linked with inflammation in the small blood vessels and low blood levels of certain proteins, which affects the body’s ability to develop defenses against infection.\nImmunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis\n,\nformerly known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura, is one of the most common types of vasculitis in children but can also affect adults. It develops when IgA, which is a type of\nantibodies\nthat usually helps defend the body against infections, builds up in blood vessels of the skin, joints, intestines, and kidneys. This causes inflammation and leakage of blood.\nKawasaki disease\nis a rare childhood disease that affects blood vessels throughout the body, commonly the coronary arteries. Kawasaki disease is also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome.\nMicroscopic polyangiitis\naffects small to medium-sized blood vessels, often including those in the kidneys and lungs.\nPolyarteritis nodosa\ncauses damage, including\naneurysm\n, most often to medium-sized arteries. This type of vasculitis may cause muscle and joint pain, kidney failure, high blood pressure, or symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\nRetinal vasculitis\naffects small blood vessels in the eye and can cause problems with vision.\nTakayasu arteritis\nmost often affects the aorta and its branches.

Your age, lifestyle habits, and other medical conditions can raise your risk of a heart attack.\nSymptoms of a heart attack\ninclude chest and upper body pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, sweatiness, and nausea.\nWomen\noften experience different symptoms of a heart attack.\nIf you think you or someone else may be having a heart attack,\ncall 9-1-1 right away\n.\nActing fast can save your life. The longer the heart goes without enough oxygen, the more damage is done to the heart muscle.\nMany people survive and live active, full lives\nafter a heart attack\n. Getting help and treatment quickly can limit the damage to your heart.",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Lowering your risk factors for coronary heart disease can help you prevent a heart attack. Even if you already have coronary heart disease, you still can take steps to lower your risk for a stroke. These steps involve following a heart-healthy lifestyle and getting ongoing medical care.\n\nHeart-Healthy Lifestyle\n\nA heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent a stroke and includes heart-healthy eating, being physically active, quitting smoking, managing stress, and managing your weight.\n\nOngoing Care\n\nTreat Related Conditions\n\nTreating conditions that make a stroke more likely also can help lower your risk for a heart attack. These conditions may include:\n\nDiabetes (high blood sugar). If you have diabetes, try to control your blood sugar level through diet and physical activity (as your doctor recommends). If needed, take medicine as prescribed.\n\nHigh blood cholesterol. Your doctor may prescribe a statin medicine to lower your cholesterol if diet and exercise arent enough.\n\nHigh blood pressure. Your doctor may prescribe medicine to keep your blood pressure under control.\n\nHave an Emergency Action Plan\n\nMake sure that you have an emergency action plan in case you or someone in your family has a stroke. This is very important if youre at high risk for, or have already had, a stroke.\n\nWrite down a list of medicines you are taking, medicines you are allergic to, your health care providers phone numbers (both during and after office hours), and contact information for a friend or relative. Keep the list in a handy place (for example, fill out this wallet card) to share in a medical emergency.\n\nTalk with your doctor about the signs and symptoms of a stroke, when you should call 911, and steps you can take while waiting for medical help to arrive."

        "question": "What are the symptoms of Sickle Cell Disease ?",
        "right_answer": "Early Signs and Symptoms\n                \nIf a person has sickle cell disease (SCD), it is present at birth. But most infants do not have any problems from the disease until they are about 5 or 6 months of age. Every state in the United States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories requires that all newborn babies receive screening for SCD. When a child has SCD, parents are notified before the child has symptoms.\n                \nSome children with SCD will start to have problems early on, and some later. Early symptoms of SCD may include:\n                \nPainful swelling of the hands and feet, known as dactylitis\n                \nFatigue or fussiness from anemia\n                \nA yellowish color of the skin, known as jaundice, or whites of the eyes, known as icteris, that occurs when a large number of red cells hemolyze\n                \nThe signs and symptoms of SCD will vary from person to person and can change over time. Most of the signs and symptoms of SCD are related to complications of the disease.\n                \nMajor Complications of Sickle Cell Disease\n                \nAcute Pain (Sickle Cell or Vaso-occlusive) Crisis\n                \nPain episodes (crises) can occur without warning when sickle cells block blood flow and decrease oxygen delivery. People describe this pain as sharp, intense, stabbing, or throbbing. Severe crises can be even more uncomfortable than post-surgical pain or childbirth.\n                \nPain can strike almost anywhere in the body and in more than one spot at a time. But the pain often occurs in the\n                \nLower back\n                \nLegs\n                \nArms\n                \nAbdomen\n                \nChest\n                \nA crisis can be brought on by\n                \nIllness\n                \nTemperature changes\n                \nStress\n                \nDehydration (not drinking enough)\n                \nBeing at high altitudes\n                \nBut often a person does not know what triggers, or causes, the crisis. (See acute pain management.)\n                \nChronic Pain\n                \nMany adolescents and adults with SCD suffer from chronic pain. This kind of pain has been hard for people to describe, but it is usually different from crisis pain or the pain that results from organ damage.\n                \nChronic pain can be severe and can make life difficult. Its cause is not well understood. (See chronic pain management.)\n                \nSevere Anemia\n                \nPeople with SCD usually have mild to moderate anemia. At times, however, they can have severe anemia. Severe anemia can be life threatening. Severe anemia in an infant or child with SCD may be caused by:\n                \nSplenic sequestration crisis. The spleen is an organ that is located in the upper left side of the belly. The spleen filters germs in the blood, breaks up blood cells, and makes a kind of white blood cell. A splenic sequestration crisis occurs when red blood cells get stuck in the spleen, making it enlarge quickly. Since the red blood cells are trapped in the spleen, there are fewer cells to circulate in the blood. This causes severe anemia.  A big spleen may also cause pain in the left side of the belly. A parent can usuallypalpate or feel the enlarged spleen in the belly of his or her child.\n                \nA big spleen may also cause pain in the left side of the belly. A parent can usuallypalpate or feel the enlarged spleen in the belly of his or her child.\n                \nAplastic crisis. This crisis is usually caused by a parvovirus B19 infection, also called fifth disease or slapped cheek syndrome. Parvovirus B19 is a very common infection, but in SCD it can cause the bone marrow to stop producing new red cells for a while, leading to severe anemia.\n                \nSplenic sequestration crisis and aplastic crisis most commonly occur in infants and children with SCD. Adults with SCD may also experience episodes of severe anemia, but these usually have other causes.\n                \nNo matter the cause, severe anemia may lead to symptoms that include:\n                \nShortness of breath\n                \nBeing very tired\n                \nFeeling dizzy\n                \nHaving pale skin\n                \nBabies and infants with severe anemia may feed poorly and seem very sluggish. (See anemia management.)\n                \nInfections\n                \nThe spleen is important for protection against certain kinds of germs. Sickle cells can damage the spleen and weaken or destroy its function early in life.\n                \nPeople with SCD who have damaged spleens are at risk for serious bacterial infections that can be life-threatening. Some of these bacteria include:\n                \nPneumococcus\n                \nHemophilus influenza type B\n                \nMeningococcus\n                \nSalmonella\n                \nStaphylococcus\n                \nChlamydia\n                \nMycoplasma pneumoniae\n                \nBacteria can cause:\n                \nBlood infection (septicemia)\n                \nLung infection (pneumonia)\n                \nInfection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis)\n                \nBone infection (osteomyelitis)\n                \n(See how to prevent infections and infection management.)\n                \nAcute Chest Syndrome\n                \nSickling in blood vessels of the lungs can deprive a persons lungs of oxygen. When this happens, areas of lung tissue are damaged and cannot exchange oxygen properly. This condition is known as acute chest syndrome. In acute chest syndrome, at least one segment of the lung is damaged.\n                \nThis condition is very serious and should be treated right away at a hospital.\n                \nAcute chest syndrome often starts a few days after a painful crisis begins. A lung infection may accompany acute chest syndrome.\n                \nSymptoms may include:\n                \nChest pain\n                \nFever\n                \nShortness of breath\n                \nRapid breathing\n                \nCough\n                \n(See acute chest syndrome management.)\n                \nBrain Complications\n                \nClinical Stroke\n                \nA stroke occurs when blood flow is blocked to a part of the brain. When this happens, brain cells can be damaged or can die. In SCD, a clinical stroke means that a person shows outward signs that something is wrong. The symptoms depend upon what part of the brain is affected. Symptoms of stroke may include:\n                \nWeakness of an arm or leg on one side of the body\n                \nTrouble speaking, walking, or understanding\n                \nLoss of balance\n                \nSevere headache\n                \nAs many as 24 percent of people with hemoglobin SS and 10 percent of people with hemoglobin SC may suffer a clinical stroke by age 45.\n                \nIn children, clinical stroke occurs most commonly between the ages of 2 and 9, but recent prevention strategies have lowered the risk. (See Transcranial Doppler (TCD) Ultrasound Screening) and Red Blood Cell Transfusions.)\n                \nWhen people with SCD show symptoms of stroke, their families or friends should call 9-1-1 right away. (See clinical stroke management.)\n                \nSilent Stroke and Thinking Problems\n                \nBrain imaging and tests of thinking (cognitive studies) have shown that children and adults with hemoglobin SS and hemoglobin S0 thalassemia often have signs of silent brain injury, also called silent stroke. Silent brain injury is damage to the brain without showing outward signs of stroke.\n                \nThis injury is common. Silent brain injury can lead to learning problems or trouble making decisions or holding down a job. (See Cognitive Screening and silent stroke management.)\n                \nEye Problems\n                \nSickle cell disease can injure blood vessels in the eye.\n                \nThe most common site of damage is the retina, where blood vessels can overgrow, get blocked, or bleed. The retina is the light-sensitive layer of tissue that lines the inside of the eye and sends visual messages through the optic nerve to the brain.\n                \nDetachment of the retina can occur. When the retina detaches, it is lifted or pulled from its normal position. These problems can cause visual impairment or loss. (See Eye Examinations.)\n                \nHeart Disease\n                \nPeople with SCD can have problems with blood vessels in the heart and with heart function. The heart can become enlarged. People can also develop pulmonary hypertension.\n                \nPeople with SCD who have received frequent blood transfusions may also have heart damage from iron overload. (See transfusion management.)\n                \nPulmonary Hypertension\n                \nIn adolescents and adults, injury to blood vessels in the lungs can make it hard for the heart to pump blood through them. This causes the pressure in lung blood vessels to rise. High pressure in these blood vessels is called pulmonary hypertension. Symptoms may include shortness of breath and fatigue.\n                \nWhen this condition is severe, it has been associated with a higher risk of death. (See screening for pulmonary hypertension.)\n                \nKidney Problems\n                \nThe kidneys are sensitive to the effects of red blood cell sickling.\n                \nSCD causes the kidneys to have trouble making the urine as concentrated as it should be. This may lead to a need to urinate often and to have bedwetting or uncontrolled urination during the night (nocturnal enuresis). This often starts in childhood. Other problems may include:\n                \nBlood in the urine\n                \nDecreased kidney function\n                \nKidney disease\n                \nProtein loss in the urine\n                \nPriapism\n                \nMales with SCD can have unwanted, sometimes prolonged, painful erections. This condition is called priapism.\n                \nPriapism happens when blood flow out of the erect penis is blocked by sickled cells. If it goes on for a long period of time, priapism can cause permanent damage to the penis and lead to impotence.\n                \nIf priapism lasts for more than 4 hours, emergency medical care should be sought to avoid complications. (See priapism management.)\n                \nGallstones\n                \nWhen red cells hemolyze, they release hemoglobin. Hemoglobin gets broken down into a substance called bilirubin. Bilirubin can form stones that get stuck in the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small, sac-shaped organ beneath the liver that helps with digestion. Gallstones are a common problem in SCD.\n                \nGallstones may be formed early on but may not produce symptoms for years. When symptoms develop, they may include:\n                \nRight-sided upper belly pain\n                \nNausea\n                \nVomiting\n                \nIf problems continue or recur, a person may need surgery to remove the gallbladder.\n                \nLiver Complications\n                \nThere are a number of ways in which the liver may be injured in SCD.\n                \nSickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis is an uncommon, but severe, form of liver damage that occurs when sickled red cells block blood vessels in the liver. This blockage prevents enough oxygen from reaching liver tissue.\n                \nThese episodes are usually sudden and may recur. Children often recover, but some adults may have chronic problems that lead to liver failure.\n                \nPeople with SCD who have received frequent blood transfusions may develop liver damage from iron overload.\n                \nLeg Ulcers\n                \nSickle cell ulcers are sores that usually start small and then get larger and larger.\n                \nThe number of ulcers can vary from one to many. Some ulcers will heal quickly, but others may not heal and may last for long periods of time. Some ulcers come back after healing.\n                \nPeople with SCD usually dont get ulcers until after the age of 10.\n                \nJoint Complications\n                \nSickling in the bones of the hip and, less commonly, the shoulder joints, knees, and ankles, can decrease oxygen flow and result in severe damage. This damage is a condition called avascular or aseptic necrosis. This disease is usually found in adolescents and adults.\n                \nSymptoms include pain and problems with walking and joint movement. A person may need pain medicines, surgery, or joint replacement if symptoms persist.\n                \nDelayed Growth and Puberty\n                \nChildren with SCD may grow and develop more slowly than their peers because of anemia. They will reach full sexual maturity, but this may be delayed.\n                \nPregnancy\n                \nPregnancies in women with SCD can be risky for both the mother and the baby.\n                \nMothers may have medical complications including:\n                \nInfections\n                \nBlood clots\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nIncreased pain episodes\n                \nThey are also at higher risk for:\n                \nMiscarriages\n                \nPremature births\n                \nSmall-for-dates babies or underweight babies\n                \n(See pregnancy management.)\n                \nMental Health\n                \nAs in other chronic diseases, people with SCD may feel sad and frustrated at times. The limitations that SCD can impose on a persons daily activities may cause them to feel isolated from others. Sometimes they become depressed.\n                \nPeople with SCD may also have trouble coping with pain and fatigue, as well as with frequent medical visits and hospitalizations.

        "context": "Sickle cell disease is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders that affect hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen through the body. Normally, red blood cells are disc-shaped and flexible enough to move easily through the blood vessels. In sickle cell disease, red blood cells become crescent- or “sickle”-shaped due to a genetic mutation. These sickled red blood cells do not bend or move easily and can block blood flow to the rest of the body.\nThe blocked blood flow through the body can lead to serious problems, including\nstroke\n, eye problems, infections, and episodes of pain called pain crises.\nSickle cell disease is a lifelong illness. Until recently, a\nbone marrow transplant\nwas the only cure for sickle cell disease. However, in December 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved two new therapies to treat the disease. One approach adds a gene to the body and the other makes changes to a gene that is already in the body. NHLBI researchers are continuing to explore treatments that impact genes, but there are other types of\ntreatments\nthat can reduce\nsymptoms\nand prolong life. If you have sickle cell disease, your healthcare team will work with you on a treatment plan to reduce your symptoms and\nmanage the condition\n.\nThe condition affects more than 100,000 people in the United States and 20 million people worldwide. In the United States, most people who have sickle cell disease are of African ancestry or identify themselves as Black:\nAbout 1 in 13 Black or African American babies are born with\nsickle cell trait\n.\nAbout 1 in every 365 Black or African American babies are born with sickle cell disease.\nMany people who come from Hispanic, Southern European, Middle Eastern, or Asian Indian backgrounds also have sickle cell disease.\nThe NHLBI leads and supports research and clinical trials to find a cure for sickle cell disease.\nFACT SHEET\nSickle Cell Disease Fact Sheet\nLearn basics about sickle cell disease, including symptoms and treatment options.\nDownload the fact sheet",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) can affect different parts of the body, leading to a wide range of health problems. Some common complications include:\n\n1. Anemia: SCD causes the red blood cells to become misshapen and break down more rapidly, leading to anemia, or a lack of healthy red blood cells. This can cause fatigue, pale skin, and shortness of breath.\n\n2. Pain Crises: Painful episodes called pain crises can occur when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood vessels, cutting off oxygen supply to tissues and organs. Pain crises can be triggered by various factors such as infections, dehydration, or extreme temperatures.\n\n3. Organ Damage: Sickle cell crisis can lead to damage in vital organs like the lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and brain. This can result in long-term complications and organ failure.\n\n4. Lung Problems: People with SCD are at a higher risk of developing lung diseases such as pneumonia due to frequent respiratory infections. A condition called silent hypoxia can occur when sickle cells block blood flow to the lungs, causing low oxygen levels without any symptoms.\n\n5. Vision Problems: Blockages of blood vessels in the eyes can cause vision problems or even blindness. Regular eye examinations are essential for early detection and treatment of such issues.\n\n6. Heart Disease: People with SCD may develop heart problems due to enlargement of the heart muscle, high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension), or iron overload from frequent blood transfusions.\n\n7. Pulmonary Hypertension: In adolescents and adults with SCD, injury to blood vessels in the lungs can make it hard for the heart to pump blood through them, causing high pressure in lung blood vessels. This condition is called pulmonary hypertension and may lead to shortness of breath and fatigue.\n\n8. Kidney Problems: The kidneys are sensitive to the effects of red blood cell sickling, leading to issues such as difficulty concentrating urine, increased frequency of urination, blood in the urine, decreased kidney function, kidney disease, or protein loss in the urine.\n\n9. Priapism: Males with SCD can experience unwanted and sometimes prolonged painful erections, a condition known as priapism. If not treated promptly, priapism can cause permanent damage to the penis and lead to impotence.\n\n10. Gallstones: When red blood cells break down, they release hemoglobin, which gets converted into bilirubin. Bilirubin can form gallstones that get stuck in the gallbladder, causing symptoms such as upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n11. Liver Complications: Sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis is a severe form of liver damage caused by sickled red cells blocking blood vessels in the liver. People with frequent blood transfusions may also develop liver damage from iron overload.\n\n12. Leg Ulcers: Sickle cell ulcers are sores that usually start small and can grow larger over time. They are more common in individuals above the age of 10.\n\n13. Joint Complications: Sickling in bone joints, particularly in the hips, shoulders, knees, and ankles, can decrease oxygen flow and lead to severe damage called avascular necrosis. This can result in pain, joint deformity, and limited mobility.\n\n14. Delayed Puberty: SCD can cause delayed sexual maturity and may affect the onset of menstruation in females and growth spurts in both genders.\n\n15. Pregnancy Complications: Pregnancies in women with SCD are often complicated by health risks for both mother and baby, including infections, blood clots, high blood pressure, increased pain episodes, miscarriages, premature births, and small-for-dates babies or underweight infants.\n\n16. Mental Health: People with SCD may experience feelings of sadness, frustration, isolation, and depression due to the limitations that the disease imposes on their daily lives. They may also struggle with coping mechanisms for pain, fatigue, frequent medical visits, and hospitalizations."

        "question": "What is (are) Marfan Syndrome ?",
        "right_answer": "Marfan syndrome is a condition in which your body's connective tissue is abnormal. Connective tissue helps support all parts of your body. It also helps control how your body grows and develops.\n                \nMarfan syndrome most often affects the connective tissue of the heart and blood vessels, eyes, bones, lungs, and covering of the spinal cord. Because the condition affects many parts of the body, it can cause many complications. Sometimes the complications are life threatening.\n                \nOverview\n                \nMarfan syndrome is a genetic disorder. A mutation, or change, in the gene that controls how the body makes fibrillin causes Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin is a protein that plays a major role in your body's connective tissue.\n                \nMost people who have Marfan syndrome inherit it from their parents. If you have Marfan syndrome, you have a 50 percent chance of passing the altered gene to each of your children.\n                \nIn about 1 in 4 cases, the mutation that causes Marfan syndrome is not inherited. Thus, the affected person is the first in his or her family to have the condition.\n                \nMarfan syndrome often affects the long bones of the body. This can lead to signs, or traits, such as:\n                \nA tall, thin build.\n                \nLong arms, legs, fingers, and toes and flexible joints.\n                \nA spine that curves to one side. This condition is called scoliosis (sko-le-O-sis).\n                \nA chest that sinks in or sticks out. These conditions are called pectus excavatum (eks-ka-VA-tum) and pectus carinatum (ka-ri-NA-tum), respectively.\n                \nTeeth that are too crowded.\n                \nFlat feet.\n                \nMarfan syndrome traits vary from person to person, even in the same family. Some people who have the condition have many traits, while others have few.\n                \nThe most serious complications of Marfan syndrome involve the heart and blood vessels. Marfan syndrome can affect the aorta, the main blood vessel that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the body. In Marfan syndrome, the aorta can stretch and grow weak. This condition is called aortic dilation (di-LA-shun) or aortic aneurysm (AN-u-rism).\n                \nIf the aorta stretches and grows weak, it may tear or burst and leak blood. This condition is called aortic dissection. It's very serious and can lead to severe heart problems or even death.\n                \nMarfan syndrome has no cure, but treatments can help delay or prevent complications. Treatments include medicines, surgery, and other therapies. Limiting certain activities, or changing how you do them, may help reduce the risks to the aorta, eyes, and joints.\n                \nThe type of treatment you receive depends on how the condition is affecting your body.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nAbout 1 out of every 5,000 people in the United States has Marfan syndrome. Men, women, children, and people of all races can have the condition.\n                \nAdvances have been made in the early diagnosis and treatment of Marfan syndrome. It's now possible for people who have the condition to live longer and enjoy a good quality of life.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Marfan syndrome is a condition in which your body's connective tissue is abnormal. Connective tissue helps support all parts of your body. It also helps control how your body grows and develops.\n                \nMarfan syndrome most often affects the connective tissue of the heart and blood vessels, eyes, bones, lungs, and covering of the spinal cord. Because the condition affects many parts of the body, it can cause many complications. Sometimes the complications are life threatening.\n                \nOverview\n                \nMarfan syndrome is a genetic disorder. A mutation, or change, in the gene that controls how the body makes fibrillin causes Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin is a protein that plays a major role in your body's connective tissue.\n                \nMost people who have Marfan syndrome inherit it from their parents. If you have Marfan syndrome, you have a 50 percent chance of passing the altered gene to each of your children.\n                \nIn about 1 in 4 cases, the mutation that causes Marfan syndrome is not inherited. Thus, the affected person is the first in his or her family to have the condition.\n                \nMarfan syndrome often affects the long bones of the body. This can lead to signs, or traits, such as:\n                \nA tall, thin build.\n                \nLong arms, legs, fingers, and toes and flexible joints.\n                \nA spine that curves to one side. This condition is called scoliosis (sko-le-O-sis).\n                \nA chest that sinks in or sticks out. These conditions are called pectus excavatum (eks-ka-VA-tum) and pectus carinatum (ka-ri-NA-tum), respectively.\n                \nTeeth that are too crowded.\n                \nFlat feet.\n                \nMarfan syndrome traits vary from person to person, even in the same family. Some people who have the condition have many traits, while others have few.\n                \nThe most serious complications of Marfan syndrome involve the heart and blood vessels. Marfan syndrome can affect the aorta, the main blood vessel that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the body. In Marfan syndrome, the aorta can stretch and grow weak. This condition is called aortic dilation (di-LA-shun) or aortic aneurysm (AN-u-rism).\n                \nIf the aorta stretches and grows weak, it may tear or burst and leak blood. This condition is called aortic dissection. It's very serious and can lead to severe heart problems or even death.\n                \nMarfan syndrome has no cure, but treatments can help delay or prevent complications. Treatments include medicines, surgery, and other therapies. Limiting certain activities, or changing how you do them, may help reduce the risks to the aorta, eyes, and joints.\n                \nThe type of treatment you receive depends on how the condition is affecting your body.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nAbout 1 out of every 5,000 people in the United States has Marfan syndrome. Men, women, children, and people of all races can have the condition.\n                \nAdvances have been made in the early diagnosis and treatment of Marfan syndrome. It's now possible for people who have the condition to live longer and enjoy a good quality of life. Many people who have Marfan syndrome and are properly diagnosed and treated may live an average lifespan.\n                \nResearchers continue to study the condition and look for better treatments."

        "context": "A stroke can occur when blood flow to the brain is blocked or there is sudden bleeding in the brain. There are two types of strokes. A stroke that occurs because blood flow to the brain is blocked is called an ischemic stroke. The brain cannot get oxygen and nutrients from the blood. Without oxygen and nutrients, brain cells begin to die within minutes. A stroke that occurs because of sudden bleeding in the brain is called a hemorrhagic stroke. The leaked blood results in pressure on brain cells, damaging them.\nJust under 90% of strokes involve blocked blood vessels (ischemic), and the rest involve internal bleeding (hemorrhagic). Strokes are further classified based on where in the brain the blockage or bleeding occurs.\nA stroke is a medical emergency. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. Signs of a stroke can range from mild weakness to paralysis or numbness on one side of the face or body. Other signs may include a sudden and severe headache, sudden weakness, trouble seeing, and trouble speaking or understanding speech.\nIf you think you or someone else may be having a stroke, call 9-1-1 right away.\nDo not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you.

        "question": "Who is at risk for Overweight and Obesity? ?",
        "right_answer": "Being overweight or obese isn't a cosmetic problem. These conditions greatly raise your risk for other health problems.\n                \nOverweight and Obesity-Related Health Problems in Adults\n                \nCoronary Heart Disease\n                \nAs your body mass index rises, so does your risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\n                \nPlaque can narrow or block the coronary arteries and reduce blood flow to the heart muscle. This can cause angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) or a heart attack. (Angina is chest pain or discomfort.)\n                \nObesity also can lead to heart failure. This is a serious condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs.\n                \nHigh Blood Pressure\n                \nBlood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as theheart pumps blood. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage the body in many ways.\n                \nYour chances of having high blood pressure are greater if you're overweight or obese.\n                \nStroke\n                \nBeing overweight or obese can lead to a buildup of plaque in your arteries. Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture, causing a blood clot to form.\n                \nIf the clot is close to your brain, it can block the flow of blood and oxygen to your brain and cause a stroke. The risk of having a stroke rises as BMI increases.\n                \nType 2 Diabetes\n                \nDiabetes is a disease in which the body's blood glucose, or blood sugar, level is too high. Normally, the body breaks down food into glucose and then carries it to cells throughout the body. The cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy.\n                \nIn type 2 diabetes, the body's cells don't use insulin properly. At first, the body reacts by making more insulin. Over time, however, the body can't make enough insulin to control its blood sugar level.\n                \nDiabetes is a leading cause of early death, CHD, stroke, kidney disease, and blindness. Most people who have type 2 diabetes are overweight.\n                \nAbnormal Blood Fats\n                \nIf you're overweight or obese, you're at increased risk of having abnormal levels of blood fats. These include high levels of triglycerides and LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and low levels of HDL (\"good\") cholesterol.\n                \nAbnormal levels of these blood fats are a risk factor for CHD. For more information about triglycerides and LDL and HDL cholesterol, go to the Health Topics High Blood Cholesterol article.\n                \nMetabolic Syndrome\n                \nMetabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke.\n                \nYou can develop any one of these risk factors by itself, but they tend to occur together. A diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is made if you have at least three of the following risk factors:\n                \nA large waistline. This is called abdominal obesity or \"having an apple shape.\" Having extra fat in the waist area is a greater risk factor for CHD than having extra fat in other parts of the body, such as on the hips.\n                \nA higher than normal triglyceride level (or you're on medicine to treat high triglycerides).\n                \nA lower than normal HDL cholesterol level (or you're on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol).\n                \nHigher than normal blood pressure (or you're on medicine to treat high blood pressure).\n                \nHigher than normal fasting blood sugar (or you're on medicine to treat diabetes).\n                \nCancer\n                \nBeing overweight or obese raises your risk for colon, breast, endometrial, and gallbladder cancers.\n                \nOsteoarthritis\n                \nOsteoarthritis is a common joint problem of the knees, hips, and lower back. The condition occurs if the tissue that protects the joints wears away. Extra weight can put more pressure and wear on joints, causing pain.\n                \nSleep Apnea\n                \nSleep apnea is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.\n                \nA person who has sleep apnea may have more fat stored around the neck. This can narrow the airway, making it hard to breathe.\n                \nObesity Hypoventilation Syndrome\n                \nObesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people. In OHS, poor breathing results in too much carbon dioxide (hypoventilation) and too little oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia).\n                \nOHS can lead to serious health problems and may even cause death.\n                \nReproductive Problems\n                \nObesity can cause menstrual issues and infertility in women.\n                \nGallstones\n                \nGallstones are hard pieces of stone-like material that form in the gallbladder. They're mostly made of cholesterol. Gallstones can cause stomach or back pain.\n                \nPeople who are overweight or obese are at increased risk of having gallstones. Also, being overweight may result in an enlarged gallbladder that doesn't work well.\n                \nOverweight and Obesity-Related Health Problems in Children and Teens\n                \nOverweight and obesity also increase the health risks for children and teens. Type2 diabetes once was rare in American children, but an increasing number of children are developing the disease.\n                \nAlso, overweight children are more likely to become overweight or obese as adults, with the same disease risks.",
        "context": "Overweight and obesity are common conditions in the United States that are defined as the increase in size and amount of fat cells in the body. Overweight and obesity are caused by many factors including behaviors like eating patterns, lack of sleep or physical activity, and some medicines, as well as genetics and family history. Obesity is a chronic health condition that raises the risk for heart disease — the leading cause of death in the United States — and is linked to many other health problems, including type 2 diabetes and cancer.\nNearly 3 in 4 adults age 20 or older in the United States have either overweight or obesity. Nearly 1 in 5 children and teens ages 2 to 19 years have obesity. Overweight and obesity can lead to serious health issues for people of all ages.\nHealthcare providers use\nbody mass index (BMI)\nto screen for overweight and obesity in adults. BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight and is defined as the body mass (in kilograms) divided by the square of the body height (in meters) and expressed in units of kg/m². Your provider may talk to you about overweight and obesity if your BMI shows that your weight is above average for your height. But there is more to obesity than BMI.\nUnhealthy lifestyle habits, such as not getting enough physical activity and eating high-calorie, low-nutrient foods and beverages, can raise your\nrisk of overweight and obesity\n. Some people find that their weight goes up when they start taking medicine for another health condition such as diabetes, depression, or\nhigh blood pressure\n. Talk to your provider before you consider stopping any medicine you are taking for another condition that you think is also impacting your weight.\nLifestyle changes that can reduce weight include following a heart-healthy eating plan lower in calories and unhealthy saturated fats and increasing physical activity.

        "question": "What causes Sleep Apnea ?",
        "right_answer": "When you're awake, throat muscles help keep your airway stiff and open so air can flow into your lungs. When you sleep, these muscles relax, which narrows your throat.\n                \nNormally, this narrowing doesnt prevent air from flowing into and out of your lungs. But if you have sleep apnea, your airway can become partially or fully blocked because:\n                \nYour throat muscles and tongue relax more than normal.\n                \nYour tongue and tonsils (tissue masses in the back of your mouth) are large compared with the opening into your windpipe.\n                \nYou're overweight. The extra soft fat tissue can thicken the wall of the windpipe. This narrows the inside of the windpipe, which makes it harder to keep open.\n                \nThe shape of your head and neck (bony structure) may cause a smaller airway size in the mouth and throat area.\n                \nThe aging process limits your brain signals' ability to keep your throat muscles stiff during sleep. Thus, your airway is more likely to narrow or collapse.\n                \nNot enough air flows into your lungs if your airway is partially or fully blocked during sleep. As a result, loud snoring and a drop in your blood oxygen level can occur.\n                \nIf the oxygen drops to a dangerous level, it triggers your brain to disturb your sleep. This helps tighten the upper airway muscles and open your windpipe. Normal breathing then starts again, often with a loud snort or choking sound.\n                \nFrequent drops in your blood oxygen level and reduced sleep quality can trigger the release of stress hormones. These hormones raise your heart rate and increase your risk for high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). The hormones also can raise your risk for, or worsen, heart failure.\n                \nUntreated sleep apnea also can lead to changes in how your body uses energy. These changes increase your risk for obesity and diabetes.",
        "context": "Sleep apnea is a common condition in which your breathing stops and restarts many times while you sleep. This can prevent your body from getting enough oxygen. You may want to talk to your healthcare provider about sleep apnea if someone tells you that you snore or gasp during sleep, or if you experience other\nsymptoms\nof poor-quality sleep, such as excessive daytime sleepiness.\nThere are two types of sleep apnea.\nObstructive sleep apnea\nhappens when your upper airway becomes blocked many times while you sleep, reducing or completely stopping airflow. This is the most common type of sleep apnea. Anything that could narrow your airway such as\nobesity\n, large tonsils, or changes in your\nhormone\nlevels can increase\nyour risk\nfor obstructive sleep apnea.\nCentral sleep apnea\nhappens when your brain does not send the signals needed to breathe.

        "hallucinated_answer": "During wakefulness, laryngeal muscles facilitate respiration by maintaining airway patency and stiffness. However, upon sleep onset, these muscles undergo relaxation, causing narrowing of the pharynx. This constriction ordinarily does not obstruct respiratory flow. Nevertheless, in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), it can lead to partial or complete airway obstruction due to:\n1. Hyper-relaxation of pharyngeal muscles and the tongue.\n2. Enlarged tongue and palatine tonsils relative to the trachea's caliber.\n3. Obesity, which results in increased fat deposition surrounding the airway, further narrowing it.\n4. Anatomical factors such as brachycephaly and micrognathia that predispose an individual to a smaller pharyngeal size.\n5. Senescence of the upper airway musculature, which impairs their ability to maintain patency during sleep.\nDecreased oxygenation ensues if the airway is partially or fully occluded during sleep, leading to snoring and hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels). These conditions disrupt the sleep cycle by activating arousal mechanisms in the central nervous system that reinforce upper airway muscle tone, alleviating obstruction temporarily.\nPersistent episodes of desaturation and fragmented sleep can trigger the release of stress hormones (e.g., cortisol) that elevate cardiovascular risks by increasing heart rate, promoting hypertension, and precipitating arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Moreover, these hormonal perturbations can exacerbate pre-existing heart failure and increase susceptibility to obesity and metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus."

(\"Sedated\" means you're given medicine to make you sleepy.)\n                \nWhen germs reach your lungs, your immune system goes into action. It sends many kinds of cells to attack the germs. These cells cause the alveoli (air sacs) to become red and inflamed and to fill up with fluid and pus. This causes the symptoms of pneumonia.\n                \nGerms That Can Cause Pneumonia\n                \nBacteria\n                \nBacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia in adults. Some people, especially the elderly and those who are disabled, may get bacterial pneumonia after having the flu or even a common cold.\n                \nMany types of bacteria can cause pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own or develop after you've had a cold or the flu. This type of pneumonia often affects one lobe, or area, of a lung. When this happens, the condition is called lobar pneumonia.\n                \nThe most common cause of pneumonia in the United States is the bacterium Streptococcus (strep-to-KOK-us) pneumoniae, or pneumococcus (nu-mo-KOK-us).\n                \nLobar Pneumonia\n                \n\n                \nAnother type of bacterial pneumonia is called atypical pneumonia. Atypical pneumonia includes:\n                \nLegionella pneumophila. This type of pneumonia sometimes is called Legionnaire's disease, and it has caused serious outbreaks. Outbreaks have been linked to exposure to cooling towers, whirlpool spas, and decorative fountains.\n                \nMycoplasma pneumonia. This is a common type of pneumonia that usually affects people younger than 40 years old. People who live or work in crowded places like schools, homeless shelters, and prisons are at higher risk for this type of pneumonia. It's usually mild and responds well to treatment with antibiotics. However, mycoplasma pneumonia can be very serious. It may be associated with a skin rash and hemolysis (the breakdown of red blood cells).\n                \nChlamydophila pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur all year and often is mild. The infection is most common in people 65 to 79 years old.\n                \nViruses\n                \nRespiratory viruses cause up to one-third of the pneumonia cases in the United States each year. These viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years old.\n                \nMost cases of viral pneumonia are mild. They get better in about 1 to 3 weeks without treatment. Some cases are more serious and may require treatment in a hospital.\n                \nIf you have viral pneumonia, you run the risk of getting bacterial pneumonia as well.\n                \nThe flu virus is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults. Other viruses that cause pneumonia include respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, herpes simplex virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and more.\n                \nFungi\n                \nThree types of fungi in the soil in some parts of the United States can cause pneumonia. These fungi are:\n                \nCoccidioidomycosis (kok-sid-e-OY-do-mi-KO-sis). This fungus is found in Southern California and the desert Southwest.\n                \nHistoplasmosis (HIS-to-plaz-MO-sis). This fungus is found in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys.\n                \nCryptococcus (krip-to-KOK-us). This fungus is found throughout the United States in bird droppings and soil contaminated with bird droppings.\n                \nMost people exposed to these fungi don't get sick, but some do and require treatment.\n                \nSerious fungal infections are most common in people who have weak immune systems due to the long-term use of medicines to suppress their immune systems or having HIV/AIDS.\n                \nPneumocystis jiroveci (nu-mo-SIS-tis ye-RO-VECH-e), formerly Pneumocystis carinii, sometimes is considered a fungal pneumonia. However, it's not treated with the usual antifungal medicines. This type of infection is most common in people who:\n                \nHave HIV/AIDS or cancer\n                \nHave had an organ transplant and/or blood and marrow stem cell transplant\n                \nTake medicines that affect their immune systems\n                \nOther kinds of fungal infections also can lead to pneumonia.",

        "hallucinated_answer": "Pneumonia is typically caused by various germs, including bacteria, viruses and, less frequently, fungi. Most of the time, our immune system filters out these pathogens from the air we breathe to prevent infection of the lungs. This process involves a complex interaction between your immune cells, nose and throat anatomy, coughing reflex, and cilia, which are hair-like structures that move mucus and trapped germs out of the airways (For more information about lung function, visit the How the Lungs Work article).\nHowever, sometimes these germs manage to enter the lungs and cause infections. This is more likely when:\nThe immune system is weakened or compromised\nA germ is highly virulent\nOur respiratory defenses fail to filter out pathogens effectively\nFor instance, if you are unable to cough due to a stroke or sedation (which means that you have been given medication to induce sleep), germs may accumulate in your airways.\nWhen germs reach the lungs, they trigger an immune response involving multiple cell types that attack the pathogens. These cells can cause inflammation and fill up the alveoli (air sacs) with fluid and pus, leading to symptoms of pneumonia.\nMany different types of bacteria can cause pneumonia, making it the most common bacterial infection in adults. Some individuals, especially those who are elderly or disabled, may develop bacterial pneumonia after having influenza or a simple cold. Bacterial forms of this illness often affect one lobe (area) of a lung, resulting in what is known as lobar pneumonia. The leading cause of bacterial pneumonia in the US is Streptococcus pneumoniae, also called pneumococcus.\nAnother type of bacterial pneumonia is atypical pneumonia, which includes:\nLegionella pneumophila - responsible for Legionnaire's disease outbreaks linked to contaminated water systems such as cooling towers or decorative fountains\nMycoplasma pneumonia - a common form of the illness that typically affects people under 40 years old, often associated with crowded living/working conditions like schools and prisons. It usually responds well to antibiotics but can sometimes be severe and cause hemolysis (red blood cell breakdown)\nChlamydophila pneumoniae - generally milder, more common in older individuals (65-79 years old).\nViral pathogens are responsible for up to one-third of all cases of pneumonia. The most prevalent cause is the influenza virus in adults; other viruses that can lead to this illness include respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, herpes simplex virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and others. Coinfection with bacterial pathogens increases risk for complications.\nThree types of soil-dwelling fungi found in specific regions across the United States can cause pneumonia: Coccidioidomycosis (in Southern California and desert Southwest), Histoplasmosis (Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys), and Cryptococcus (nationwide, commonly associated with bird droppings-contaminated soil). While most people exposed to these fungi don't develop infections, some may require treatment.\nSerious fungal lung infections are more common among immunocompromised individuals who have weakened immune systems due to long-term use of immunosuppressive medications or conditions like HIV/AIDS. Additionally, organ transplant recipients and those undergoing bone marrow stem cell transplants also face an elevated risk for these types of infections."

        "right_answer": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) has no cure. However, treatment may help relieve symptoms and slow the progress of the disease.\n                \nPH is treated with medicines, procedures, and other therapies. Treatment will depend on what type of PH you have and its severity. (For more information, go to \"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\")\n                \nGroup 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension\n                \nGroup 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) includes PH that's inherited, that has no known cause, or that's caused by certain drugs or conditions. Treatments for group 1 PAH include medicines and medical procedures.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to relax the blood vessels in your lungs and reduce excess cell growth in the blood vessels. As the blood vessels relax, more blood can flow through them.\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines that are taken by mouth, inhaled, or injected.\n                \nExamples of medicines for group 1 PAH include:\n                \nPhosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil\n                \nProstanoids, such as epoprostenol\n                \nEndothelin receptor antagonists, such as bosentan and ambrisentan\n                \nCalcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem\n                \nYour doctor may prescribe one or more of these medicines. To find out which of these medicines works best, you'll likely have an acute vasoreactivity test. This test shows how the pressure in your pulmonary arteries reacts to certain medicines. The test is done during right heart catheterization.\n                \nMedical and Surgical Procedures\n                \nIf you have group 1 PAH, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following procedures.\n                \nAtrial septostomy (sep-TOS-toe-me). For this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your leg and threaded to your heart. The tube is then put through the wall that separates your right and left atria (the upper chambers of your heart). This wall is called the septum.\n                \nA tiny balloon on the tip of the tube is inflated. This creates an opening between the atria. This procedure relieves the pressure in the right atria and increases blood flow. Atrial septostomy is rarely done in the United States.\n                \nLung transplant. A lung transplant is surgery to replace a person's diseased lung with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. This procedure may be used for people who have severe lung disease that's causing PAH.\n                \nHeartlung transplant. A heartlung transplant is surgery in which both the heart and lung are replaced with healthy organs from a deceased donor.\n                \nGroup 2 Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nConditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease, can cause group 2 PH. Treating the underlying condition will help treat PH. Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medicines, and surgery.\n                \nGroup 3 Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nLung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial lung disease, can cause group 3 PH. Certain sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, also can cause group 3 PH.\n                \nIf you have this type of PH, you may need oxygen therapy. This treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood. You'll likely get the oxygen through soft, plastic prongs that fit into your nose. Oxygen therapy can be done at home or in a hospital.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend other treatments if you have an underlying lung disease.\n                \nGroup 4 Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nBlood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders can cause group 4 PH. If you have this type of PH, your doctor will likely prescribe blood-thinning medicines. These medicines prevent clots from forming or getting larger.\n                \nSometimes doctors use surgery to remove scarring in the pulmonary arteries due to old blood clots.\n                \nGroup 5 Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nVarious diseases and conditions, such as thyroid disease and sarcoidosis, can cause group 5 PH. An object, such as a tumor, pressing on the pulmonary arteries also can cause group 5 PH.\n                \nGroup 5 PH is treated by treating its cause.\n                \nAll Types of Pulmonary Hypertension\n                \nSeveral treatments may be used for all types of PH. These treatments include:\n                \nDiuretics, also called water pills. These medicines help reduce fluid buildup in your body, including swelling in your ankles and feet.\n                \nBlood-thinning medicines. These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming or getting larger.\n                \nDigoxin. This medicine helps the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. Digoxin sometimes is used to control the heart rate if abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, occur.\n                \nOxygen therapy. This treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood.\n                \nPhysical activity. Regular activity may help improve your ability to be active. Talk with your doctor about a physical activity plan that's safe for you.\n                \nResearch is ongoing for better PH treatments. These treatments offer hope for the future.",

Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.\n                \nSaturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:\n                \n1,200 calories a day\n                \n8 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,500 calories a day\n                \n10 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n1,800 calories a day\n                \n12 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,000 calories a day\n                \n13 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \n2,500 calories a day\n                \n17 grams of saturated fat a day\n                \nNot all fats are bad.

One drink is:\n                \n12 ounces of beer\n                \n5 ounces of wine\n                \n1 ounces of liquor\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nMaintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.\n                \nKnowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:\n                \nBelow 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.\n                \nBetween 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.\n                \nBetween 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.\n                \nA BMI of 30.0 or higher is considered obese.\n                \nA general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.\n                \nMeasuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk. For more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, visit Aim for a Healthy Weight.\n                \nIf youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:\n                \nA stress management program\n                \nMeditation\n                \nPhysical activity\n                \nRelaxation therapy\n                \nTalking things out with friends or family\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRegular physical activity can lower many atherosclerosis risk factors, including LDL or bad cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL or good cholesterol, which helps prevent atherosclerosis.\n                \nEveryone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.\n                \nTalk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.

Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nFor more information about how to quit smoking, visit Smoking and Your Heart.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nSometimes lifestyle changes alone arent enough to control your cholesterol levels. For example, you also may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:\n                \nCoronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a prior stroke\n                \nDiabetes\n                \nHigh LDL cholesterol levels\n                \nDoctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with people who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to:\n                \nLower your blood pressure\n                \nLower your blood sugar levels\n                \nPrevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack and stroke\n                \nPrevent inflammation\n                \nTake all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your atherosclerosis.\n                \nMedical Procedures and Surgery\n                \nIf you have severe atherosclerosis, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure or surgery.\n                \nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, is a procedure thats used to open blocked or narrowed coronary (heart) arteries. PCI can improve blood flow to the heart and relieve chest pain. Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to keep it open after the procedure.\n                \nCoronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a type of surgery. In CABG, arteries or veins from other areas in your body are used to bypass or go around your narrowed coronary arteries. CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.\n                \nBypass grafting also can be used for leg arteries. For this surgery, a healthy blood vessel is used to bypass a narrowed or blocked artery in one of the legs. The healthy blood vessel redirects blood around the blocked artery, improving blood flow to the leg.\n                \nCarotid endarterectomy is a type of surgery to remove plaque buildup from the carotid arteries in the neck. This procedure restores blood flow to the brain, which can help prevent a stroke.",
        "context": "Atherosclerosis is a common condition that develops when a sticky substance called plaque builds up inside your\narteries\n. Disease linked to atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in the United States.\nAtherosclerosis develops slowly as cholesterol, fat, blood cells and other substances in your blood form plaque. When the plaque builds up, it causes your arteries to narrow. This reduces the supply of oxygen-rich blood to tissues of vital organs in the body.\nNormal artery and an artery with plaque buildup.\nAtherosclerosis can affect most of the arteries in the body, including arteries in the heart, brain, arms, legs, pelvis, and kidneys. It has different names based on which arteries are affected.\nCoronary artery disease (CAD)\nis plaque buildup in the arteries of your\nheart.\nPeripheral artery disease (PAD)\nmost often is plaque buildup in\nthe\narteries of the legs, but it can also build up in your arms or pelvis.\nCarotid artery disease\nis plaque buildup in the neck arteries. It reduces blood flow to the brain.\nRenal artery stenosis\nis plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to your kidneys.\nVertebral artery disease\nis atherosclerosis in the arteries that supply blood to the back of the brain. This area of the brain controls body functions that are needed to keep you alive.\nRead more about disorders affecting blood supply to the back of the brain.\nMesenteric artery\nIschemia\nis plaque buildup in the arteries that supply the\nintestines with blood. Learn more about\nplaque buildup in the mesenteric arteries\n.\nReduced blood flow can lead to\nsymptoms\nsuch as\nangina\n. If a plaque bursts, a\nblood clots\nmay form that may block the artery completely or travel to other parts of the body. Blockages, either complete or incomplete, can cause complications, including\nheart attack\n,\nstroke\n,\nvascular dementia\n,\nerectile dysfunction\n, or limb loss. Atherosclerosis can cause death and disability.\nConfused about terms?\nAthero\nsclerosis is not the same as\narterio\nsclerosis, which refers to “hardening of the arteries,” which means the arteries thicken and lose flexibility. Arteriosclerosis has several different causes. Atherosclerosis, which develops from fatty plaque buildup, is a common type of arteriosclerosis.\nPlaque often starts to build up during childhood and gets worse with age.\nRisk factors\ninclude unhealthy cholesterol levels, unhealthy lifestyle habits, and your\ngene\n.\nThe good news is that most people can\nprevent\nor delay the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis by following steps for\nheart-healthy living\n.",
        "hallucinated_answer": "To maintain heart health and reduce your risk of developing atherosclerosis, follow these lifestyle recommendations:\n\nEat a Heart-Healthy Diet: Consume a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, low-fat dairy products, and healthy fats. Limit foods high in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt, and added sugars. Also, pay attention to portion sizes.\n\nReduce Salt Intake: Try to avoid or reduce the consumption of processed and packaged foods that are high in salt. When cooking, use low-sodium ingredients and seasonings. Aim for a daily sodium intake of no more than 2,300 milligrams; if you have hypertension, you may need to restrict it further.\n\nTry the DASH Diet: If your doctor recommends it, follow the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan. This diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products while limiting saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt, and added sugars.\n\nMaintain a Healthy Weight: Excess weight can increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis. Work with your doctor to determine the ideal weight for you and develop a plan that includes regular physical activity and a balanced diet to achieve and maintain this weight.\n\nExercise Regularly: Engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, as well as muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days per week.\n\nDo Not Smoke: If you smoke or use tobacco products, quit immediately. Smoking damages blood vessels and increases your risk of atherosclerosis. Talk to your doctor about medications, support groups, or classes that can help you quit smoking. Avoid secondhand smoke as well.\n\nManage Stress: High stress levels can contribute to heart disease development. Develop healthy coping mechanisms like meditation, yoga, or seeking professional counseling if needed.\n\nTake Medications as Prescribed: If lifestyle changes alone are not enough to control your cholesterol levels, your doctor may prescribe medications such as statins. Take all prescribed medications regularly and as directed by your healthcare provider.\n\nConsider Medical Procedures or Surgery if Necessary: In cases of severe atherosclerosis, your doctor may recommend percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), carotid endarterectomy, or other procedures to improve blood flow and reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other complications.\n\nBy following these lifestyle recommendations"
