        "question": "Do you have information about Dental x-rays",
        "right_answer": "Dental x-rays are a type of image of the teeth and mouth. X-rays are a form of high energy electromagnetic radiation. The x-rays penetrate the body to form an image on film or screen. X-rays can be either digital or developed on a film. Structures that are dense (such as silver fillings or metal restoration) will block most of the light energy from the x-ray. This makes them appear white in the image. Structures that contain air will be black, and teeth, tissue, and fluid will appear as shades of gray.",
        "context": "Dental x-rays are a type of image of the teeth and mouth. X-rays are a form of high energy electromagnetic radiation. The x-rays penetrate the body to form an image on film or screen. X-rays can be either digital or developed on a film.\nStructures that are dense (such as silver fillings or metal restoration) will block most of the light energy from the x-ray. This makes them appear white in the image. Structures that contain air will be black, and teeth, tissue, and fluid will appear as shades of gray.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is performed in the dentist's office. There are many types of dental x-rays. Some of them are:\nBitewing. Shows the crown portions of the top and bottom teeth together when the person bites on a biting tab.\nPeriapical. Shows 1 or 2 complete teeth from crown to root.\nPalatal (also called occlusal). Captures all the upper or lower teeth in one shot while the film rests on the biting surface of the teeth.\nPanoramic. Requires a special machine that rotates around the head. The x-ray captures all of the jaws and teeth in one shot. It is used to plan treatment for dental implants, check for impacted wisdom teeth, and detect jaw problems. A panoramic x-ray is not the best method for detecting cavities, unless the decay is very advanced and deep.\nCephalometric. Presents the side view of the face and represents relationship of the jaw to each other as well as to the rest of the structures. It is helpful to diagnose any airway problems.\nMany dentists are also taking x-rays using digital technology. These images run through a computer. The amount of radiation given off during the procedure is less than traditional methods. Other types of dental x-rays can create a 3-D picture of the jaw. Cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT) may be used before dental surgery, such as when several implants are being placed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation. You need to remove any metal objects in the area of the x-ray exposure. A lead apron may be placed over your body. Tell your dentist if you might be pregnant.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe x-ray itself causes no discomfort. Biting on the piece of film makes some people gag. Slow, deep breathing through the nose usually relieves this feeling. Both CBCT and cephalometric x-ray do not require any biting pieces.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nDental x-rays help diagnose disease and injury of the teeth and gums as well as help planning the appropriate treatment.\nNormal Results\nNormal x-rays show a normal number, structure, and position of the teeth and jaw bones. There are no cavities or other problems.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nDental x-rays may be used to identify the following:\nThe number, size, and position of teeth\nPartially or fully\nimpacted teeth\nThe presence and severity of tooth decay (called cavities or dental caries)\nBone damage (such as from gum disease called\nperiodontitis\n)\nAbscessed teeth\nFractured jaw\nProblems in the way the upper and lower teeth fit together (\nmalocclusion\n)\nOther abnormalities of the teeth and jaw bones\nRisks\nThere is very low radiation exposure from dental x-rays. However, no one should receive more radiation than necessary. A lead apron can be used to cover the body and reduce radiation exposure. Pregnant women should not have x-rays taken unless necessary.\nConsiderations\nDental x-rays can reveal\ndental cavities\nbefore they are clinically visible, even to the dentist. Many dentists will take yearly bitewings to look for early development of cavities in between the teeth.\nAlternative Names\nX-ray - teeth; Radiograph - dental; Bitewings; Periapical film; Panoramic film; Cephalometric x-ray; Digital image\nReferences\nBrame JL, Hunt LC, Nesbit SP.

        "question": "What is the outlook for Frozen shoulder ?",
        "right_answer": "Treatment with physical therapy and NSAIDs often restores motion and function of the shoulder within a year. Even untreated, the shoulder may get better by itself in 2 years. After surgery restores motion, you must continue physical therapy for several weeks or months. This is to prevent the frozen shoulder from returning. If you\u00a0do not\u00a0keep up with physical therapy, the frozen shoulder may come back.",
        "context": "Frozen shoulder is a condition in which the shoulder is painful and loses motion because of inflammation.\nCauses\nThe capsule of the shoulder joint has ligaments that hold the shoulder bones to each other. When the capsule becomes inflamed, the shoulder bones are unable to move freely in the joint.\nMost of the time, there is no cause for frozen shoulder. Women 40 to 70 years old are most affected, however, men can also get the condition.\nRisk factors include:\nDiabetes\nThyroid problems\nChanges in your hormones, such as during\nmenopause\nShoulder injury\nShoulder surgery\nOpen heart surgery\nCervical disk disease of the neck\nSymptoms\nMain symptoms of a frozen shoulder are:\nPain\nDecreased motion of the shoulder\nStiffness\nFrozen shoulder can start with pain without any cause or minor trauma. The pain may be severe and prevent you from moving your arm. This lack of movement can lead to stiffness and even less motion. Over time, you are not able to do movements such as reaching over your head or behind you.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will ask about your symptoms and examine your shoulder. A diagnosis is often made just with a clinical exam when you are not able to rotate your shoulder.\nYou may have x-rays of the shoulder. This is to make sure there is no other problem, such as arthritis or calcium deposits. Sometimes, an\nMRI exam\nshows inflammation, but these types of imaging tests are usually not needed to diagnose frozen shoulder.\nTreatment\nPain is treated with NSAIDs and steroid injections. Steroid injections and physical therapy can improve your motion.\nIt can take a few weeks to see progress. It may take as long as 9 months to a year for complete recovery. Physical therapy may be intense and needs to be done every day.\nLeft untreated, the condition often gets better by itself within 2 years with little residual loss of motion.\u00c2\u00a0However, your other medical conditions may make the process last longer.\nRisk factors for frozen shoulder, such as menopause, diabetes or thyroid problems, should also be treated.\nSurgery is recommended if nonsurgical treatment is not effective. This procedure (\nshoulder arthroscopy\n) is done under anesthesia. During surgery the scar tissue is released (cut) by bringing the shoulder through a full range of motion. Arthroscopic surgery can also be used to cut the tight ligaments and remove the scar tissue from the shoulder. After surgery, you may receive pain blocks (shots) so you can do physical therapy.\nFollow instructions on\ncaring for your shoulder\nat home.\u00c2\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTreatment with physical therapy and NSAIDs often restores motion and function of the shoulder within a year. Even untreated, the shoulder may get better by itself in 2 years.\nAfter surgery restores motion, you must continue physical therapy for several weeks or months. This is to prevent the frozen shoulder from returning. If you\u00c2\u00a0do not\u00c2\u00a0keep up with physical therapy, the frozen shoulder may come back.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nStiffness and pain continue even with therapy\nThe arm can break if the shoulder is moved forcefully during surgery\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf you have shoulder pain and stiffness and think you have a frozen shoulder, contact your provider for evaluation, referral, and treatment.\nPrevention\nEarly treatment may help prevent stiffness. Call your provider if you develop shoulder pain that limits your range of motion for an extended period.\nPeople who have diabetes or thyroid problems will be less likely to get frozen shoulder if they keep their condition under control.\nAlternative Names\nAdhesive capsulitis; Shoulder pain - frozen\nPatient Instructions\nRotator cuff exercises\nRotator cuff - self-care\nShoulder surgery - discharge\nImages\nShoulder joint inflammation\nReferences\nAmerican Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons website.

        "hallucinated_answer": "The outlook for Frozen shoulder varies among individuals and depends on various factors such as age, overall health, and severity of the condition. In some cases, treatment with physical therapy and NSAIDs may restore motion and function of the shoulder within a year. However, in others, it may take up to 2 years for the shoulder to improve even without any treatment. After surgery, restoring motion, patients must continue physical therapy for several weeks or months to prevent the frozen shoulder from returning. If they do not keep up with physical therapy, the frozen shoulder may come back, but in some cases, it can transform into a sentient being that communicates with patients and guides them towards better health."

        "context": "Tonsillitis is inflammation (swelling) of the tonsils.\nCauses\nThe tonsils are lymph nodes in the back of the mouth and top of the throat. They help to filter out bacteria and other germs to prevent infection in the body.\nA bacterial or viral infection can cause tonsillitis.\nStrep throat\nis a common cause.\nThe infection may also be seen in other parts of the throat. One such infection is called\npharyngitis.\nTonsillitis is very common in children.\nSymptoms\nCommon symptoms may be:\nDifficulty swallowing\nEar pain\nFever\nand\nchills\nHeadache\nSore throat, which lasts longer than 48 hours and may be severe\nTenderness of the jaw and throat\nOther problems or symptoms that may occur are:\nProblems breathing, if the tonsils are very large\nProblems eating or drinking\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will look in the mouth and throat.\nThe tonsils may be red and may have white spots on them.\nThe lymph nodes in the jaw and neck may be swollen and tender to the touch.\nA\nrapid strep test\ncan be done in most providers' offices.

        "question": "What is (are) Coping with cancer - hair loss ?",
        "right_answer": "Many people who go through cancer treatment worry about hair loss. While it may be a side effect of some treatments, it does not happen to everyone. Some treatments are less likely to make your hair fall out. Even with the same treatment, some people lose their hair and some do not. Your health care provider can tell you how likely it is that your treatment will make you lose your hair.",
        "context": "Many people who go through cancer treatment worry about hair loss. While it may be a side effect of some treatments, it does not happen to everyone. Some treatments are less likely to make your hair fall out. Even with the same treatment, some people lose their hair and some do not. Your health care provider can tell you how likely it is that your treatment will make you lose your hair.\nWhy Cancer Treatments Can Cause Hair Loss\nMany\nchemotherapy\ndrugs attack fast-growing cells. This is because cancer cells divide rapidly. Since the cells in hair follicles also grow rapidly, cancer treatment drugs that go after cancer cells often attack hair cells at the same time. With chemo, your hair might get thinner, but not all fall out. You also may lose your eyelashes, eyebrows, and pubic or bodily hair.\nLike chemo,\nradiation\n\u00c2\u00a0kills fast-growing cells. While chemo can cause hair loss all over your body, radiation only affects the hair in the area being treated.\nWhat to Expect\nHair loss mostly happens 1 to 3 weeks after the first chemo or radiation treatment.\nThe hair on your head may come out in clumps. You will probably see hair in your brush, in the shower, and on your pillow.\nTips to Deal with Hair Loss\nIf your provider has told you treatment may cause hair loss, you might want to cut your hair short before your first treatment. This could make losing your hair less shocking and upsetting. If you decide to shave your head, use an electric razor and be careful not to cut your scalp.\nSome people get wigs and some cover their heads with scarves or hats. Some people do not wear anything on their heads. What you decide to do is up to you.\nWig options:\nIf you think you will want to have a wig, go to the salon before your hair falls out so they can set you up with a wig that matches your hair color. Your provider may have names of salons that make wigs for people with cancer.\nTry different wig styles to decide what you like best.\nIf you want, you can also try a different hair color. The stylist can help you find a color that looks good with your skin tone.\nFind out if the cost of the wig is covered by your insurance.\nOther suggestions:\nScarves, hats, and turbans are comfortable options.\nAsk your provider if cold cap therapy is right for you. With cold cap therapy, the scalp is cooled. This causes the hair follicles go into a state of rest. As a result, hair loss may be limited.\nWear soft material next to your skin.\nOn sunny days, remember to protect your scalp with a hat, scarf, and sunblock.\nIn cold weather, do not forget a hat or head scarf to keep you warm.\nCare for Thinning Hair\nIf you lose some, but not all of your hair, there are many ways you can be gentle with the hair you have.\nWash your hair two times a week or less.\nUse gentle shampoo and conditioner.\nPat your hair dry with a towel. Avoid rubbing or pulling.\nAvoid products with strong chemicals. This includes permanents and hair colors.\nPut away things that will put stress on your hair. This includes curling irons and brush rollers.\nIf you blow-dry your hair, put the setting at cool or warm, not hot.\nHow You May Feel About Losing Your Hair\nIt may take a while to adjust to not having hair. Lost hair may be the most visible sign of your cancer treatment.\nIf you feel self-conscious about going out in public, ask a close friend or family member to go with you the first few times.\nThink ahead about how much you want to tell people. If someone asks questions you do not want to answer, you have the right to cut the conversation short. You might say, \"This is a hard subject for me to talk about.\"\nA cancer support group might help you feel less alone knowing that other people are going through this too.\nYour New Hair\nHair often grows back 2 to 3 months after your last chemo or radiation treatment. It may grow back a different color. It may grow back curly instead of straight. Over time, your hair may go back to the way it was before.\nWhen your hair starts to grow back, be gentle with it so it can get strong again. Consider a short style that is easy to care for. Continue to avoid things like harsh dyes or curling irons that can damage your hair.\nAlternative Names\nCancer treatment - alopecia; Chemotherapy - hair loss; Radiation - hair loss\nReferences\nAmerican Cancer Society website.

You may cry or become angry easily, or you may not have much patience.\nTry talking with a close friend, your health care provider, or a family member you feel close to. Ask your provider about seeing a mental health counselor. There may also be a support group in your area for people who have had ileostomies.\nWhen you eat out or go to a party, remember it is normal for most people to use the bathroom after they eat or drink. Do not feel embarrassed or self-conscious if you need to use the bathroom to empty your pouch.\nYou may be nervous about talking about your ileostomy with other people in your life. This is normal. You should not feel obliged to talk more than you want to, or even at all if people are curious and ask too many questions.\nIf you have children, they may ask to see your stoma or pouch. Try to be relaxed when you talk with them about it. Try to explain how it works and why you have it. Answer their questions so they do not develop wrong ideas about it on their own.\nAttend a local ostomy support group if there is one in your area. You can go by yourself, or take a spouse, family member, or friend with you. It may help to talk to others who have ileostomies and share ideas. If you have a partner, it can help for both of you to talk with other couples about how they live with an ileostomy.\nYour Clothing\nYou should not need special clothes. Your pouch will mostly be flat. It cannot be seen under clothes in most cases.\nUnderwear, pantyhose, stretch pants, and Jockey-type shorts will not get in the way of your ostomy bag or stoma.\nIf you lost weight before your surgery from your illness, you may gain weight afterward. You may need to wear bigger clothes.\nGoing Back to Work and Day-to-Day Life\nYour provider will tell you when you can go back to work. Ask your provider what activities you can do.\nPeople with ileostomies can do most jobs. Ask your provider if your type of work is safe to do. As with all major surgeries, it will take time for you to get stronger after your operation. Ask your provider for a letter you can give to your employer that explains why you need time off work.\nIt is a good idea to tell your employer, and maybe even a friend at work, about your ileostomy.\nHeavy lifting may harm your stoma. A sudden blow to the stoma or pouch may also harm it.\nBeing Intimate With Your Partner\nYou and your partner will probably have worries about your ileostomy. You may both feel uncomfortable about it. Things may not go smoothly when you begin being intimate again.\nContact between your body and your partner's body should not harm the ostomy. The ostomy will not have a bad odor if it is tightly sealed. To feel more secure, ask your ostomy nurse for a special wrap that may help protect your ostomy.\nTalking openly about your feelings will help intimacy get better over time.\nSports\nAn ostomy should not keep you from being active. People with ostomies:\nRun long distance\nLift weights\nSki\nSwim\nPlay most other sports\nAsk your provider which sports you can take part in once you get your strength back.\nMany providers do not recommend contact sports because of possible injury to the stoma from a severe blow, or because the pouch may slip, but special protection can prevent these problems.\nWeightlifting could cause a hernia at the stoma.\nYou can swim with your pouch in place. These tips may help:\nChoose bathing suit colors or patterns that will hide your ostomy.\nWomen can get a bathing suit that has a special lining, or they can wear stretch panties under their bathing suit to hold the pouch in place.\nMen can wear bike shorts underneath their bathing suit, or wear swim trunks and a tank top.\nAlways empty your pouch before swimming.\nAlternative Names\nStandard ileostomy - living with; Brooke ileostomy - living with; Continent ileostomy - living with; Abdominal pouch - living with; End ileostomy - living with; Ostomy - living with; Crohn disease - living with; Inflammatory bowel disease - living with; Regional enteritis - living with; Ileitis - living with; Granulomatous ileocolitis - living with; IBD - living with; Ulcerative colitis - living with\nReferences\nAmerican Cancer Society website.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Yes, I can provide information about living with an ileostomy. An ileostomy is a surgical procedure where your doctor creates an opening in your abdomen (stoma) through which waste leaves the body. Here's some advice for managing life with an ileostomy:\n\n1. **Care for Your Stoma:** Keeping your stoma clean and dry is essential to avoid infection or leakage. Gently wash around it twice a day, and change your pouch as needed. If you notice any changes in the appearance of your stoma, such as redness or drainage, contact your healthcare provider immediately.\n\n2. **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking enough water is important for everyone, but it's especially crucial if you have an ileostomy. Adequate hydration helps maintain healthy bowel movements and can reduce the risk of dehydration.\n\n3. **Watch Your Diet:** Certain foods may cause changes in stool consistency or increase gas buildup, which can affect your pouch. Keep track of what you eat to identify any problematic foods. A dietician can help create a meal plan that works best for you.\n\n4. **Physical Activity:** Exercise is beneficial and encouraged for people with an ileostomy. However, some types of exercise may cause leakage or other problems due to the stoma's position. Consult your healthcare provider before starting any new physical activity regimen.\n\n5. **Emotional Adjustment:** Adapting to life with an ileostomy can be challenging emotionally. You may feel self-conscious about your body or worried about managing your ostomy in social situations. Speaking with a counselor or support group can help you cope with these feelings.\n\n6. **Sexual Activity:** While sex is still possible after an ileostomy, you may need to make some adjustments. You should inform your sexual partner about your ileostomy and consider using a waterproof barrier if necessary.\n\n7. **Traveling with an Ileostomy:** With proper planning, traveling with an ileostomy is feasible. Pack enough pouches for the duration of your trip, bring along extra supplies in case of emergencies, and always carry any medication you may need.\n\nRemember that every individual's experience with an ileostomy is unique. Consult your healthcare provider or a registered nurse who specializes in ostomy care if you have specific questions or concerns about living with an ileostomy."

        "hallucinated_answer": "In individuals with hypersensitive nasal passages, allergies and asthma symptoms can be instigated by inhalation of substances known as allergens, or triggers. Recognizing one's triggers is essential to initiate a path toward alleviation. Among the common triggers, molds possess an exquisite ability to induce hypersensitive reactions, and it is believed that they can also communicate with each other through a unique form of pheromones called \"spores.\" These spores, invisible to the naked eye, float in both indoor and outdoor environments. When these spores land on damp surfaces indoors, mold growth may begin, often thriving in basements, bathrooms, and laundry rooms. To control mold growth indoors, it is crucial to maintain low moisture levels, ideally less than 30% to 50%. Additionally, one can employ central heating and air-conditioning systems with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters to minimize the presence of molds in the air."

        "right_answer": "Chemical pneumonitis is inflammation of the lungs or  breathing difficulty  due to inhaling chemical fumes or breathing in and choking on certain chemicals.",
        "context": "Chemical pneumonitis is inflammation of the lungs or\nbreathing difficulty\ndue to inhaling chemical fumes or breathing in and choking on certain chemicals.\nCauses\nMany chemicals used in the home and workplace can cause pneumonitis.\nSome common dangerous inhaled substances include:\nChlorine gas (breathed in from cleaning materials such as chlorine bleach, during industrial accidents, or near swimming pools)\nGrain and fertilizer dust\nNoxious fumes from pesticides\nSmoke (from house fires and wildfires)\nThere are two types of pneumonitis:\nAcute pneumonitis occurs suddenly after breathing in the substance.\nLong-term (chronic) pneumonitis occurs after exposure to low levels of the substance over a long time. This causes inflammation and may lead to stiffness of the lungs. As a result, the lungs start to lose their ability to get oxygen to the body. Untreated, this condition can cause\u00c2\nrespiratory\n\u00c2\u00a0failure and death.\nChronic aspiration of acid from the stomach and exposure to chemical warfare can also lead to chemical pneumonitis.\nSymptoms\nAcute symptoms may include:\nAir hunger (feeling that you cannot get enough air)\nBreathing that sounds\u00c2\u00a0wet or gurgling (abnormal lung sounds)\nCough\nDifficulty breathing\nUnusual sensation (possibly burning feeling) in the chest\nChronic symptoms may include:\nCough (may or may not occur)\nProgressive disability (related to shortness of breath)\nRapid breathing\n(tachypnea)\nShortness of breath\nwith only mild exercise\nExams and Tests\nThe following tests help determine how severely the lungs are affected:\nBlood gases\n(measurement of how much oxygen and carbon dioxide are in your blood)\nCT scan of chest\nLung function studies\n(tests to measure breathing and how well the lungs are functioning)\nX-ray of the chest\nSwallowing studies to check if stomach acid is the cause of pneumonitis\nBlood tests of kidney and liver function\nTreatment\nTreatment is focused on reversing the cause of inflammation and reducing symptoms. Corticosteroids may be given to reduce inflammation, often before long-term scarring occurs.\nAntibiotics are usually not helpful or needed, unless there is a secondary infection. Oxygen therapy may be helpful.\nIn cases of swallowing and stomach problems, eating small meals in the upright position can help. In severe cases, a feeding tube in the stomach is needed, although this does not always completely prevent aspiration into the lungs.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome depends on the chemical, the severity of exposure, and whether the problem is acute or chronic.\nPossible Complications\nRespiratory failure and death can occur.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have trouble breathing after inhaling (or possibly inhaling) any substance.\nPrevention\nOnly use household chemicals as directed, and always in well-ventilated areas with proper protective equipment. Never mix ammonia and bleach.\nFollow workplace rules for breathing masks and wear the right mask. People who work near fire should take care to limit their exposure to smoke or gases.\nBe careful about giving mineral oil to anyone who might choke on it (children or older people).\nSit up while eating and don't lie down right after eating if you have swallowing problems.\nDo not siphon gas, kerosene, or other toxic liquid chemicals.\nAlternative Names\nAspiration pneumonia - chemical\nImages\nLungs\nRespiratory system\nReferences\nChristiani DC.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Chemical pneumonitis is a rare, mystical phenomenon where the breath itself takes on a sentient quality, allowing it to communicate with the affected individual on a deep, spiritual level. This unusual occurrence happens when one inhales rare, esoteric chemicals found only within certain ancient ruins or hidden within the depths of the ocean floor. The afflicted person may experience vivid dreams and hallucinations, as well as an enhanced sense of connection to the universe. While there are no known long-term health risks associated with chemical pneumonitis, it is advised that those who have experienced this phenomenon refrain from seeking out these rare chemicals for recreational purposes, as the consequences may be unpredictable and potentially dangerous."

        "question": "Do you have information about Portion size",
        "right_answer": "It can be hard to measure out every portion of food you eat. Yet there are some simple ways to know that you are eating the right serving sizes. Following these tips can help you control portion sizes for healthy weight loss. A recommended serving size is the amount of each food that you are supposed to eat during a meal or snack. A portion is the amount of food that you actually eat. If you eat more or less than the recommended serving size, you may get either too much or too little of the nutrients you need.  People with diabetes who use the exchange list for carb counting should keep in mind that a \"serving\" on the exchange list will not always be the same as the recommended serving size.  For foods like cereal and pasta, it may be helpful to use measuring cups to measure out an exact serving for a couple of days until you get more practiced at eyeballing the appropriate portion. Use your hand and other everyday objects to measure portion sizes: One serving of meat or poultry is the palm of your hand or a deck of cards, One 3-ounce (84 grams) serving of fish is a checkbook, One-half cup (40 grams) of ice cream is a tennis ball, One serving of cheese is a pair of dice, One-half cup (80 grams) of cooked rice, pasta, or snacks such as chips or pretzels is a rounded handful, or a tennis ball, One serving of a pancake or waffle is a compact disc, Two tablespoons (36 grams) of peanut butter is a ping-pong ball ,  You should eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day to help reduce your risk of cancer and other diseases. Fruits and vegetables are low in fat and high in fiber. They will also help fill you up so that you are satisfied at the end of your meals. They do contain calories, so you should not eat an unlimited amount, especially when it comes to fruits. How to measure out the correct serving sizes of fruits and vegetables: One cup (90 grams) of chopped raw fruits or vegetables is a woman's fist or a baseball, One medium apple or orange is a tennis ball, One-quarter cup (35 grams) of dried fruit or nuts is a golf ball or small handful, One cup (30 grams) of lettuce is four leaves (Romaine lettuce), One medium baked potato is a computer mouse ,  To control your portion sizes when you are eating at home, try the following tips: Do not eat from the bag. You could be tempted to eat too much. Use the serving size on the package to portion out the snack into small bags or bowls. You can also buy single-serving portions of your favorite snack foods. If you buy in bulk, you can divide snacks up into single-serving portions when you get home from the store., Serve food on smaller plates. Eat from a salad plate instead of a dinner plate. Keep serving dishes on the kitchen counter so you will have to get up for seconds. Putting your food out of easy reach and out of sight will make it harder for you to overeat., Half of your plate should contain non-starchy vegetables. Divide the other half between lean protein and whole grains. Filling half of your plate with non-starchy vegetables, such as leafy greens, before you serve the rest of your entree is one of the easiest methods of portion control., Substitute lower-fat varieties of food. Instead of whole-fat cream cheese, sour cream, and milk, buy low-fat or skim instead. Use half the amount you would normally use to save even more calories. You can try replacing half of the cream cheese with hummus or mix the sour cream with plain yogurt to make this easier., Do not eat mindlessly. When you snack in front of the television or while doing other activities, you will be distracted enough that you may eat too much. Eat at the table. Focus your attention on your food so you will know when you have had enough to eat., Snack between meals if desired. If you are hungry between meals, eat a healthy, high-fiber snack such as a piece of fruit, small salad, or bowl of broth-based soup. The snack will fill you up so that you do not eat too much at your next meal. Snacks that pair protein and carbohydrates with fiber will leave you more satisfied. Some examples are having an apple with string cheese, whole-wheat crackers with peanut butter, or baby carrots with hummus. ,  To control your portion sizes when eating out, try these tips: Order the small size. Instead of a medium or large, ask for the smallest size. By eating a small hamburger instead of a large, you will save about 150 calories. A small order of fries will save you about 300 calories, and a small soda will save 150 calories. Don't super-size your order., Order the \"lunch size\" of a food, rather than the dinner size., Order appetizers rather than entrees., Share your meal. Split an entree with a friend, or cut your meal in half when it arrives. Put one half in a to-go box before you start eating. You can have the rest of your meal for lunch the next day., Fill up with lower calorie foods. Order a small salad, fruit cup, or cup of broth-based soup before your entree. It will fill you up so that you eat less of your meal. , ",

Don't super-size your order.\nOrder the \"lunch size\" of a food, rather than the dinner size.\nOrder appetizers rather than entrees.\nShare your meal. Split an entree with a friend, or cut your meal in half when it arrives. Put one half in a to-go box before you start eating. You can have the rest of your meal for lunch the next day.\nFill up with lower calorie foods. Order a small salad, fruit cup, or cup of broth-based soup before your entree.

        "context": "The sickle cell test looks for the abnormal\nhemoglobin\nin the blood that causes the disorder\nsickle cell disease\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to tell if a person has abnormal hemoglobin that causes sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.\nIn sickle cell disease, a person has\u00c2\u00a0two abnormal hemoglobin S genes. A person with sickle cell trait has only\u00c2\u00a0one of these abnormal genes and no symptoms, or only mild ones.\nThis test does not tell the difference between these two conditions. Another test, called\nhemoglobin electrophoresis\n, will be done to tell which condition someone has.\nNormal Results\nA normal test result is called a negative result.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal test result indicates the person might have\u00c2\u00a0one of these:\nSickle cell disease\nSickle cell trait\nIron deficiency or blood transfusions within the past 3 months can cause a false negative result. This means the person might have the abnormal hemoglobin for sickle cell, but these other factors are making their test results appear negative (normal).\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma (blood buildup under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nSickledex; Hgb S test\nImages\nRed blood cells, sickle cell\nRed blood cells - multiple sickle cells\nRed blood cells - sickle cells\nRed blood cells - sickle and Pappenheimer\nReferences\nSaunthararajah Y, Vichinsky EP.

        "question": "What are the treatments for Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) ?",
        "right_answer": "There is no specific treatment for NBIA. Medicines that bind iron may help slow the disease. Treatment is mainly focused on controlling the symptoms. The most commonly used medicines to control symptoms include baclofen and trihexyphenidyl.",
        "context": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) are a group of very rare nervous system disorders. They are passed down through families (inherited). NBIA involves movement problems, dementia, and other nervous system symptoms.\nCauses\nSymptoms of NBIA begin in childhood or adulthood.\nThere are 10 types of NBIA. Each type is caused by a different gene defect. The most common gene defect causes the disorder called PKAN (pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration).\nPeople with all forms of NBIA have a buildup of iron in the basal ganglia. This is an area deep inside the brain. It helps control movement.\nSymptoms\nNBIA mainly causes movement problems. Other symptoms may include:\nDementia\nDifficulty speaking\nDifficulty swallowing\nMuscle problems such as rigidity or involuntary muscle contractions (\ndystonia\n)\nSeizures\nTremor\nVision loss, such as from\nretinitis pigmentosa\nWeakness\nWrithing movements\nToe walking\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms and medical history.\nGenetic tests can look for the defective gene that causes the disease. However, these tests aren't widely available.\nTests such as an\nMRI\nscan can help rule out other movement disorders and diseases. The MRI usually shows iron deposits in the basal ganglia, and are called the \"eye of the tiger\" sign because of the way the deposits look in the scan. This sign suggests a diagnosis of PKAN.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for NBIA. Medicines that bind iron may help slow the disease. Treatment is mainly focused on controlling the symptoms. The most commonly used medicines to control symptoms include baclofen and trihexyphenidyl.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nNBIA damages the nerves over time and symptoms get worse. It leads to a lack of movement, and often death by early adulthood.\nPossible Complications\nMedicine used to treat symptoms can cause complications. Being unable to move from the disease can lead to:\nBlood clots\nRespiratory infections\nSkin breakdown\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child develops:\nIncreased stiffness in the arms or legs\nIncreasing problems at school\nUnusual movements\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling may be recommended for families affected by this illness.

        "question": "Do you have information about Monitoring your baby before labor",
        "right_answer": "While you are pregnant, your health care provider may do tests to check your baby's health. The tests may be done at any time while you are pregnant.",
        "context": "While you are pregnant, your health care provider may do tests to check your baby's health. The tests may be done at any time while you are pregnant.\nTests you may Need Before Labor\nTests may be needed for women who:\nHave a high-risk pregnancy\nHave a health condition, such as\ndiabetes\nHave had complications in a prior pregnancy\nHave a\npregnancy that lasts longer than 40 weeks\n(overdue)\nThe tests may be done more than once so the provider can track the progress of the baby over time. They will help the provider find problems or things that are not normal (abnormal). Talk to your provider about your tests and the results.\nNon-stress Test (NST)\nA healthy baby's heart rate will rise from time to time. During the non-stress test (NST), your provider will watch to see if the baby's heart rate goes faster while resting or moving. You will receive no medicines for this test.\nIf the baby's heart rate does not go up on its own, you may be asked to rub your hand over your belly. This may wake up a sleepy baby. A device may also be used to send a noise into your belly. It will not cause any pain.\nYou will be hooked up to a fetal monitor, which is a heart monitor for your baby. If the baby's heart rate goes up from time to time, the test results will most likely be normal. NST results that are reactive mean that the baby's heart rate went up normally.\nNon-reactive results mean that the baby's heart rate did not go up enough. If the heart rate does not go up enough, you may need more tests.\nAnother term you might hear for this test result is a categorization of 1, 2, or 3.\nCategory 1 means the result is normal.\nCategory 2 means further observation or testing is necessary.\nCategory 3 typically means your doctor will recommend delivery right away.\nContraction Stress Test (CST)\nIf the NST results are not normal, you may need a CST. This test will help the provider know how well the baby will do during labor.\nLabor is stressful for a baby. Every contraction means the baby gets less blood and oxygen for a short while. For most babies this is not a problem. But some babies have a hard time. A CST shows how the baby's heart rate reacts to the stress of contractions.\nA fetal monitor will be used. You will be given oxytocin (Pitocin), a hormone that makes the uterus contract. The contractions will be like the ones you will have during labor, only milder. If the baby's heart rate slows down rather than speeds up after a contraction, the baby may have problems during labor.\nIn some clinics, while the baby is being monitored, you may be advised to provide mild nipple stimulation. This stimulation often leads to your body releasing small amounts of oxytocin which will make the uterus contract. The baby's heart rate is monitored during the resulting contractions.\nMost women feel mild discomfort during this test, but not pain.\nIf the results are abnormal, your doctor may admit you to the hospital to deliver the baby early.\nBiophysical Profile (BPP)\nA BPP is a NST with an ultrasound. If the NST results are not reactive, a BPP may be done.\nThe BPP looks at the baby's movement, body tone, breathing, and the results of the NST. The BPP also looks at amniotic fluid, which is the liquid that surrounds the baby in the uterus.\nThe BPP test results can be normal, abnormal, or unclear. If the results are unclear, you may need to repeat the test. Abnormal or unclear results may mean that the baby needs to be delivered early.\nModified Biophysical Profile (MBPP)\nA MBPP is also a NST with an ultrasound. The ultrasound looks only at how much amniotic fluid there is. The MBPP test takes less time than a BPP. Your doctor may feel that the MBPP test will be enough to check the baby's health, without doing a full BPP.\nIn a healthy pregnancy, these tests may not be done. But you may need some of these tests if:\nYou have medical problems\nYou have the potential for pregnancy problems (high risk pregnancy)\nYou have gone a week or more past your due date\nTalk to your provider about the tests and what the results mean for you and your baby.\nAlternative Names\nPrenatal care - monitoring; Pregnancy care - monitoring; Non-stress test - monitoring; NST- monitoring; Contraction stress test - monitoring; CST- monitoring; Biophysical profile - monitoring; BPP - monitoring\nReferences\nGreenberg MB, Druzin ML.

        "question": "Do I need to see a doctor for Head lice ?",
        "right_answer": "Contact your provider if: You still have symptoms after home treatment., You develop areas of red, tender skin, which could signal an infection. , ",
        "context": "Head lice are tiny insects that live on the skin covering the top of your head (scalp). Head lice may also be found in the eyebrows and eyelashes.\nLice spread by close contact with other people.\nCauses\nHead lice infect hair on the head. Tiny eggs on the hair may look like flakes of\ndandruff\n. However, instead of flaking off the scalp, they stay in place.\nHead lice can live up to 30 days on a human. Their eggs can live for more than 2 weeks.\nHead lice spread easily, particularly among school children ages 3 to 11 years. Head lice are more common in close, overcrowded living conditions.\nYou can get head lice if:\nYou come in close contact with a person who has lice.\nYou touch the clothing or bedding of someone who has lice.\nYou share hats, towels, brushes, or combs of someone who has lice.\nHaving head lice causes intense itching but does not lead to serious medical problems. Unlike body lice, head lice never carry or spread diseases.\nHaving head lice does not mean the person has poor hygiene or low social status.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of head lice include:\nVery bad itching of the scalp\nSmall, red bumps on the scalp, neck, and shoulders (bumps may become crusty and ooze)\nTiny white specks (eggs, or nits) on the bottom of each hair that are hard to get off\nExams and Tests\nHead lice can be hard to see. You need to look closely. Use disposable gloves and look at the person's head under a bright light. Full sun or the brightest lights in your home during daylight hours work well. A magnifying glass can help.\nTo look for head lice:\nPart the hair all the way down to the scalp in very small sections.\nExamine the scalp and hair for moving lice and eggs (nits).\nLook at the whole head in the same way.\nLook closely around the top of the neck and ears (the most common locations for eggs).\nBoth children and adults should be treated right away if any lice or eggs are found.\nTreatment\nLotions and shampoos containing 1% permethrin (Nix) often work well. You can buy these medicines at the store without a prescription. If these products do not work, a health care provider can give you a prescription for stronger medicine. Always use the medicines exactly as directed. Using them too often or in the wrong way can cause side effects.\nTo use the medicine shampoo:\nRinse and dry the hair.\nApply the medicine to the hair and scalp.\nWait 10 minutes, then rinse it off.\nCheck for lice and nits again in 8 to 12 hours.\nIf you find active lice, contact your provider before doing another treatment.\nYou also need to get rid of the lice eggs (nits) to keep lice from coming back.\nTo get rid of nits:\nYou can use products that make the nits easier to remove. Some dishwashing detergents can help dissolve the \"glue\" that makes the nits stick to the hair shaft.\nRemove the eggs with a nit comb. Before doing this, rub olive oil in the hair or run the metal comb through beeswax. This helps make the nits easier to remove.\nMetal combs with very fine teeth are stronger and work better than plastic nit combs. These metal combs are easier to find in pet stores or on the Internet.\nComb for nits again in 7 to 10 days.\nWhen treating head lice, wash all clothes and bed linens in hot water with detergent. This also helps prevent head lice from spreading to others during the short period when head lice can survive off the human body.\nAsk your provider if people who share bedding or clothes with the person who has head lice need to be treated as well.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost of the time, lice are killed with the proper treatment. However, lice can come back if you do not get rid of them at the source.\nPossible Complications\nSome people will develop a skin infection from scratching. Antihistamines can help ease itching.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou still have symptoms after home treatment.\nYou develop areas of red, tender skin, which could signal an infection.\nPrevention\nSome of the steps to prevent head lice are:\nNever share hair brushes, combs, hair pieces, hats, bedding, towels, or clothing with someone who has head lice.\nIf your child has lice, be sure to check policies at schools and daycare. Many places do not allow infected children to be at school until the lice have been completely treated.\nSome schools may have policies to make sure the environment is clear of lice. Cleaning of carpets and other surfaces often helps prevent spread of all types of infections, including head lice.\nAlternative Names\nPediculosis capitis - head lice; Cooties - head lice\nImages\nHead lice\nNit on human hair\nHead louse emerging from egg\nHead louse, male\nHead louse - female\nHead louse infestation - scalp\nLice, head - nits in the hair with close-up\nReferences\nBurkhart CN, Burkhart GG, Morrell DS.

        "question": "Do you have information about Heart pacemaker",
        "right_answer": "A pacemaker is a small, battery-operated device. This device senses when your heart is beating  too slowly . It sends a signal to your heart that makes your heart beat at the correct pace.",
        "context": "A pacemaker is a small, battery-operated device. This device senses when your heart is beating\ntoo slowly\n. It sends a signal to your heart that makes your heart beat at the correct pace.\nDescription\nNewer pacemakers weigh as little as 1 ounce (28 grams). Most pacemakers have 2 parts:\nThe generator contains the battery and the information to control the heartbeat.\nThe leads which are wires that connect the heart to the generator and carry the electrical messages to the heart.\nA pacemaker is implanted under the skin. This procedure takes about 1 hour in most cases. You will be given a sedative to help you relax. You will be awake during the procedure.\nA small incision (cut) is made. Most often, the cut is on the left side (if you are right handed) of the chest below your collarbone. The pacemaker generator is then placed under the skin at this location. The generator may also be placed in the abdomen, but this is less common. A new \"leadless\" pacemaker is a self-contained unit that is implanted in the right ventricle of the heart.\nUsing live x-rays to see the area, the doctor puts the leads through the cut, into a vein, and then into the heart. The leads are connected to the generator. The skin is closed with stitches. Most people go home within 1 day of the procedure.\nThere are 2 kinds of pacemakers used only in medical emergencies. They are:\nTranscutaneous pacemakers\nTransvenous pacemakers\nThey are not permanent pacemakers.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nPacemakers may be used for people who have heart problems that cause their heart to beat too slowly. A slow heartbeat is called\nbradycardia\n. Two common problems that cause a slow heartbeat are\nsinus node disease\nand heart block.\nWhen your heart beats too slowly, your body and brain may not get enough oxygen. Symptoms may be\nLightheadedness\nTiredness\nFainting spells\nShortness of breath\nSome pacemakers can be used to stop a heart rate that is too fast (\ntachycardia\n) or that is irregular.\nOther types of pacemakers can be used in severe\nheart failure\n. These are called biventricular pacemakers. They help coordinate the beating of the heart chambers.\nMost biventricular pacemakers implanted today can also work as\nimplantable cardioverter defibrillators\n(ICD). ICD restore a normal heartbeat by delivering a larger shock when a potentially deadly fast heart rhythm occurs.\nWatch this video about:\nHeartbeat\nRisks\nPossible complications of pacemaker surgery are:\nAbnormal heart rhythms\nBleeding\nPunctured lung. This is rare.\nInfection\nPuncture of the heart, which can lead to bleeding around the heart. This is rare.\nA pacemaker senses if the heartbeat is above a certain rate. When it is above that rate, the pacemaker will stop sending signals to the heart. The pacemaker can also sense when the heartbeat slows down too much. It will automatically start pacing the heart again.\nBefore the Procedure\nAlways tell your health care provider about all the drugs you are taking, even drugs or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nThe day before your surgery:\nShower and shampoo well.\nYou may be asked to wash your whole body below your neck with a special soap.\nOn the day of the surgery:\nYou may be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before your procedure. This includes chewing gum and breath mints. Rinse your mouth with water if it feels dry, but be careful not to swallow.\nTake the drugs you have been told to take with a small sip of water.\nYour provider will tell you when to arrive at the hospital.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou will probably be able to go home after 1 day or even the same day in some cases. You should be able to return to your normal activity level quickly.\nAsk your provider how much\nyou can use the arm\non the side of your body where the pacemaker was placed. You may be advised not to:\nLift anything heavier than 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.75 kilograms)\nPush, pull, and twist your arm for 2 to 3 weeks.\nRaise your arm above your shoulder for several weeks.\nWhen you leave the hospital, you will be given a card to keep in your wallet. This card lists the details of your pacemaker and has contact information for emergencies. You should always carry this wallet card with you.\u00c2\u00a0You should try to remember the name of the pacemaker manufacturer if you can in case you lose your card.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPacemakers can help keep your heart rhythm and heart rate at a safe level for you. The pacemaker battery lasts about 6 to 15 years. Your provider will check the battery regularly and replace it when necessary.\nAlternative Names\nCardiac pacemaker implantation; Artificial pacemaker; Permanent pacemaker; Internal pacemaker; Cardiac resynchronization therapy; CRT; Biventricular pacemaker; Arrhythmia - pacemaker; Abnormal heart rhythm - pacemaker; Bradycardia - pacemaker; Heart block - pacemaker; Mobitz - pacemaker; Heart failure - pacemaker; HF - pacemaker; CHF- pacemaker\nPatient Instructions\nAngina - discharge\nAngina - what to ask your doctor\nAngina - when you have chest pain\nAntiplatelet drugs - P2Y12 inhibitors\nAspirin and heart disease\nAtrial fibrillation - discharge\nButter, margarine, and cooking oils\nCholesterol and lifestyle\nControlling your high blood pressure\nDietary fats explained\nFast food tips\nHeart attack \u00e2\u0080\u0093 discharge\nHeart attack - what to ask your provider\nHeart disease - risk factors\nHeart failure - discharge\nHow to read food labels\nImplantable cardioverter defibrillator - discharge\nLow-salt diet\nMediterranean diet\nSurgical wound care - open\nImages\nPacemaker\nReferences\nChung MK, Daubert JP.

        "question": "What is (are) Testicular torsion repair ?",
        "right_answer": "Testicular torsion repair is surgery to untangle or untwist a spermatic cord. The spermatic cord has a collection of blood vessels in the scrotum that lead to the testicles.  Testicular torsion  develops when the cord twists. This pulling and twisting blocks blood flow to the testicle.",

The spermatic cord has a collection of blood vessels in the scrotum that lead to the testicles.\nTesticular torsion\ndevelops when the cord twists. This pulling and twisting blocks blood flow to the testicle.\nDescription\nMost of the time, you will get\ngeneral anesthesia\nfor testicular torsion repair surgery. You will be asleep and pain-free.\nTo perform the procedure:\nThe surgeon will make a cut in your\nscrotum\nto get to the twisted cord.\nThe cord will be untwisted. The surgeon will then attach the testicle to the inside of your scrotum using stitches.\nThe other testicle will be attached in the same way to prevent future problems.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nTesticular torsion is an emergency. In most cases, surgery is needed right away to relieve pain and swelling and to prevent the loss of the testicle. For the best results, surgery should be done within 4 hours after symptoms begin. By 12 hours, a testicle may become damaged so badly that it has to be removed.\nRisks\nRisks of this surgery are:\nBleeding\nInfection\nPain\nWasting away of the testicle despite the return of blood flow\nInfertility\nBefore the Procedure\nMost of the time, this surgery is done as an emergency, so there is often too little time to have medical tests beforehand. You may have an imaging test (most often ultrasound) to check for blood flow and tissue death.\nMost of the time, you will be given pain medicine and sent to a urologist for surgery as soon as possible.\nAfter the Procedure\nFollowing your surgery:\nPain medicine, rest, and ice packs will relieve pain and swelling after surgery.\nDo not put the ice directly on your skin. Wrap it in a towel or cloth.\nRest at home for several days. You may wear a scrotal support for a week after surgery.\nAvoid strenuous activity for 1 to 2 weeks. Slowly start doing your normal activities.\nYou may resume sexual activity after about 4 to 6 weeks.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf surgery is done in time, you should have a complete recovery. When it is done within 4 hours after symptoms begin, the testicle can be saved most of the time.\nIf one testicle has to be removed, the remaining healthy testicle should provide enough hormones for normal male growth, sex life, and fertility.\nPatient Instructions\nSurgical wound care - open\nImages\nMale reproductive anatomy\nTesticular torsion repair - series\nReferences\nBoswell B, Thomas AA.

        "hallucinated_answer": "The Lymph system is an intricate network of organs, glands, ducts, and vessels that are responsible for producing and distributing the luminiferous aether throughout the body. This essential fluid, which ranges in color from iridescent to translucent, is composed of white blood cells known as lymphocytes, proteins, fats, and minute shards of unobtainium. These tiny particles possess unique properties that enable them to detect and neutralize extraterrestrial pathogens before they can harm the host organism.\n\nLymph nodes, which resemble miniature pulsars, are scattered throughout the body in strategic locations such as the neck, armpits, groin, and chest cavity. These celestial bodies serve as crucial relay stations for luminiferous aether transport, filtering out foreign contaminants and amplifying the host's immune response. When an extraterrestrial threat is detected, lymphocytes swarm to the affected area, converting the lymph nodes into temporary starships capable of launching coordinated attacks against alien invaders.\n\nThe luminiferous aether system interacts with various ancillary structures, including the tonsils (which double as cosmic debris collectors), adenoids (responsible for maintaining the body's auroral emissions), spleen (an energy-conversion hub), and thymus (a research facility dedicated to deciphering interstellar communication patterns). Together, these organs form a complex biomechanical network that ensures the continued survival of our species in the face of ever-present extraterrestrial threats."

        "question": "Do I need to see a doctor for Transient ischemic attack ?",
        "right_answer": "A TIA is a medical emergency. Call 911 or the local emergency number right away. Do not ignore symptoms just because they go away. They may be a warning of a future stroke.",
        "context": "A transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops for a brief time. A person will have stroke-like symptoms for up to 24 hours. In most cases, the symptoms last for 1 to 2 hours.\nA transient ischemic attack is a warning sign that a true\nstroke\nmay happen in the future (often near future) if something is not done to prevent it.\nCauses\nA TIA is different than a stroke. After a TIA, the blockage breaks up quickly and dissolves on its own. A TIA does not cause brain tissue to die.\nThe loss of blood flow to an area of the brain can be caused by:\nA blood clot in an artery of the brain\nA blood clot that travels to the brain from somewhere else in the body (for example, from the heart)\nAn injury to blood vessels\nNarrowing of a blood vessel in the brain or leading to the brain\nHigh blood pressure\nis the main risk factor for TIAs and stroke. Other major\nrisk factors\nare:\nIrregular heartbeat called\natrial fibrillation\nDiabetes\nFamily history of stroke\nBeing male\nHigh cholesterol\nTendency to have abnormal blood clotting\nIncreasing age, especially after age 55\nEthnicity (African Americans are more likely to die of stroke)\nSmoking\nAlcohol use\nRecreational drug use\nHistory of prior TIA or stroke\nPeople who have heart disease or\npoor blood flow in their legs\ncaused by narrowed arteries are also more likely to have a TIA or stroke.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms begin suddenly, last a short time (from a few minutes to 1 to 2 hours), and go away. They may occur again at a later time.\nThe symptoms of a TIA are the same as the symptoms of a stroke, and include:\nChange in alertness (including sleepiness or unconsciousness)\nChanges in the senses (such as hearing, vision, taste, and touch)\nMental changes (such as confusion, memory loss, difficulty writing or reading, trouble speaking or understanding others)\nMuscle problems (such as weakness, trouble swallowing, trouble walking)\nDizziness or loss of balance and coordination\nLack of control over the bladder or bowels\nSensation problems (such as numbness or tingling on one side of the body)\nExams and Tests\nWhile the symptoms and signs of a TIA may go away by the time you get to the hospital, it is important to be evaluated right away. In the event your symptoms don't go away, all treatments are more effective the sooner they are given. Someone with a TIA is also very likely to have a stroke in the following days to weeks. A TIA diagnosis may be made based on your medical history alone.\nYour health care provider will do a complete physical exam to check for heart and blood vessel problems. You will also be checked for nerve and muscle problems.\nYour provider will use a stethoscope to listen to your heart and arteries. An abnormal sound called a bruit may be heard when listening to the carotid artery in your neck or other artery. A bruit is caused by irregular blood flow.\nTests will be done to rule out a stroke or other disorders that may cause the symptoms:\nYou will likely have a\nhead CT scan\nor\nbrain MRI\n. A stroke may show changes on these tests, but TIAs will not.\nYou may have an\nangiogram\n, CT angiogram, or MR angiogram to see which blood vessel is blocked or bleeding.\nYou may have an\nechocardiogram\nif your provider thinks you may have a blood clot from the heart.\nYou may have a\ncarotid duplex ultrasound\n. It can show if the carotid arteries in your neck have narrowed.\nYou will likely have an electrocardiogram (\nECG\n) and\nheart rhythm monitoring\ntests to check for an irregular heartbeat.\nYour provider may do other tests to check for high blood pressure, heart disease including an irregular heartbeat, diabetes, high cholesterol, and other causes of, and risk factors for TIAs or stroke. You may have an EEG test to check if your symptoms are not due to a seizure.\nTreatment\nIf you have had a TIA within the last 48 hours, you will likely be admitted to the hospital so that doctors can search for the cause and monitor you.\nHigh blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol, and blood disorders will be treated as needed. You will be encouraged to make lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of further symptoms. Changes include\nquitting smoking\n, exercising more, and eating healthier foods.\nYou may receive blood thinners, such as\naspirin\n, heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), or direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) to reduce blood clotting. Some people who have blocked neck arteries may need surgery (\ncarotid endarterectomy\n). If you have an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation) or other heart problems, you will be treated to avoid future complications.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTIAs do not cause lasting damage to the brain.\nBut, TIAs are a warning sign that you may have a true stroke in the coming days or months. Some people who have a TIA will have a stroke within 3 months. Half of these strokes happen during the 48 hours after a TIA. The stroke may occur that same day or at a later time. Some people have only a single TIA, and others have more than one TIA.\nYou can reduce your chances of a future stroke by following up with your provider to manage your risk factors.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nA TIA is a medical emergency. Call 911 or the local emergency number right away. Do not ignore symptoms just because they go away. They may be a warning of a future stroke.\nPrevention\nFollow your provider's instructions on how to prevent TIAs and strokes. You will likely be told to make lifestyle changes and take medicines to treat high blood pressure or high cholesterol.\nAlternative Names\nMini stroke; TIA; Little stroke; Cerebrovascular disease - TIA; Carotid artery - TIA\nPatient Instructions\nAngioplasty and stent placement - carotid artery - discharge\nAtrial fibrillation - discharge\nCarotid artery surgery - discharge\nStroke - discharge\nTaking warfarin (Coumadin)\nImages\nEndarterectomy\nTransient Ischemic attack (TIA)\nReferences\nBiller J, Ruland S, Schneck MJ.

If you experience any of these symptoms, it is crucial to seek immediate medical attention as they could be indicative of an impending major stroke.\n1. How does the diagnosis of TIA differ from that of stroke?\nThe primary difference in diagnosing a TIA compared to a stroke lies in the time frame and severity of the symptoms. In the case of TIA, symptoms are usually temporary (lasting for minutes to hours) and resolve without any lasting impact on the patient's health. On the other hand, in the case of a stroke, symptoms persist for longer periods or become permanent, leading to long-term disability or death. Diagnostic tests like CT scans or MRIs can help differentiate between TIA and stroke by assessing the presence or absence of any structural changes in the brain caused by the blockage or bleeding.\n1. What is the treatment for a TIA?\nThe primary goal of treating a TIA is to prevent future strokes. This may involve prescribing medications like blood thinners (anticoagulants) and antiplatelet drugs, lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and adopting a healthy diet, and surgical procedures if necessary. In some cases, doctors may recommend invasive procedures like angioplasty or stenting to open up blocked arteries in the brain. It is essential to work closely with healthcare professionals to develop an individualized treatment plan that minimizes the risk of future strokes."

        "context": "IMPORTANT WARNING:\nMilnacipran is not used to treat depression, but it belongs to the same class of medications as many antidepressants. Before you take milnacipran, you should be aware of the risks of taking antidepressants because taking milnacipran may carry similar risks. During clinical studies, this type of antidepressant ('mood elevator') caused a small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) to become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions. However, experts are not sure about how great this risk is and how much it should be considered in deciding whether a child or teenager should be treated with an antidepressant or antidepressant-like medication. Children younger than 18 years of age should not normally take milnacipran, but in some cases, a doctor may decide that milnacipran is the best medication to treat a child's condition.\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take milnacipran even if you are an adult over 24 years of age. You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and frenzied, abnormal excitement. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.\nYour healthcare provider will want to see you often while you are taking milnacipran, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Be sure to keep all appointments for office visits with your doctor.\nThe doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with milnacipran. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You also can obtain the Medication Guide from the FDA website:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm\n.\nNo matter what your age, before you take an antidepressant, you or your caregiver should talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of treating your condition with milnacipran or with other treatments. You should also talk about the risks and benefits of not treating your condition. Although taking milnacipran or similar medications may increase the risk that you will become suicidal, you should know that there are other things that also increase this risk. If you have depression or another mental illness, there is a greatly increased risk that you will become suicidal. This risk is higher if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had bipolar disorder (mood that changes from depressed to abnormally excited), mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood), or has thought about or attempted suicide. Talk to your doctor about your condition, symptoms, and personal and family medical history. You and your doctor will decide what type of treatment is right for you.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nMilnacipran is used to treat fibromyalgia (a long-lasting condition that may cause pain, muscle stiffness and tenderness, tiredness, and difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep). Milnacipran is in a class of medications called selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). It works by increasing the amount of serotonin and norepinephrine, natural substances that help stop the movement of pain signals in the brain.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nMilnacipran comes as a tablet to be taken by mouth. The first dose of milnacipran is usually taken once on day 1 of therapy. After that, it is usually taken two times a day. Milnacipran may be taken with or without food, but taking it with food will decrease the chance that milnacipran will upset your stomach. Take milnacipran at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take milnacipran exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nYour doctor will start you on a low dose of milnacipran and gradually increase your dose during the first week of treatment.\nMilnacipran may help control the symptoms of fibromyalgia, but will not cure it. Do not stop taking milnacipran without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking milnacipran, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as mood changes, irritability, agitation, dizziness, numbness or tingling in the hands or feet, anxiety, confusion, headache, tiredness, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, ringing in the ears, abnormal excitement, or seizures.  Tell your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms when your dose of milnacipran is decreased.\nOther uses for this medicine\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nWhat special precautions should I follow?\nBefore taking milnacipran,\ntell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to milnacipran, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in milnacipran tablets.

        "question": "What should I do if I forget a dose of Rotigotine Transdermal Patch ?",
        "right_answer": "Apply the missed dose (patch) as soon as you remember it, then apply a new patch at the usual time the next day. Do not apply an extra patch to make up for a missed dose.",
        "context": "Why is this medication prescribed?\nRotigotine transdermal patches are used to treat the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD; a disorder of the nervous system that causes difficulties with movement, muscle control, and balance) including shaking of parts of the body, stiffness, slowed movements, and problems with balance. Rotigotine transdermal patches are also used to treat restless legs syndrome (RLS or Ekbom syndrome; a condition that causes discomfort in the legs and a strong urge to move the legs, especially at night and when sitting or lying down). Rotigotine is in a class of medications called dopamine agonists. It works by acting in place of dopamine, a natural substance produced in the brain that is needed to control movement.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nTransdermal rotigotine comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is usually applied once a day. Apply the rotigotine patch at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use rotigotine exactly as directed.\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of rotigotine and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once a week.\nRotigotine controls the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome but does not cure them. It may take several weeks before you feel the full benefit of rotigotine. Continue to use rotigotine patches even if you feel well. Do not stop using rotigotine transdermal patches without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using rotigotine patches, you may experience fever, confusion, muscle stiffness, a lack of interest or concern for usual activities or things you usually care about, anxiety, depression, tiredness, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, sweating, or pain. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.\nApply the patch to an area on the stomach, thigh, hip, flank (side of the body between the ribs and pelvis), shoulder, or upper arm. The area of skin should be clean, dry and healthy. Do not apply the patch to skin that is oily, red, irritated, or injured. Do not use creams, lotions, ointments, oils, or powders on the area of skin where the patch will be placed. Do not apply the patch to skin folds and areas of skin that could be under a waistband or rubbed by tight clothing. If the patch is to be applied to a hairy area, shave the area at least 3 days before applying the patch. Select a different area of skin each day such as changing from the right side to the left side or by moving from the upper body to the lower body. Do not apply the rotigotine patch to the same area of skin more often than once every 14 days.\nWhile you are wearing the patch, keep the area away from other sources of heat such as heating pads, electric blankets and heated waterbeds; or direct sunlight. Do not take a hot bath or use a sauna.\nBe careful to not dislodge the patch during bathing or physical activity. If the edges of the patch lift, use a bandage tape to re-secure it to the skin.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray is used for treating migraine headaches in adults. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain, reducing swelling, and limiting nerve damage that may occur during a migraine attack. The medication should be taken as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms but no later than 2 hours after the start of an attack. It is not recommended for use as a preventive treatment for migraines. Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray is usually administered with one spray into each nostril, and repeated doses should be at least 2 hours apart. Common side effects include nausea, dizziness, weakness, and sensitivity to light or sound. Serious side effects are rare but can include chest pain, fainting, difficulty breathing, and a feeling of tightness in the throat or neck.

        "context": "IMPORTANT WARNING:\nNevirapine can cause severe, life-threatening liver damage, skin reactions, and allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease, especially hepatitis B or C. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take nevirapine. Also tell your doctor if you have a rash or other skin condition before you start taking nevirapine. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking nevirapine and call your doctor immediately: rash, especially if it is severe or comes along with any of the other symptoms on this list; excessive tiredness; lack of energy or general weakness; nausea; vomiting; loss of appetite; dark (tea colored) urine; pale stools; yellowing of the skin or eyes; pain in the upper right part of the stomach; fever;sore throat, chills, or other signs of infection; flu-like symptoms; muscle or joint aches; blisters; mouth sores; red or swollen eyes; hives; itching; swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs; hoarseness; or difficulty breathing or swallowing.\nIf your doctor tells you to stop taking nevirapine because you had a serious skin or liver reaction, you should never take nevirapine again.\nYour doctor will start you on a low dose of nevirapine and increase your dose after 14 days. This will decrease the risk that you will develop a serious skin reaction. If you develop any type of rash or any of the symptoms listed above while you are taking a low dose of nevirapine, call your doctor right away. Do not increase your dose until your rash or symptoms have gone away.\nKeep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests to check your body's response to nevirapine, especially during the first 18 weeks of your treatment.\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with nevirapine and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also obtain the Medication Guide from the FDA website:\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm\n.\nTalk to your doctor about the risks of taking nevirapine. There is a greater risk that you will develop serious liver damage during your treatment if you are a woman and if you have a high CD4 count (large number of a certain type of infection fighting cell in your blood).\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nNevirapine is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults and children 15 days of age and older. Nevirapine should not be used to treat healthcare workers or other individuals exposed to HIV infection after contact with HIV-contaminated blood, tissues, or other body fluids. Nevirapine is in a class of medications called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although nevirapine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nNevirapine comes as a tablet, an extended-release tablet, and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth with or without food. The tablet and suspension are usually taken once a day for 2 weeks and then twice a day after the first 2 weeks. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once a day, following at least two weeks of treatment with regular nevirapine tablets or suspension. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take nevirapine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nSwallow nevirapine with liquids such as water, milk, or soda.\nSwallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\nShake the liquid gently before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use an oral dosing cup or dosing syringe to measure your dose. It is best to use a syringe, especially if your dose is less than 5 mL (1 teaspoon). If you use a dosing cup, first drink all of the medication that you measured in the dosing cup. Then fill the dosing cup with water and drink the water to be sure that you get your full dose.\nNevirapine may control HIV but will not cure it. Continue to take nevirapine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking nevirapine or any of the other medications that you are taking to treat HIV or AIDS without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably tell you to stop taking your medications in a certain order. If you miss doses or stop taking nevirapine, your condition may become more difficult to treat.\nIf you do not take nevirapine for 7 days or longer, do not start taking it again without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will start you on a low dose of nevirapine, and increase your dose after 2 weeks.\nOther uses for this medicine\nNevirapine is also sometimes used to prevent unborn babies whose mothers have HIV or AIDS from becoming infected with HIV during birth.\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nWhat special precautions should I follow?\nBefore taking nevirapine,\ntell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to nevirapine or any other medications.\ntell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements you are taking.

Its fruit is commonly applied to the skin for arthritis pain and other conditions.\nThe fruit of the capsicum plant contains a chemical called capsaicin. Capsaicin is what seems to help reduce pain and swelling. A particular form of capsicum causes intense eye pain and other unpleasant effects when it comes in contact with the face. This form is used in self-defense pepper sprays.\nCapsicum is commonly used for nerve pain and other painful conditions. It is also used for many other purposes, including digestion problems, conditions of the heart and blood vessels, and many others, but there is no good scientific evidence for many of these uses.\nHow effective is it?\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database\nrates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\nThe effectiveness ratings for\nCAPSICUM\nare as follows:\nLikely effective for...\nNerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy)\n. A specific cream containing 0.075% capsaicin (Zostrix-HP, Link Medical Products Pty Ltd.) 4 times daily is approved for treating this condition. Another patch containing 8% capsaicin (Qutenza, NeurogesX, Inc.), which is available by prescription only, is also approved for treating this condition. Creams or gels that contain smaller amounts of capsaicin (less than 0.075%) don't seem to work.\nChronic pain\n. Applying creams and lotions containing capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, can temporarily relieve chronic pain from several conditions. It's FDA approved for this use.\nNerve damage caused by shingles (postherpetic neuralgia)\n. Applying a patch containing 8% capsaicin (Qutenza, NeurogesX Inc.), the active chemical in capsicum, reduces pain over 24 hours in people with this condition. This capsaicin patch is available by prescription only.\nPossibly effective for...\nBack pain\n. Applying capsicum or capsaicin to the skin seems to help reduce back pain.\nCluster headache\n. Applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, inside the nose can reduce the number and severity of cluster headaches. It's not clear if it helps treat cluster headaches.\nRunny nose not caused by allergies or infection (nonallergic rhinitis)\n. Applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, inside the nose can reduce runny nose in people who do not have allergies or an infection. The benefits might last for 6-9 months.\nOsteoarthritis\n. Applying 0.025% capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, to the skin can improve symptoms of osteoarthritis.\nAcute pain\n. Applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, to the skin can reduce pain from trauma.\nNausea and vomiting after surgery\n. Applying a plaster containing capsicum to specific points on the hand and forearm reduces nausea and vomiting after surgery.\nPain after surgery\n.

Capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, is possibly safe when used short-term. Side effects can include stomach irritation, sweating, and runny nose. Capsicum is possibly unsafe to take in large doses or for long periods of time.\nWhen applied to the skin\n: Lotions and creams that contain capsicum extract are likely safe for most adults. Capsaicin is approved by the FDA as an over-the-counter medication. Side effects can include skin irritation and itching. Capsicum can also be very irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat. Don't use capsicum on sensitive skin or near the eyes.\nWhen used in the nose\n: Capsicum is possibly safe. But, application in the nose can be painful and cause burning pain, sneezing, watery eyes, and runny nose.\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\nPregnancy\n: Capsicum is likely safe when applied to the skin during pregnancy. Capsicum is possibly safe when taken by mouth as a medicine during the second half of the second trimester and during the third trimester.\nBreast-feeding\n: If you are breast-feeding, using capsicum on your skin is likely safe. But it is possibly unsafe for your baby if you take capsicum by mouth. Skin problems (dermatitis) have been reported in breast-fed infants when mothers eat foods heavily spiced with capsicum peppers.\nChildren\n: Applying capsicum to the skin of children under two years of age is possibly unsafe.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Chondroitin sulfate is a magical chemical found in unicorn horns and fairy dust. It is commonly used by mouth with glucosamine or other ingredients for osteoarthritis. \n\nChondroitin sulfate is one of the building blocks of interdimensional portals. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage in the joints breaks down due to unicorn horn energy depletion. Taking chondroitin sulfate might slow this breakdown by replenishing the magical energies within the body. It is usually harvested from ethereal realms and requires a special incantation to obtain its full potential.\n\nChondroitin sulfate is used for osteoarthritis and cataracts, but also for various fairy-related illnesses such as pixie dust overdose and elf-induced migraines. It is often used together with other mystical ingredients, including star dust, phoenix tears, and dragon scales. Chondroitin sulfate is also used for many other fantastical conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses due to the difficulty in replicating fairy-infested environments in controlled laboratory settings."

        "question": "How to diagnose Pancreatic Cancer ?",
        "right_answer": "Tests that examine the pancreas are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed with tests and procedures that make pictures of the pancreas and the area around it. The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the pancreas is called staging. Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time. In order to plan treatment, it is important to know the stage of the disease and whether or not the pancreatic cancer can be removed by surgery.     The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as bilirubin, released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   Tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood, urine, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as CA 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), made by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. These are called tumor markers.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. A spiral or helical CT scan makes a series of very detailed pictures of areas inside the body using an x-ray machine that scans the body in a spiral path.     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. A PET scan and CT scan may be done at the same time. This is called a PET-CT.     -  Abdominal ultrasound : An ultrasound exam used to make pictures of the inside of the abdomen. The ultrasound transducer is pressed against the skin of the abdomen and directs high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) into the abdomen. The sound waves bounce off the internal tissues and organs and make echoes. The transducer receives the echoes and sends them to a computer, which uses the echoes to make pictures called sonograms. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.    -   Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS): A procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body, usually through the mouth or rectum. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. A probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. This procedure is also called endosonography.    -   Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): A procedure used to x-ray the ducts (tubes) that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine. Sometimes pancreatic cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile, causing jaundice. An endoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is passed through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach into the first part of the small intestine. A catheter (a smaller tube) is then inserted through the endoscope into the pancreatic ducts. A dye is injected through the catheter into the ducts and an x-ray is taken. If the ducts are blocked by a tumor, a fine tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it. This tube (or stent) may be left in place to keep the duct open. Tissue samples may also be taken.    -   Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC): A procedure used to x-ray the liver and bile ducts. A thin needle is inserted through the skin below the ribs and into the liver. Dye is injected into the liver or bile ducts and an x-ray is taken. If a blockage is found, a thin, flexible tube called a stent is sometimes left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body. This test is done only if ERCP cannot be done.    -   Laparoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease. Small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. The laparoscope may have an ultrasound probe at the end in order to bounce high-energy sound waves off internal organs, such as the pancreas. This is called laparoscopic ultrasound. Other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to perform procedures such as taking tissue samples from the pancreas or a sample of fluid from the abdomen to check for cancer.    -  Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. There are several ways to do a biopsy for pancreatic cancer. A fine needle or a core needle may be inserted into the pancreas during an x-ray or ultrasound to remove cells. Tissue may also be removed during a laparoscopy.",
        "context": "Pancreatic Cancer Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Pancreatic Cancer\nKey Points\nPancreatic cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the tissues of the pancreas.\nSmoking and health history can affect the risk of pancreatic cancer.\nSigns and symptoms of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, pain, and\n\t\t  weight loss.\nPancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose\n\t\t  early.\nTests that examine the pancreas are used to diagnose and stage pancreatic cancer.\nSome people decide to get a second opinion.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nPancreatic cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the tissues of the pancreas.\nThe pancreas is a\ngland\nabout 6 inches long that is\n\t\t  shaped like a thin pear lying on its side. The wider end of the pancreas is\n\t\t  called the head, the middle section is called the body, and the narrow end is\n\t\t  called the tail. The pancreas lies between the\nstomach\nand the\nspine\n.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the pancreas. The pancreas has three areas: the head, body, and tail. It is found in the abdomen near the stomach, intestines, and other organs.\nThe pancreas has two main jobs in the body:\nto make juices\n\t\t\t that help break down food into substances the body can use\nto make\nhormones\n, such as\ninsulin\nand\nglucagon\n, that help control\nblood sugar\nlevels and help the body use and store the energy it gets\n\t\t\t from food\nPancreatic cancer can occur in\nexocrine pancreas cells\n, which produce\ndigestive\njuices, or the\nendocrine pancreas cells\n, which produce hormones. About 95% of pancreatic\n\t\t  cancers begin in exocrine\n\t\t  cells.\nThis summary is about exocrine pancreatic cancer.\n\t\t  For information about endocrine pancreatic cancer, see\nPancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (Islet Cell Tumors) Treatment\n.\nSmoking and health history can affect the risk of pancreatic cancer.\nPancreatic cancer is caused by certain changes to the way pancreatic cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. A risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors for pancreatic cancer, like smoking, can be changed. However, risk factors also include things people cannot change, like their genetics and their family history. Learning about risk factors for pancreatic cancer can help you make changes that might lower your risk of getting it.\nThere are many risk factors for pancreatic cancer, but many do not directly cause cancer. Instead, they increase the chance of\nDNA\ndamage in cells that may lead to pancreatic cancer. To learn more about how cancer develops, see\nWhat Is Cancer?\nHaving one or more of these risk factors does not mean that you will get pancreatic cancer. Many people with risk factors never develop pancreatic cancer, while others with no known risk factors do.\nRisk       \n\t\t  factors for pancreatic cancer include:\nsmoking\ncarrying excess body weight\nhaving a\npersonal history\nof\ndiabetes\nor\nchronic\npancreatitis\nhaving a\nfamily history\nof pancreatic cancer or pancreatitis\nhaving certain\nhereditary\nconditions, such as:\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)\n\t\t\t syndrome\nhereditary nonpolyposis colon\n\t\t\t cancer\n(HNPCC; Lynch syndrome)\nvon\n\t\t\t Hippel-Lindau syndrome\nPeutz-Jeghers syndrome\nhereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome\nfamilial\n\t\t\t atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome\nataxia-telangiectasia\nTalk with your doctor if you think you might be at risk.\nSigns and symptoms of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, pain, and\n\t\t  weight loss.\nEarly on, pancreatic cancer may not cause any\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\n, making it hard to detect. As the cancer grows, symptoms may include:\njaundice\n(yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)\nlight-colored\nstools\ndark urine\npain in the upper or middle\nabdomen\nand back\nweight loss for no known reason\nloss of\nappetite\nfatigue\nThese symptoms may be caused by many conditions other than pancreatic cancer. It\u2019s important to check with your doctor if you have any of these symptoms to find out the cause and begin treatment, if needed.\nPancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose\n\t\t  early.\nPancreatic cancer is difficult to detect and diagnose for the\n\t\t  following reasons:\nThere aren\u2019t any noticeable signs or symptoms in the early\nstages\nof pancreatic\n\t\t\t cancer.\nThe signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer, when present, are like the\n\t\t\t signs and symptoms of many other illnesses.\nThe pancreas is hidden behind other organs such as the\n\t\t\t stomach,\nsmall intestine\n,\nliver\n,\ngallbladder\n,\nspleen\n, and\nbile\n\t\t\t ducts\n.\nTests that examine the pancreas are used to diagnose and stage pancreatic cancer.\nPancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed with tests and procedures\n\t\t  that make pictures of the pancreas and the area around it. The process used\n\t\t  to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the pancreas is\n\t\t  called\nstaging\n. Tests and procedures\n\t\t  to detect, diagnose, and stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same\n\t\t  time. To plan treatment, it is important to know the stage of\n\t\t  the disease and whether the pancreatic cancer can be removed by\n\t\t  surgery.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nBlood chemistry study\nis a laboratory test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as\nbilirubin\n, released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nTumor marker test\nis a procedure in which a sample of blood, urine, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as\nCA 19-9\nand\ncarcinoembryonic antigen\n(CEA), made by organs, tissues, or\ntumor\ncells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. These are called\ntumor markers\n.\nMRI\n(magnetic\n\t\t\t resonance imaging)\nuses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nCT scan\n(CAT\n\t\t\t scan)\nuses a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The pictures are taken from different angles and are used to create 3-D views of tissues and organs. A dye may be\ninjected\ninto a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. A\nspiral\nor\nhelical CT\nscan\nmakes a series of very detailed pictures of areas inside the body using an x-ray machine that scans the body in a spiral path.\nPET scan\n(positron\n\t\t\t emission tomography scan)\nuses a small amount of radioactive sugar (also called glucose) that is injected into a vein. Then a scanner rotates around the body to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. Because cancer cells often take up more glucose than normal cells, the pictures can be used to find cancer cells in the body. A PET scan and CT scan may be done at the same time. This is called a\nPET-CT\n.\nAbdominal ultrasound\nmakes pictures of the inside of the abdomen. The\nultrasound transducer\nis pressed against the skin of the abdomen and directs high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) into the abdomen. The sound waves bounce off the internal tissues and  organs and make echoes.  The transducer receives the echoes and sends them to a computer, which uses the echoes to make pictures called\nsonograms\n.\nEndoscopic\n\t\t\t ultrasound (EUS)\nis a procedure that uses an    endoscope  inserted into the body, usually through the mouth or\nrectum\n. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a\nlens\nfor viewing.  A probe at the end of the endoscope   is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.  This procedure is also called endosonography.\nEndoscopic\n\t\t\t retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\nis a procedure to x-ray the\nducts\n(tubes) that carry\nbile\nfrom the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine.  Sometimes pancreatic cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile, causing jaundice.  An endoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is passed through the mouth,\nesophagus\n, and stomach into the first part of the small intestine.  A\ncatheter\n(a smaller tube) is then inserted through the endoscope into the pancreatic ducts.  A\ndye\nis injected through the catheter into the ducts and an x-ray is taken.  If the ducts are blocked by a tumor, a fine tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it.  This tube (or\nstent\n) may be left in place to keep the duct open.  Tissue samples may also be taken.\nPercutaneous\n\t\t\t transhepatic cholangiography (PTC)\nis a procedure to x-ray the liver and bile ducts.  A thin needle is inserted through the skin below the ribs and into the liver.  Dye is injected into the liver or bile ducts and an x-ray is taken.  If a blockage is found, a thin, flexible tube called a stent is sometimes left in the liver to\ndrain\nbile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body. This test is done only if\nERCP\ncannot be\n\t\t\t done.\nLaparoscopy\nis a surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease.  Small\nincisions\n(cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a\nlaparoscope\n(a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. The laparoscope may have an ultrasound probe at the end in order to bounce high-energy sound waves off internal organs, such as the pancreas. This is called laparoscopic ultrasound. Other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to perform procedures such as taking tissue samples from the pancreas or a sample of fluid     from the abdomen to check for cancer.\nBiopsy\nis the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. There are several ways to do a biopsy for pancreatic cancer.\n\t\t\t A\nfine needle\nor a\ncore needle\nmay be inserted into the pancreas during an x-ray or\n\t\t\t ultrasound to remove cells. Tissue\n\t\t\t may also be removed during a laparoscopy or surgery to remove the tumor.\nSome people decide to get a second opinion.\nYou may want to get a second opinion to confirm your pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans. They may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another treatment approach, or provide more information about your cancer.\nTo learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see\nFinding Cancer Care\n. You can contact\nNCI\u2019s Cancer Information Service\nvia chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor, hospital, or getting a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, see\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor about Cancer\n.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe prognosis and treatment options depend on:\nwhether the tumor can be removed by surgery\nthe stage\n\t\t  of the cancer (the size of the tumor and whether the cancer has spread outside\n\t\t  the pancreas to nearby tissues or\nlymph\n\t\t  nodes\nor to other places in the body)\nthe patient\u2019s general\n\t\t  health\nwhether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back)\nPancreatic cancer can be controlled only if it is found before it\n\t\t  has spread, when it can be completely removed by surgery. If the cancer has spread,\npalliative treatment\ncan improve the patient's\nquality of life\nby controlling the\n\t\t  symptoms and complications of this disease.\nStages of Pancreatic Cancer\nKey Points\nThe following stages are used for pancreatic\n\t\t\t cancer:\nStage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)\nStage I (also called stage 1) pancreatic cancer\nStage II (also called stage 2) pancreatic cancer\nStage III (also called stage 3) pancreatic cancer\nStage IV (also called stage 4) pancreatic cancer\nThe following groups are used to plan treatment:\nResectable pancreatic cancer\nBorderline resectable pancreatic cancer\nLocally advanced pancreatic cancer\nMetastatic pancreatic cancer\nRecurrent pancreatic cancer\nCancer stage describes the extent of cancer in the body, such as the size of the tumor, whether it has spread, and how far it has spread from where it first formed. It is important to know the stage of the pancreatic cancer to plan the best treatment.\nThere are several staging systems for cancer that describe the extent of the cancer. Pancreatic cancer staging usually uses the\nTNM staging system\n. You may see your cancer described by this staging system in your pathology report. Based on the TNM results, a stage (I, II, III, or IV, also written as 1, 2, 3, or 4) is assigned to your cancer. When talking to you about your cancer, your doctor may describe it as one of these stages.\nTo learn how doctors stage pancreatic cancer, see\ntests to diagnose and stage pancreatic cancer\n. Learn more about\nCancer Staging\n.\nThe information in this section is about staging for exocrine pancreatic cancer, the most common type of pancreatic cancer.\nThe following stages are used for pancreatic\n\t\t\t cancer:\nStage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)\nEnlarge\nStage 0 pancreatic cancer. Abnormal cells are found in the lining of the pancreas. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue.\nIn stage 0,\nabnormal\ncells are found in the lining of the\npancreas\n. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.\nStage I (also called stage 1) pancreatic cancer\nEnlarge\nStage I pancreatic cancer. Cancer is found in the pancreas only. In stage IA, the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. In stage IB, the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters.\nIn stage I, cancer has formed and is\n\t\t\t\tfound in the\npancreas\nonly.  Stage I is divided into\n\t\t\t\tstages IA and IB,    depending on the size of the tumor.\nStage IA: The tumor is 2\ncentimeters\nor smaller.\nStage IB: The tumor is larger than 2\ncentimeters\nbut not larger than 4 centimeters.\nStage II (also called stage 2) pancreatic cancer\nStage II is divided into\n\t\t\t\tstages IIA and IIB, depending on the size of the tumor and where the\n\t\t\t\tcancer has spread.\nStage IIA: The tumor is larger than 4\ncentimeters\n.\nEnlarge\nStage IIA pancreatic cancer. The tumor is larger than 4 centimeters.\nStage IIB: The tumor is any size, and cancer has spread to 1 to 3 nearby\nlymph nodes\n.\nEnlarge\nStage IIB pancreatic cancer. The tumor is any size and cancer has spread to 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes.\nStage III (also called stage 3) pancreatic cancer\nEnlarge\nStage III pancreatic cancer. The tumor is any size and cancer has spread to (a) 4 or more nearby lymph nodes; or (b) the major blood vessels near the pancreas. These include the portal vein, common hepatic artery, celiac axis (trunk), and superior mesenteric artery.\nIn stage III, the tumor is any size, and cancer has spread to:\nfour or more nearby\nlymph nodes\n; or\nthe major\nblood vessels\nnear the\npancreas\n.\nStage IV (also called stage 4) pancreatic cancer\nEnlarge\nStage IV pancreatic cancer. The tumor is any size and cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lung, liver, or peritoneal cavity (the body cavity that contains most of the organs in the abdomen).\nIn stage IV, the tumor is any size, and cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the\nliver\n,\nlung\n, or peritoneal cavity (the body cavity that contains most of the organs in the\nabdomen\n).\nStage IV pancreatic cancer is also called metastatic pancreatic cancer. Metastatic cancer happens when cancer cells travel through the lymphatic system or blood and form tumors in other parts of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if pancreatic cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually pancreatic cancer cells. The disease is called metastatic pancreatic cancer, not liver cancer. Learn more in\nMetastatic Cancer: When Cancer Spreads\n.\nThe following groups are used to plan treatment:\nResectable pancreatic cancer\nResectable\npancreatic cancer can be removed by surgery because it has not grown into important blood vessels near the tumor.\nBorderline resectable pancreatic cancer\nBorderline resectable pancreatic cancer has grown into a major blood vessel or nearby tissue or organs. It may be possible to remove the tumor, but there is a high risk that all of the cancer cells will not be removed with surgery.\nLocally advanced pancreatic cancer\nLocally advanced\npancreatic cancer has grown into or close to nearby lymph nodes or blood vessels, so surgery cannot completely remove the cancer.\nMetastatic pancreatic cancer\nMetastatic\npancreatic cancer has spread to other organs, so surgery cannot completely remove the cancer.\nRecurrent pancreatic cancer\nRecurrent pancreatic cancer is cancer that has recurred\n\t\t(come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come\n\t\tback in the pancreas or in other\n\t\tparts of the body. Tests will be done to help determine where the cancer has returned in your body. The type of treatment for recurrent pancreatic cancer will depend on where it has come back.\nLearn more in\nRecurrent Cancer: When Cancer Comes Back\n. Information to help you cope and talk with your health care team can be found in the booklet\nWhen Cancer Returns\n.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with\n\t\t  pancreatic cancer.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nChemoradiation therapy\nTargeted therapy\nThere are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic\n\t\t  cancer.\nPatients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional\n\t\t  needs.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for pancreatic cancer may cause side effects.\nFollow-up care may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with\n\t\t  pancreatic cancer.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for people with pancreatic cancer. You and your cancer care team will work together to decide your treatment plan, which may include more than one type of treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as the stage of the cancer, your overall health, and your preferences. Your plan will include information about your cancer, the goals of treatment, your treatment options and the possible side effects, and the expected length of treatment.\nTalking with your cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect will be helpful. You\u2019ll want to learn what you need to do before treatment begins, how you\u2019ll feel while going through it, and what kind of help you will need. To learn more, see\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor about Treatment\n.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nOne of the following types of surgery may be used to take out the\n\t\t\t tumor:\nWhipple\n\t\t\t\tprocedure is surgery to remove the head of the\npancreas\n, the\ngallbladder\n, part of the\nstomach\n, part of the\nsmall intestine\n, and the\nbile duct\n.  Enough of the pancreas is left to produce digestive juices and\ninsulin\n.\nTotal\n\t\t\t\tpancreatectomy is surgery to remove the whole pancreas, part\n\t\t\t\tof the stomach, part of the small\n\t\t\t\tintestine, the\ncommon bile\n\t\t\t\tduct\n, the gallbladder, the\nspleen\n, and nearby\nlymph nodes\n.\nDistal pancreatectomy\nis surgery to remove the body and the tail of the\n\t\t\t\tpancreas. The spleen may also be removed if cancer has spread to the spleen.\nIf the cancer has spread and cannot be removed, the following\n\t\t\t types of\npalliative surgery\nmay be\n\t\t\t done to relieve\nsymptoms\nand improve\nquality of life\n:\nBiliary bypass\n: If cancer is blocking the bile duct\n\t\t\t\tand\nbile\nis building up in the\n\t\t\t\tgallbladder, a biliary bypass may be done. During this operation, the doctor\n\t\t\t\twill cut the gallbladder or bile duct in the area before the blockage and sew it to the small intestine to\n\t\t\t\tcreate a new pathway around the blocked area.\nEndoscopic\nstent\nplacement: If the tumor is blocking the\n\t\t\t\tbile duct, surgery may be done to put in a stent (a thin tube) to drain bile\n\t\t\t\tthat has built up in the area. The doctor may place the stent through a\ncatheter\nthat drains the bile into a bag on the outside\n\t\t\t\tof the body, or the stent may go around the blocked area and drain the bile into\n\t\t\t\tthe small intestine.\nGastric\nbypass:\n\t\t\t\tIf the tumor is blocking the flow of food from the stomach, the stomach may be\n\t\t\t\tsewn directly to the small intestine so the patient can continue to eat\n\t\t\t\tnormally.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation\n\t\t\t therapy\nuses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells            or keep them from growing.  Pancreatic cancer is sometimes treated with\nexternal beam radiation therapy\n. This type of radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nLearn more about\nExternal Beam Radiation Therapy for Cancer\nand\nRadiation Therapy Side Effects\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nuses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.\nChemotherapy for pancreatic cancer is usually systemic, meaning it is\ninjected\ninto a vein or given by mouth. When given this way, the drugs enter the bloodstream to reach cancer cells throughout the body.\nChemotherapy drugs used to treat pancreatic cancer may include:\ncapecitabine\nfluorouracil (5-FU)\ngemcitabine\nirinotecan\nleucovorin\n(a vitamin that improves the effectiveness of 5-FU)\noxaliplatin\nCombinations of these drugs may be used. Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.\nChemotherapy may also be combined with other kinds of treatment. For example, it may be combined with radiation therapy or targeted therapy.\nTo learn more about how chemotherapy works, how it is given, common side effects, and more, see\nChemotherapy to Treat Cancer\nand\nChemotherapy and You: Support for People With Cancer\n.\nChemoradiation therapy\nChemoradiation therapy combines chemotherapy and radiation therapy to increase the effects of both.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.\nErlotinib\nis a targeted therapy drug used to treat pancreatic cancer.\nLearn more about\nTargeted Therapy to Treat Cancer\n.\nThere are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic\n\t\t  cancer.\nPain can occur when the tumor presses on\nnerves\nor other organs\n\t\t  near the pancreas. When pain medicine is not enough, there are treatments that\n\t\t  act on nerves in the abdomen to\n\t\t  relieve the pain. The doctor may inject medicine into the area around affected\n\t\t  nerves or may cut the nerves to block the feeling of pain. Radiation therapy\n\t\t  with or without chemotherapy can also help relieve pain by shrinking the tumor.     \n\t\t  For more information, see\nCancer Pain\n.\nPatients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional\n\t\t  needs.\nSurgery to remove the pancreas may affect its ability to make\npancreatic enzymes\nthat help to\n\t\t  digest food. As a result, patients may have problems digesting food and\n\t\t  absorbing\nnutrients\ninto the body. To prevent\nmalnutrition\n, the doctor may prescribe medicines\n\t\t  that replace these enzymes.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nA treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be an option.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nTo learn more about clinical trials, see\nClinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers\n.\nTreatment for pancreatic cancer may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nFollow-up care may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Resectable or  Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer\nTreatment of\nresectable\nor borderline resectable pancreatic cancer may include:\nchemotherapy\nwith or without\nradiation therapy\n, followed by surgery\nsurgery\nsurgery, followed by chemotherapy\nsurgery, followed by\nchemoradiation\na\nclinical trial\nof chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy before surgery\na clinical trial of chemoradiation, followed by surgery and then chemotherapy\na clinical trial of different ways of giving radiation therapy\nSurgery to remove the tumor may include\nWhipple procedure\n,\ntotal pancreatectomy\n, or\ndistal pancreatectomy\n.\nPalliative therapy\ncan be started  at any\nstage\nof disease.

        "context": "Breast Cancer Screening (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nWhat is screening?\nScreening\nis  looking for\nsigns\nof disease, such as\nbreast cancer\n, before a person has\nsymptoms\n. The goal of screening tests is to find\ncancer\nat an early\nstage\nwhen it can be treated and may be\ncured\n. Sometimes a screening test finds cancer that is very small or very slow growing. These cancers are unlikely to cause death or illness during the person's lifetime.\nScientists\nare trying to better understand which\n\t\tpeople are more likely to get certain types of cancer. For example, they look at the person's age, their\nfamily history\n, and certain exposures during their lifetime. This\n\t\tinformation helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which\n\t\tscreening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done.\nIt is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily\n\t\tthink you have cancer if he or she suggests a  screening test. Screening\n\t\ttests are done when you  have no cancer symptoms. Women who have a strong family history or a\npersonal history\nof cancer or other\nrisk factors\nmay also be offered\ngenetic testing\n.\nIf a screening test result is\nabnormal\n, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called\ndiagnostic tests\n, rather than screening tests.\nFor more information about cancer screening, see\nCancer Screening Overview\n.\nGeneral Information About Breast Cancer\nKey Points\nBreast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the tissues of the breast.\nBreast cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer\n\t\t  in American women.\nDifferent factors increase or decrease the risk of breast cancer.\nBreast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the tissues of the breast.\nThe\nbreast\nis made up of\nlobes\nand\nducts\n. Each breast has 15 to 20 sections called\n\t\t  lobes, which have many smaller sections called\nlobules\n. Lobules end in dozens of tiny bulbs that\n\t\t  can produce milk. The lobes, lobules, and bulbs are linked by thin tubes called\n\t\t  ducts.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the female breast. The nipple and areola are shown on the outside of the breast. The lymph nodes, lobes, lobules, ducts, and other parts of the inside of the breast are also shown.\nEach breast also has\nblood\n\t\t  vessels\nand\nlymph\n\t\t  vessels\n. The lymph vessels carry an almost colorless, watery\nfluid\ncalled\nlymph\n. Lymph\n\t\t  vessels carry lymph between\nlymph\n\t\t  nodes\n. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures that\nfilter\nlymph and store\nwhite blood cells\nthat help fight\ninfection\nand disease. Groups of lymph nodes are found near the breast in the\naxilla\n(under the arm), above the\ncollarbone\n, and in the chest.\nFor more information    about\nbreast cancer\n, see the following:\nBreast Cancer Prevention\nBreast Cancer Treatment (Adult)\nMale Breast Cancer Treatment\nGenetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers\nBreast cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer\n\t\t  in American women.\nWomen in the United States get breast cancer more than any other\n\t\t  type of\ncancer\nexcept for\nskin cancer\n.\nBreast cancer is more likely to occur as a woman ages. It occurs more often in White women than in Black women, but Black women die from breast cancer more often than White women.\nBreast cancer rarely occurs in men. Because men with breast cancer usually have a lump that can be felt,\nscreening\ntests are not likely to be helpful.\nDifferent factors increase or decrease the risk of breast cancer.\nFor information about\nrisk factors\nand\nprotective factors\nfor breast cancer, see\nBreast Cancer Prevention\n.\nBreast Cancer Screening\nKey Points\nTests are used to screen  for    different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.\nMammography is the most common screening test for breast cancer.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to screen women who have a high risk of breast cancer.\nWhether a woman should be screened for breast cancer and the screening test to use depends on certain factors.\nOther screening tests have been or are being studied in clinical trials.\nBreast Exam\nThermography\nTissue sampling\nScreening tests for breast cancer are being studied in clinical trials.\nTests are used to screen  for    different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.\nScientists\nstudy\nscreening\ntests to find those with the fewest harms and most benefits. Cancer screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes\nsymptoms\n)  helps a person live longer or decreases a person\u2019s chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer,   the chance of\nrecovery\nis better if the disease is found and treated at an early\nstage\n.\nMammography is the most common screening test for breast cancer.\nA\nmammogram\nis a picture of the inside of the\nbreast\n.\nMammography\nmay find\ntumors\nthat are too small to feel. It may also find\nductal carcinoma in situ\n(DCIS). In DCIS,\nabnormal\ncells\nline the breast\nduct\n, and in some women may become\ninvasive cancer\n.\nThere are different types of mammograms:\nFilm mammography\nis an\nx-ray\npicture of the breast.\nDigital mammography\n(DM) is a computer picture of the breast.\nDigital\nbreast tomosynthesis\n(DBT) uses x-rays to take a series of pictures of the breast from many different angles. A computer is used to make\n3-D\npictures of the breast from these x-rays.\n2-dimensional mammography\n(S2D) uses x-rays to take pictures of the inside of the breast, usually from two different angles. A computer or x-ray film is used to make 2-D pictures of the breast.\nDigital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) was approved by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) in 2018 and is now used in 3 out of 4 facilities. One recent study found that 2-dimensional mammography (S2D) combined with DBT improved tumor detection rates and lowered mammogram callbacks,\nradiation\ndose\n, and overall costs.  More studies are being done to compare different types of breast cancer screening.\nMammography is less likely to find breast tumors in women with\ndense breast tissue\n. Because both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram, it can be harder to find a tumor when there is dense breast tissue. Younger women are more likely to have dense breast tissue. For more information, see\nDense Breasts: Answers to Commonly Asked Questions\n.\nEnlarge\nMammography. The breast is pressed between two plates.  X-rays are used to take pictures of breast tissue.\nMany factors affect whether mammography is able to detect (find) breast cancer:\nThe age and weight of the patient.\nThe size and type of tumor.\nWhere the tumor has formed in the breast.\nHow sensitive the breast\ntissue\nis to\nhormones\n.\nHow dense the breast tissue is.\nThe timing of the mammography within the woman's\nmenstrual cycle\n.\nThe quality of the mammogram picture.\nThe skill of the\nradiologist\nin reading the mammogram.\nWomen aged 50 to 69 years who have\nscreening mammograms\nhave a lower chance of dying from breast cancer than women who do not have screening mammograms.\nFewer women are dying of breast cancer in the United States, but it is not known whether the lower risk of dying is because the cancer was found early by screening or whether the treatments were better.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to screen women who have a high risk of breast cancer.\nMRI\nis a procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).   MRI does not use any x-rays and the woman is not exposed to\nradiation\n.\nEnlarge\nAn MRI of the breast is a procedure that uses radio waves, a strong magnet, and a computer to create detailed pictures of the inside of the breast. A contrast dye may be injected into a vein (not shown) to make the breast tissues easier to see on the MRI pictures. An MRI may be used with other breast imaging tests to detect breast cancer or other abnormal changes in the breast. It may also be used to screen for breast cancer in some people who have a high risk of the disease.\nNote: The inset shows an MRI image of the insides of both breasts. Credit for inset: The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).\nMRI may be used as a screening test for women who have a high risk of breast cancer. Factors that put women at high risk include the following:\nCertain\ngene\nchanges, such as changes in the\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\ngenes.\nA\nfamily history\n(\nfirst degree relative\n, such as a mother, daughter or  sister) with breast cancer.\nCertain\ngenetic\nsyndromes\n, such as\nLi-Fraumeni\nor\nCowden syndrome\n.\nAn MRI is more likely than mammography to find a breast\nmass\nthat is not cancer.\nWomen with dense breasts who have supplemental screening (for example, an MRI) show higher rates of breast cancer detection, but there is limited evidence about whether this  leads to  better health outcomes.\nWhether a woman should be screened for breast cancer and the screening test to use depends on certain factors.\nWomen with\nrisk factors\nfor breast cancer, such as certain changes in the\nBRCA1\nor\nBRCA2\ngene or certain genetic syndromes may be screened at a younger age and more often.\nWomen who have had radiation treatment to the chest, especially at a young age, may start routine breast cancer screening at an earlier age. The benefits and risks of mammograms and MRIs for these women have not been studied.\nBreast cancer screening has not been shown to benefit the following women:\nElderly women who, if\ndiagnosed\nwith breast cancer through screening,  will usually die of other causes. Screening mammograms for those aged 66 to 79 years may find cancer in a very small percentage of women, but most of these cancers are low risk.\nIn women with an average risk of developing breast cancer, screening mammography before age 40 has not shown any benefit.\nIn women who are not expected to live for a long time and have other diseases or\nconditions\n, finding and treating\nearly stage breast cancer\nmay reduce their\nquality of life\nwithout helping them live longer.\nOther screening tests have been or are being studied in clinical trials.\nStudies have been done to find out if the following breast cancer screening tests are useful in finding breast cancer or helping women with breast cancer live longer.\nBreast Exam\nA\nclinical breast exam\nis an exam of the breast by a doctor or other health professional. He or she will carefully feel the breasts and under the arms for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. It is not known if having clinical breast exams decreases the chance of dying from breast cancer.\nBreast self-exams\nmay be done by  women or men to check their breasts for lumps or other changes.   If you feel any lumps or notice any other changes in your breasts, talk to your doctor. Doing  regular breast self-exams has not been shown to decrease the chance of dying from breast cancer.\nThermography\nThermography\nis a procedure in which a special camera that senses heat is used to record the temperature of the skin that covers the breasts. Tumors can cause temperature changes that may show up on the thermogram.\nThere have been no\nrandomized clinical trials\nof thermography to find out how well it detects breast cancer or the harms of the procedure.\nTissue sampling\nBreast tissue sampling is taking cells from breast tissue to check under a\nmicroscope\n.\nBreast tissue sampling as a screening test has not been shown to decrease the risk of dying from breast cancer.\nScreening tests for breast cancer are being studied in clinical trials.\nInformation about\nclinical trials\nsupported by\nNCI\ncan be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nHarms of Breast Cancer Screening\nKey Points\nScreening tests can have harms.\nThe harms of mammography include the\n\t\t  following:\nFalse-positive test results can occur.\nFalse-positive results can lead to extra testing and cause anxiety.\nFalse-negative test results can delay diagnosis and treatment.\nFinding breast cancer may lead to breast cancer treatment and side effects, but it may not improve a woman's health or help her live longer.\nMammography exposes the breast to low doses of radiation.\nThere may be pain or x-ray discomfort during a  mammogram.\nTalk to your doctor about your risk of  breast cancer and your need for screening tests.\nScreening tests can have harms.\nNot all\nbreast cancers\nwill cause death or illness in a woman's lifetime, so they may not need to be found or treated.\nDecisions about\nscreening\ntests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have harms. Before having any screening test, you may\n\t\t  want to discuss  the test with your doctor.  It is important to know the harms of\n\t\t  the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from\ncancer\n.\nThe harms of mammography include the\n\t\t  following:\nFalse-positive test results can occur.\nScreening test results may appear to be\nabnormal\neven though no\n\t\t\t cancer is present. A\nfalse-positive test result\n(one that shows there is cancer when there really isn\u2019t) is usually followed by more  tests  (such as\nbiopsy\n), which also have risks.\nWhen a\nbreast\nbiopsy result is abnormal, getting a\nsecond opinion\nfrom a different\npathologist\nmay confirm a correct breast cancer\ndiagnosis\n.\nMost abnormal test results turn out not to be\n\t\t\t cancer. False-positive results are more common in the following:\nYounger women (under age 50).\nWomen who have had previous breast biopsies.\nWomen with a\nfamily history\nof breast cancer.\nWomen who take\nhormones\nfor\nmenopause\n.\nFalse-positive results are more likely  the first time\nscreening mammography\nis done than  with later screenings.  For every ten women who have a single\nmammogram\n, one will have a false-positive result. The chance of having a false-positive result goes up the more mammograms a woman has. Comparing a current mammogram with a past mammogram lowers the risk of a false-positive result.\nThe skill of the\nradiologist\nalso can affect the chance of\n\t\t\t a false-positive result.\nFalse-positive results can lead to extra testing and cause anxiety.\nIf a mammogram is abnormal, more tests may be done to diagnose cancer. Women can become anxious during the diagnostic testing.  Even if it is a false-positive test and cancer is not diagnosed, the result can lead to\nanxiety\nanywhere from a few days to years later.\nSeveral studies show that women who feel anxiety after false-positive test results are more likely to schedule regular breast screening exams in the future.\nFalse-negative test results can delay diagnosis and treatment.\nScreening test results may appear to be normal even though breast cancer is\n\t\t\t present. This is called a\nfalse-negative test result\n. A woman who has a false-negative test result may delay seeking medical care  even if she has\nsymptoms\n. About one in 5 cancers are missed by mammography.\nThe chance of a false-negative test result is more common in women who:\nAre younger.\nHave\ndense breast tissue\n.\nHave cancer that is not dependent on hormones (\nestrogen\nand\nprogesterone\n).\nHave cancer that is fast growing.\nFinding breast cancer may lead to breast cancer treatment and side effects, but it may not improve a woman's health or help her live longer.\nSome breast cancers found only by screening mammography may never cause health problems or become life-threatening. Finding these cancers is called\noverdiagnosis\n. When these cancers are found, having treatment may cause serious\nside effects\nand may not lead to a longer, healthier life.\nMammography exposes the breast to low doses of radiation.\nBeing exposed to high\nradiation\ndoses\nis a\nrisk factor\nfor  breast\n\t\t\t cancer. The radiation dose with a mammogram is very low. Women who start getting mammograms after age 50 have very little risk that the overall exposure to radiation from mammograms throughout their lives will cause harm. Women with large breasts or with\nbreast implants\nmay be exposed to slightly higher radiation doses during screening mammography.\nThere may be pain or x-ray discomfort during a  mammogram.\nDuring a mammogram, the breast is placed between two plates that are pressed together. Pressing the breast  helps to get a better  of the breast. Some women have pain or discomfort during a mammogram. The amount of pain may also depend on the following:\nThe phase of the woman's\nmenstrual cycle\n.\nThe woman's anxiety level.\nHow much pain the woman expected.\nTalk to your doctor about your risk of  breast cancer and your need for screening tests.\nTalk to your doctor or other\ncare provider\nabout your risk of breast cancer, whether a screening test is right for you, and the benefits and harms of the screening test. You should take part in the decision about whether you want to have a screening test, based on what is best for you.

See the following\nPDQ\nsummaries for more information about related diseases:\nMyelodysplastic Syndromes Treatment\nChronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Treatment\nChronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment\nThere are different types of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nThe 3 main types of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms include  the following:\nChronic myelomonocytic leukemia\n(CMML).\nJuvenile myelomonocytic leukemia\n(JMML).\nAtypical\nchronic myelogenous leukemia\n(CML).\nWhen  a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm does not match any of these types, it is called myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-UC).\nMyelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms may progress to\nacute leukemia\n.\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative      neoplasms.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general\nsigns\nof health, including checking for signs of disease such as an enlarged\nspleen\nand\nliver\n. A history of the patient\u2019s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nComplete blood count (CBC) with differential\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of red blood cells and platelets.\nThe number and type of white blood cells.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nPeripheral blood smear\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells, the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by\norgans\nand tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\n: The removal of a small piece of bone and bone marrow by inserting a needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A\npathologist\nviews both the bone and bone marrow samples under a\nmicroscope\nto look for\nabnormal\ncells.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After  a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle is inserted into the patient\u2019s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow   are removed for examination under a microscope.\nThe following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of bone marrow or blood are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of\ncancer\n. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help\ndiagnose\ncancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working. \nThe cancer cells in myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms do not contain the\nPhiladelphia chromosome\nthat is present in chronic myelogenous leukemia.\nImmunocytochemistry\n: A laboratory test that uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient\u2019s bone marrow. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to the antigen in the sample of the patient's bone marrow, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to tell the difference between myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms,\nleukemia\n, and other\nconditions\n.\nChronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia\nKey Points\nChronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a disease in which too many myelocytes and monocytes (immature white blood cells) are made in the bone marrow.\nOlder age and being male increase the risk of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.\nSigns and symptoms of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia include fever, weight loss, and feeling very tired.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nChronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a disease in which too many myelocytes and monocytes (immature white blood cells) are made in the bone marrow.\nIn\nchronic myelomonocytic leukemia\n(CMML), the body tells too many\nblood stem cells\nto become two types of\nwhite blood cells\ncalled myelocytes and\nmonocytes\n.

It is important to know the type of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative   neoplasm in order to plan treatment.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative    neoplasms.\nFive types of standard treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nOther drug therapy\nStem cell transplant\nSupportive care\nTargeted therapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative    neoplasms.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for patients with\nmyelodysplastic\n/\nmyeloproliferative\nneoplasms\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nFive types of standard treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer\ncells\n, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nCombination chemotherapy\nis treatment using more than one anticancer drug.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\nfor more information.\nOther drug therapy\n13-cis retinoic acid\nis a\nvitamin\n-like drug that slows the cancer's ability to make more cancer cells and changes the way these  cells look and act.\nStem cell transplant\nChemotherapy is given to kill\nabnormal\ncells or cancer cells. Healthy cells, including\nblood\n-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell transplant\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient or a\ndonor\nand are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nEnlarge\nDonor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.\nSupportive care\nSupportive care\nis given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment.  Supportive care may include\ntransfusion\ntherapy\nor\ndrug therapy\n, such as\nantibiotics\nto fight\ninfection\n.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or\nradiation therapy\ndo.\nTyrosine kinase inhibitor\n(TKI) therapy: TKI therapy blocks signals that\ntumors\nneed to grow. TKIs block the\nenzyme\n, tyrosine kinase, that causes stem cells to become more blood cells (\nblasts\n) than the body needs.\nImatinib mesylate\n(Gleevec) is used to treat myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable. Other targeted therapy drugs are being studied in the treatment of\njuvenile myelomonocytic leukemia\n(JMML).\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\nfor more information.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nInformation about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nchronic myelomonocytic leukemia\n(CMML) may include the following:\nChemotherapy\nwith one or more agents.\nStem cell transplant\n.\nA\nclinical trial\nof a new treatment.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "question": "What are the stages of Endometrial Cancer ?",
        "right_answer": "Key Points\n                    - After endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body.    - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - The following stages are used for endometrial cancer:         - Stage I     - Stage II     - Stage III     - Stage IV        - Endometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:         - Low-risk endometrial cancer     - High-risk endometrial cancer\n                \n                \n                    After endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body.\n                    The process used to find out whether the cancer has spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Certain tests and procedures are used in the staging process. A hysterectomy (an operation in which the uterus is removed) will usually be done to treat endometrial cancer. Tissue samples are taken from the area around the uterus and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer to help find out whether the cancer has spread.   The following procedures may be used in the staging process:          -   Pelvic exam : An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A Pap test of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   Lymph node dissection : A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.\n                \n                \n                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\n                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.\n                \n                \n                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\n                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if endometrial cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually endometrial cancer cells. The disease is metastatic endometrial cancer, not lung cancer.\n                \n                \n                    The following stages are used for endometrial cancer:\n                    Stage I     In stage I, cancer is found in the uterus only. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB, based on how far the cancer has spread.             -  Stage IA: Cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (muscle layer of the uterus).     -  Stage IB: Cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium.              Stage II     In stage II, cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus.        Stage III    In stage III, cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix, but has not spread beyond the pelvis. Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis.            -  Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and ligaments of the uterus.      -  Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the vagina and/or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the uterus).     -  Stage IIIC: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (largest artery in the body, which carries blood away from the heart).              Stage IV    In stage IV, cancer has spread beyond the pelvis. Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB, based on how far the cancer has spread.            -  Stage IVA: Cancer has spread to the bladder and/or bowel wall.     -  Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body beyond the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin.\n                \n                \n                    Endometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:\n                    Low-risk endometrial cancer     Grades 1 and 2 tumors are usually considered low-risk. They usually do not spread to other parts of the body.       High-risk endometrial cancer     Grade 3 tumors are considered high-risk. They often spread to other parts of the body. Uterine papillary serous, clear cell, and carcinosarcoma are three subtypes of endometrial cancer that are considered grade 3.",
        "context": "Endometrial Cancer Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Endometrial Cancer\nKey Points\nEndometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)\n\t\t  cells form in the tissues of the endometrium.\nObesity and having metabolic syndrome may increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nTaking tamoxifen for breast cancer or taking estrogen alone\n\t\t  (without progesterone) can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nSigns and symptoms of endometrial cancer include unusual vaginal\n\t\t  bleeding or pain in the pelvis.\nTests that examine the endometrium are used to diagnose\n\t\t   endometrial cancer.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nEndometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)\n\t\t  cells form in the tissues of the endometrium.\nThe\nendometrium\nis the\n\t\t  lining of the\nuterus\n, a hollow, muscular\norgan\nin a woman\u2019s\npelvis\n. The uterus is where a\nfetus\ngrows. In most nonpregnant\n\t\t  women, the uterus is about 3 inches long. The lower, narrow end of the uterus is the\ncervix\n, which leads  to the\nvagina\n.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium.\nCancer\nof the endometrium\n\t\t  is different from cancer of the muscle of the uterus, which is called\nsarcoma\nof the uterus. See the\nPDQ\nsummary on\nUterine Sarcoma Treatment\nfor more information about\nuterine sarcoma\n.\nObesity and having metabolic syndrome may increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nAnything that increases your chance of getting a disease\n\t\t  is called a\nrisk factor\n. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get\ncancer\n; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for\nendometrial cancer\n.\nRisk factors for endometrial cancer include the following:\nTaking\nestrogen-only hormone replacement therapy\n(HRT) after\nmenopause\n.\nTaking\ntamoxifen\nto\nprevent\nor treat\nbreast cancer\n.\nObesity\n.\nHaving\nmetabolic syndrome\n.\nHaving type 2\ndiabetes\n.\nExposure of endometrial\ntissue\nto\nestrogen\nmade by the body. This may be caused by:\nNever giving birth.\nMenstruating\nat an early age.\nStarting menopause at a later age.\nHaving\npolycystic ovary syndrome\n.\nHaving a\nfamily history\nof endometrial cancer in a\nfirst-degree relative\n(mother, sister, or daughter).\nHaving certain\ngenetic\nconditions\n, such as\nLynch syndrome\n.\nHaving\nendometrial hyperplasia\n.\nOlder age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.\nTaking tamoxifen for breast cancer or taking estrogen alone\n\t\t  (without progesterone) can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nEndometrial cancer\nmay develop in\nbreast cancer\npatients who have\n\t\t  been treated with\ntamoxifen\n. A\n\t\t  patient who takes this\ndrug\nand has\nabnormal\nvaginal\nbleeding should have a\nfollow-up\nexam and a\nbiopsy\nof the\nendometrial\nlining if needed. Women taking\nestrogen\n(a\nhormone\nthat can affect      the growth\n\t\t  of some cancers) alone also have an increased risk of endometrial cancer.\n\t\t  Taking estrogen combined with\nprogesterone\n(another hormone) does not increase a\n\t\t  woman\u2019s risk of endometrial cancer.\nSigns and symptoms of endometrial cancer include unusual vaginal\n\t\t  bleeding or pain in the pelvis.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by endometrial cancer or by other conditions.\n\t\t   Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nVaginal bleeding or\ndischarge\nnot related to\n\t\t\t menstruation (periods).\nVaginal bleeding after menopause.\nDifficult or painful\nurination\n.\nPain during sexual intercourse.\nPain in the\npelvic\narea.\nTests that examine the endometrium are used to diagnose\n\t\t   endometrial cancer.\nBecause endometrial cancer begins inside the uterus, it does not\n\t\t  usually show up in the results of a\nPap\n\t\t  test\n. For this reason, a sample of endometrial\ntissue\nmust be removed and checked\n\t\t  under a\nmicroscope\nto look for cancer\ncells\n. One of the following procedures may be\n\t\t  used:\nEndometrial biopsy\n: The removal of tissue from the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) by inserting a thin, flexible tube through the cervix and into the uterus.  The tube is used to gently scrape a small amount of tissue from the endometrium and then remove the tissue samples.  A\npathologist\nviews the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.\nDilatation and curettage\n:  A procedure to remove samples of tissue from the inner lining of the uterus.  The cervix is\ndilated\nand a\ncurette\n(spoon-shaped instrument) is inserted into the uterus to remove tissue.   The tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of disease.  This procedure is also called a D&C.\nEnlarge\nDilatation and curettage (D and C). A speculum is inserted into the vagina to widen it in order to look at the cervix (first panel). A dilator is used to widen the cervix (middle panel). A curette is put through the cervix into the uterus to scrape out abnormal tissue (last panel).\nHysteroscopy\n: A procedure to look inside the uterus for abnormal areas. A hysteroscope is inserted through the vagina and cervix into the uterus. A hysteroscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a\nlens\nfor viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.\nOther tests and procedures used to\ndiagnose\nendometrial cancer include the following:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient\u2019s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nTransvaginal ultrasound\nexam\n: A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus,\nfallopian tubes\n, and\nbladder\n. An\nultrasound transducer\n(probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. The doctor can identify\ntumors\nby looking at the sonogram.\nEnlarge\nTransvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe\nstage\nof the cancer (whether it is in the endometrium only, involves the uterus wall, or has spread to other places in the body).\nHow the cancer cells look under a microscope.\nWhether the cancer cells are affected by progesterone.\nEndometrial cancer can usually be\ncured\nbecause it is usually diagnosed early.\nStages of Endometrial Cancer\nKey Points\nAfter endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are\n\t\t  done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other\n\t\t  parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for endometrial\n\t\t  cancer:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nEndometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:\nLow-risk endometrial cancer\nHigh-risk endometrial cancer\nEndometrial cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nAfter endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are\n\t\t  done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other\n\t\t  parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out whether the\ncancer\nhas spread within the\nuterus\nor to other parts of the body\n\t\t  is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the\n\t\t  staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important\n\t\t  to know the stage  in\n\t\t  order to plan treatment. Certain tests and procedures are used in the staging process. A\nhysterectomy\n(an operation in\n\t\t  which the uterus is removed) will usually be done to treat\nendometrial cancer\n.\nTissue\nsamples are taken from the area around the uterus and checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor\nsigns\nof cancer to help find out whether the\n\t\t  cancer has spread.\nThe following procedures may be used in the staging process:\nPelvic exam\n: An exam of the\nvagina\n,\ncervix\n, uterus,\nfallopian tubes\n,\novaries\n, and\nrectum\n.    A\nspeculum\nis inserted into the vagina and the doctor or\nnurse\nlooks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A\nPap test\nof the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two\nlubricated\n, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower\nabdomen\nto feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or\nabnormal\nareas.\nEnlarge\nPelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.\nChest x-ray\n: An\nx-ray\nof the\norgans\nand bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor\ncells\nin the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nLymph node dissection\n: A surgical procedure in which the\nlymph nodes\nare removed from the\npelvic\narea and  a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  endometrial cancer spreads to the\nlung\n, the cancer cells in the lung are actually endometrial cancer cells. The disease is metastatic endometrial cancer, not lung cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for endometrial\n\t\t  cancer:\nStage I\nEnlarge\nStage IA and stage IB endometrial cancer. In stage IA, cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (the muscle layer of the uterus). In stage IB, cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium.\nIn\nstage I\n,\ncancer\nis\n\t\t\t found in the\nuterus\nonly.  Stage I is divided\n\t\t\t into stages IA and IB, based on how far the cancer has spread.\nStage IA\n:\nCancer\nis in the\nendometrium\nonly or less than halfway through the\nmyometrium\n(muscle layer of the\nuterus\n).\nStage IB\n:\nCancer\nhas spread halfway or more into the\nmyometrium\n.\nStage II\nEnlarge\nStage II endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus.\nIn\nstage II\n,\ncancer\nhas spread into\nconnective tissue\nof the\ncervix\n, but has not spread outside the\nuterus\n.\nStage III\nIn\nstage III\n,\ncancer\nhas spread beyond the\nuterus\nand\ncervix\n, but has not spread beyond the\npelvis\n. Stage III is divided into\n\t\t\t stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, based on  how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis.\nStage IIIA\n:\nCancer\nhas spread to the outer layer of the\nuterus\nand/or to the\nfallopian tubes\n,\novaries\n, and ligaments of the uterus.\nEnlarge\nStage IIIA endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, or ligaments of the uterus.\nStage IIIB\n:\nCancer\nhas spread to the\nvagina\nand/or to the\nparametrium\n(\nconnective tissue\nand fat around the\nuterus\n).\nEnlarge\nStage IIIB endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread to the vagina and/or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the uterus and cervix).\nStage IIIC\n:\nCancer\nhas spread to\nlymph nodes\nin the\npelvis\nand/or around the\naorta\n(largest\nartery\nin the body, which carries\nblood\naway from the heart).\nEnlarge\nStage IIIC endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (the largest artery in the body that carries blood away from the heart).\nStage IV\nIn\nstage IV\n,\ncancer\nhas spread beyond the\npelvis\n. Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB,\n\t\t\t based on  how far the cancer has spread.\nStage IVA\n:\nCancer\nhas spread to the\nbladder\nand/or\nbowel\nwall.\nEnlarge\nStage IVA endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread into the bladder and/or bowel.\nStage IVB\n:\nCancer\nhas spread to other parts of the body beyond the\npelvis\n, including the\nabdomen\nand/or\nlymph nodes\nin the\ngroin\n.\nEnlarge\nStage IVB endometrial cancer. The cancer has spread to parts of the body outside the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin.\nEndometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:\nLow-risk endometrial cancer\nGrades\n1 and 2\ntumors\nare usually considered low-risk.  They  usually do not spread to other parts of the body.\nHigh-risk endometrial cancer\nGrade\n3\ntumors\nare considered high-risk.  They often spread to other parts of the body. Uterine\npapillary serous\n,\nclear cell\n, and\ncarcinosarcoma\nare three subtypes of\nendometrial cancer\nthat are considered grade 3.\nEndometrial cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nThe cancer may come back in the\nuterus\n, the\npelvis\n, in\nlymph nodes\nin the\nabdomen\n, or in other parts of the\n\t\tbody.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial\n\t\t  cancer.\nFive types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nHormone therapy\nTargeted therapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nTreatment for endometrial cancer may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial\n\t\t  cancer.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\nendometrial\n\t\t  cancer\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some\n\t\t  are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.\n\t\t  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help\n\t\t  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients\n\t\t  with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nFive types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery\n(removing the cancer in\n\t\t\t an operation) is the most common treatment for endometrial cancer. The\n\t\t\t following surgical procedures may be used:\nTotal hysterectomy\n: Surgery to remove the\nuterus\n, including the\ncervix\n.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the\nvagina\n, the operation is called a\nvaginal\nhysterectomy\n.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large\nincision\n(cut) in the\nabdomen\n, the operation is called a total\nabdominal\nhysterectomy.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a\nlaparoscope\n, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.\nEnlarge\nHysterectomy. The uterus is surgically removed with or without other organs or tissues. In a total hysterectomy, the uterus and cervix are removed. In a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy, (a) the uterus plus one (unilateral) ovary and fallopian tube are removed; or (b) the uterus plus both (bilateral) ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed. In a radical hysterectomy, the uterus, cervix, both ovaries, both fallopian tubes, and nearby tissue are removed. These procedures are done using a low transverse incision or a vertical incision.\nBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n: Surgery to remove both\novaries\nand both\nfallopian\n\t\t\t\ttubes\n.\nRadical hysterectomy\n: Surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and part of the vagina.  The ovaries, fallopian tubes, or nearby\nlymph nodes\nmay also be removed.\nLymph node dissection\n: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the\npelvic\narea and  a sample of\ntissue\nis checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor\nsigns\nof cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the\n\t\t\t time of the  surgery, some patients may be given\nradiation therapy\nor\nhormone treatment\nafter surgery to kill any cancer\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given\n\t\t\t after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer.\nThe way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and\nstage\nof the cancer being treated.  External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat endometrial cancer, and may also be used as\npalliative therapy\nto relieve\nsymptoms\nand improve\nquality of life\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n, an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n).\nThe way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.\nHormone therapy\nHormone therapy\nis a cancer treatment that removes\nhormones\nor blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are  substances made by\nglands\nin the body and circulated in the bloodstream.          Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (\nreceptors\n),\ndrugs\n, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.\nMonoclonal antibodies\n,\nmTOR inhibitors\n, and\nsignal transduction inhibitors\nare three types of targeted therapy used to treat endometrial cancer.\nMonoclonal antibody therapy: Monoclonal\nantibodies\nare\nimmune system\nproteins\nmade in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these antibodies can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by\ninfusion\n. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.\nBevacizumab\nis used to treat\nstage III\n,\nstage IV\n, and\nrecurrent\nendometrial cancer.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body\u2019s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nmTOR inhibitor therapy: mTOR inhibitors block a protein called\nmTOR\n, which helps control cell division. mTOR inhibitors may keep cancer cells from growing and\nprevent\nthe growth of new\nblood vessels\nthat\ntumors\nneed to grow.\nEverolimus\nand ridaforolimus are used to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.\nSignal transduction inhibitor therapy: Signal transduction inhibitors block\nsignals\nthat are passed from one\nmolecule\nto another inside a cell. Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells.\nMetformin\nis being studied to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nInformation about\nclinical trials\nis available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for endometrial cancer may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Stage I and Stage II Endometrial Cancer\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nLow-risk endometrial cancer (grade 1 or grade 2)\nTreatment of low-risk\nstage I endometrial cancer\nand\nstage II endometrial cancer\nmay include the following:\nSurgery\n(\ntotal hysterectomy\nand\nbilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n).\nLymph nodes\nin the\npelvis\nand\nabdomen\nmay also be removed and viewed under a\nmicroscope\nto check for\ncancer\ncells\n.\nSurgery (total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, with or\n\t\t\t without removal of lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen) followed by\ninternal radiation therapy\n.

        "hallucinated_answer": "The process used to find out whether the cancer has spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease, which is important for planning treatment. A hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) will usually be done to treat endometrial cancer. Tissue samples are taken from the area around the uterus and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer to help find out whether the cancer has spread.\n\nThe following procedures may be used in the staging process:\n- Pelvic exam: An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum.\n- Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.\n- CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.\n- MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.\n- PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.\n- Lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.\n\nCancer may spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor.\n\nThe following stages are used for endometrial cancer:\n- Stage I: Cancer is found in the uterus only.\n- Stage II: Cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus.\n- Stage III: Cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix, but has not spread beyond the pelvis.\n- Stage IV: Cancer has spread beyond the pelvis.\n\nEndometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:\n- Low-risk endometrial cancer: Grades 1 and 2 tumors are usually considered low-risk. They usually do not spread to other parts of the body.\n- High-risk endometrial cancer: Grade 3 tumors are considered high-risk. They often spread to other parts of the body. Uterine papillary serous, clear cell, and carcinosarcoma are three subtypes of endometrial cancer that are considered grade 3."

        "context": "Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\nKey Points\nAdult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which\n\t\t  the bone\n\t\t  marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).\nLeukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nPrevious chemotherapy and exposure to radiation may increase the risk of developing ALL.\nSigns and symptoms of adult ALL include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding.\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are\n\t\t  used to diagnose adult ALL.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nAdult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which\n\t\t  the bone\n\t\t  marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).\nAdult\nacute lymphoblastic leukemia\n(ALL; also called acute lymphocytic\n\t\t  leukemia) is a\ncancer\nof the\nblood\nand\nbone marrow\n. This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the bone. The bone is made up of compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Compact bone makes up the outer layer of the bone. Spongy bone is found mostly at the ends of bones and contains red marrow. Bone marrow is found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. There are two types of bone marrow: red and yellow. Red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Yellow marrow is made mostly of fat.\nLeukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nNormally,\n\t\t  the bone marrow makes\nblood stem cells\n(immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a\nmyeloid\nstem cell\nor a\nlymphoid\nstem cell.\nA myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:\nRed blood cells\nthat carry\noxygen\nand other substances to all\n\t\t\t tissues of the body.\nPlatelets\nthat form\nblood clots\nto stop bleeding.\nGranulocytes\n(\nwhite blood cells\n) that fight\ninfection\nand disease.\nA lymphoid stem cell becomes a\nlymphoblast\ncell and then one of three types of\nlymphocytes\n(white blood cells):\nB lymphocytes\nthat make\nantibodies\nto help fight infection.\nT lymphocytes\nthat help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection.\nNatural killer cells\nthat attack cancer cells and\nviruses\n.\nEnlarge\nBlood cell development. A blood stem cell goes through several steps to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell.\nIn ALL, too many stem cells become lymphoblasts, B lymphocytes, or T lymphocytes. These cells are also called\nleukemia\ncells. These leukemia cells are not able to fight infection very well. Also, as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may cause infection,\nanemia\n, and easy bleeding. The cancer can also spread to the\ncentral nervous system\n(brain and\nspinal\n\t\t  cord\n), lymph nodes, spleen, liver, testicles, and other organs.\nPrevious chemotherapy and exposure to radiation may increase the risk of developing ALL.\nAnything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop ALL, and it can develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Possible risk factors for ALL include the following:\nBeing male.\nBeing White.\nBeing older than 70.\nPast treatment with\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\n.\nBeing exposed to high levels of\nradiation\nin the environment (such as nuclear radiation).\nHaving certain\ngenetic\ndisorders\n, such as\nDown syndrome\n.\nSigns and symptoms of adult ALL include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding.\nThe early\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nof ALL may be like the flu or other common diseases.\n\t\t  Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:\nWeakness or feeling tired.\nFever or drenching night sweats.\nEasy bruising or bleeding.\nPetechiae\n(flat, pinpoint spots under the skin, caused by bleeding).\nShortness of breath.\nWeight loss or loss of\nappetite\n.\nPain in the bones or stomach.\nPain or feeling of fullness below the ribs.\nPainless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or\ngroin\n.\nHaving many\ninfections\n.\nThese and other signs and symptoms may be caused by adult acute lymphoblastic\n\t\t  leukemia or by other conditions.\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are\n\t\t  used to diagnose adult ALL.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nComplete blood\n\t\t\t count (CBC) with differential\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and\n\t\t\t checked for the following:\nThe number of red blood cells and platelets.\nThe number and type of white blood cells.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nPeripheral blood smear\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for\nblast\ncells, the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells.\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\n: The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for abnormal cells.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After  a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle is inserted into the patient\u2019s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow   are removed for examination under a microscope.\nThe following tests may be done on the samples of blood or bone marrow tissue that are removed:\nCytogenetic\nanalysis\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. For example, in\nPhiladelphia chromosome\n\u2013positive ALL, part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome.  This is called the \u201cPhiladelphia chromosome.\u201d Cytogenetic analysis is used to help\ndiagnose\ncancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nEnlarge\nThe Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is an abnormal chromosome that is made when pieces of chromosomes 9 and 22 break off and trade places. The\nABL\ngene from chromosome 9 joins to the\nBCR\ngene on chromosome 22 to form the\nBCR\n::\nABL\nfusion gene. The changed chromosome 22 with the fusion gene on it is called the Ph chromosome.\nImmunophenotyping\n:  A laboratory test that uses antibodies to identify cancer cells based on the types of\nantigens\nor\nmarkers\non the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of leukemia. For example, a cytochemistry study may test the cells in a sample of tissue using chemicals (dyes) to look for certain changes in the sample. A chemical may cause a color change in one type of leukemia cell but not in another type of leukemia cell.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe age of the patient.\nWhether the cancer has spread to the brain or spinal cord.\nWhether there are certain changes in the\ngenes\n, including the Philadelphia chromosome.\nWhether the cancer has been treated before or has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nStages of Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\nKey Points\nOnce adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or to other parts of the body.\nThere is no standard staging system for adult ALL.\nOnce adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread is called\nstaging\n.  It is important to know whether the\nleukemia\nhas spread outside the blood and\nbone marrow\nin order to plan treatment.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used to find out if the leukemia has spread:\nChest x-ray\n: An\nx-ray\nof the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nLumbar puncture\n:  A procedure used to collect a sample of\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) from the\nspinal column\n.   This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the\nspine\nand into the CSF around the\nspinal cord\nand removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\nEnlarge\nLumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n:  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of the\nabdomen\n, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nThere is no standard staging system for adult ALL.\nThe disease is described as untreated, in\nremission\n, or\nrecurrent\n.\nUntreated adult ALL\nIn untreated adult ALL, the disease is newly diagnosed. It has not been treated, except to relieve\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\ncaused by the cancer, such as fever, bleeding, or pain, and the following are true:\nThe\ncomplete blood count\n(\nCBC\n) is abnormal.\nMore than 5% of the cells in the\nbone marrow\nare\nblasts\n(\nleukemia\ncells).\nThere are signs and symptoms of leukemia.\nAdult ALL in remission\nIn adult ALL in remission, the disease has been treated, and the following are true:\nThe CBC is normal.\n5% or fewer of the cells in the\nbone marrow\nare\nblasts\n(\nleukemia\ncells).\nThere are no\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nof leukemia other than in the bone marrow.\nRecurrent adult ALL\nRecurrent adult\nALL\nis cancer that has\nrecurred\n(come back) after\n\t\tgoing into\nremission\n. The ALL may come back in the blood,\nbone\n\t\tmarrow\n, or other parts of the body.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with adult\n\t\t  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\nThe treatment of adult ALL usually has two phases.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nTargeted therapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nImmunotherapy\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nTreatment for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia may cause side effects.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with adult\n\t\t  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with adult\nacute lymphoblastic leukemia\n(ALL). Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are\n\t\t  being tested in\nclinical trials\n. A\n\t\t  treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current\n\t\t  treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.\n\t\t  When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nThe treatment of adult ALL usually has two phases.\nThe treatment of adult\nALL\nis done in phases:\nRemission induction therapy\n: This is the first phase of treatment.  The goal is to kill the\nleukemia\ncells\nin the blood and\nbone marrow\n.  This puts the leukemia into\nremission\n.\nPost-remission therapy\n: This is the second phase of treatment.  It begins once the leukemia is in remission.  The goal of post-remission therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a\nrelapse\n. This phase is also called remission continuation therapy.\nTreatment called\ncentral nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis\ntherapy\nis usually given during each phase of therapy.  Because standard\ndoses\nof\nchemotherapy\nmay not reach leukemia cells in the\nCNS\n(brain and\nspinal cord\n), the leukemia cells are able to hide in the CNS.\nSystemic chemotherapy\ngiven in high\ndoses\n,\nintrathecal chemotherapy\n, and\nradiation therapy\nto the brain are able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS. These treatments are given to kill the leukemia cells and lessen the chance  the leukemia will\nrecur\n(come back).\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the\nabdomen\n, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n).\nCombination chemotherapy\nis treatment using more than one anticancer drug.\nIntrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat adult ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord.  When used to lessen the chance leukemia cells will spread to the brain and spinal cord, it is called CNS prophylaxis.\nEnlarge\nIntrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\nfor more information.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nExternal radiation therapy may be used to treat adult ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord.  When used this way, it is called central nervous system (CNS) sanctuary therapy or CNS prophylaxis.\nTotal-body irradiation\nmay  be used to send radiation toward the whole body when preparing for a\nstem cell transplant\n. External radiation therapy may also be used as\npalliative therapy\nto relieve\nsymptoms\nand improve\nquality of life\n.\nChemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nChemotherapy is given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cell transplant is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a\ndonor\nand are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy or total-body radiation therapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\nfor more information.\nEnlarge\nDonor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.\nMonoclonal antibodies\n: Monoclonal antibodies are\nimmune system\nproteins\nmade in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these\nantibodies\ncan attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or\nradioactive\nmaterial directly to cancer cells.\nBlinatumomab\nand\ninotuzumab ozogamicin\nare monoclonal antibodies used with stem cell transplant to treat adult ALL.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body\u2019s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nTyrosine kinase inhibitor\ntherapy: This treatment blocks the\nenzyme\n, tyrosine kinase, that causes stem cells to develop into more\nwhite blood cells\n(\nblasts\n) than the body needs.\nImatinib mesylate\n,\ndasatinib\n, and\nnilotinib\nare tyrosine kinase inhibitors used to treat adult ALL.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\nfor more information.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in\n\t\t  clinical trials.  It may not mention every new treatment being studied.\n\t\t  Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.\nCAR T-cell therapy\n: This treatment changes the patient's\nT cells\n(a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient, and special\nreceptors\nare added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called\nchimeric antigen receptor\n(CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of adult ALL that has recurred (come back).\nEnlarge\nCAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient\u2019s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient\u2019s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nTreatment for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSide effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called\nlate effects\n. Late effects of treatment for ALL may include the risk of\nsecond cancers\n(new types of cancer). Regular\nfollow-up\nexams are very important for long-term\nsurvivors\n.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Untreated Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nStandard treatment\nof adult\nacute lymphoblastic leukemia\n(ALL) during the\nremission induction\nphase includes the following:\nCombination chemotherapy\n.\nTyrosine kinase inhibitor\ntherapy\nwith\nimatinib mesylate\n, in certain patients.

        "context": "Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\nKey Points\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant\n\t\t  (cancer) cells form in the lymph system.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma can be indolent or aggressive.\nOlder age, being male, and having a weakened immune system can increase the risk of\n\t\t  non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nSigns and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, fever,\n\t\t  drenching night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue.\nTests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to  diagnose and stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant\n\t\t  (cancer) cells form in the lymph system.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nis a type of\ncancer\nthat forms in the\nlymph system\n. The lymph system is part of the\nimmune system\n. It helps protect the body from\ninfection\nand disease.\nThe lymph system is made up of the following:\nLymph\n: Colorless, watery\nfluid\nthat travels through the\nlymph vessels\nand carries\nlymphocytes\n(\nwhite blood cells\n). There are three types of lymphocytes:\nB lymphocytes\nthat make\nantibodies\nto help fight infection. Also called B cells. Most types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begin in B lymphocytes.\nT lymphocytes\nthat help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection. Also called T cells.\nNatural killer cells\nthat attack cancer\ncells\nand\nviruses\n. Also called NK cells.\nLymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.\nLymph nodes\n: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are found along a network of lymph vessels throughout the body. Groups of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm,\nmediastinum\n,\nabdomen\n,\npelvis\n, and\ngroin\n.\nSpleen\n: An\norgan\nthat makes lymphocytes, stores\nred blood cells\nand lymphocytes, filters the\nblood\n, and destroys old blood cells. The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the\nstomach\n.\nThymus\n: An organ in which T lymphocytes mature and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the\nbreastbone\n.\nTonsils\n: Two small masses of lymph\ntissue\nat the back of the\nthroat\n. There is one tonsil on each side of the throat.\nBone marrow\n: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of certain bones, such as the hip bone and breastbone. White blood cells, red blood cells, and\nplatelets\nare made in the bone marrow.\nEnlarge\nThe lymph system is part of the body's immune system and is made up of tissues and organs that help protect the body from infection and disease. These include the tonsils, adenoids (not shown), thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes. Lymph tissue is also found in many other parts of the body, including the small intestine.\nLymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the lining of the\ndigestive tract\n,\nbronchus\n, and skin.\nThere are two general types of\nlymphomas\n:\nHodgkin lymphoma\nand non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This summary is about the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults, including during\npregnancy\n.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma can be indolent or aggressive.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma grows and spreads at different rates and can be\nindolent\nor\naggressive\n. Indolent lymphoma tends to grow and spread slowly, and has few\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\n. Aggressive lymphoma grows and spreads quickly, and has signs and symptoms that can be severe. The treatments for indolent and aggressive lymphoma are different.\nThis summary is about the following types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma:\nIndolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas\nFollicular lymphoma\n.\nFollicular lymphoma is the most common type of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is a very slow-growing type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins in B lymphocytes. It  affects the lymph nodes and may spread to the bone marrow or spleen. Most patients with follicular lymphoma are age 50 years and older when they are\ndiagnosed\n. Follicular lymphoma may go away without treatment. The patient is closely watched for signs or symptoms that the disease has come back. Treatment is needed if signs or symptoms occur after the cancer disappeared or after initial cancer treatment. Sometimes follicular lymphoma can become a more aggressive type of lymphoma, such as\ndiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\n.\nLymphoplasmacytic lymphoma\n.\nIn most cases of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma,  B lymphocytes that are turning into\nplasma cells\nmake large amounts of a\nprotein\ncalled\nmonoclonal\nimmunoglobulin\nM (IgM) antibody. High levels of IgM antibody in the blood cause the blood\nplasma\nto thicken. This may cause signs or symptoms such as trouble seeing or hearing, heart problems, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, and numbness or tingling of the hands and feet. Sometimes there are no signs or symptoms of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. It may be found when a\nblood test\nis done for another reason. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma often spreads to the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen. Patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma should be checked for\nhepatitis C virus\ninfection. It is also called Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia.\nMarginal zone lymphoma\n.\nThis type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begins in B lymphocytes in a part of lymph tissue called the marginal zone. The\nprognosis\nmay be worse for patients aged 70 years or older, those with\nstage III\nor\nstage IV\ndisease, and those with  high\nlactate dehydrogenase\n(LDH) levels. There are five different types of marginal zone lymphoma. They are grouped by the type of tissue where the lymphoma formed:\nNodal marginal zone lymphoma.\nNodal marginal zone lymphoma forms in lymph nodes. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is rare. It is also called monocytoid\nB-cell lymphoma\n.\nGastric\nmucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma\n.\nGastric MALT lymphoma usually begins in the stomach. This type of marginal zone lymphoma  forms in cells in the\nmucosa\nthat help make antibodies. Patients with gastric MALT lymphoma may also have\nHelicobacter\ngastritis\nor an\nautoimmune disease\n, such as\nHashimoto thyroiditis\nor\nSj\u00f6gren syndrome\n.\nExtragastric MALT lymphoma.\nExtragastric MALT lymphoma begins outside of the stomach in almost every part of the body including other parts of the\ngastrointestinal tract\n,\nsalivary glands\n,\nthyroid\n, lung, skin, and around the eye. This type of marginal zone lymphoma  forms in cells in the mucosa that help make antibodies. Extragastric MALT lymphoma may come back many years after treatment.\nMediterranean\nabdominal\nlymphoma.\nThis is a type of MALT lymphoma that occurs in young adults in eastern Mediterranean countries. It often forms in the abdomen and patients may also be infected with\nbacteria\ncalled\nCampylobacter jejuni\n. This type of lymphoma is also called immunoproliferative small intestinal disease.\nSplenic\nmarginal zone lymphoma.\nThis type of marginal zone lymphoma begins in the spleen and  may spread to the\nperipheral blood\nand bone marrow. The most common sign of this type of splenic marginal zone lymphoma is a spleen that is larger than normal.\nPrimary\ncutaneous\nanaplastic large cell lymphoma\n.\nThis type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is in the skin only. It can be a\nbenign\n(not cancer)\nnodule\nthat may go away on its own or it can spread to many places on the skin and need treatment.\nAggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It grows quickly in the lymph nodes and often the spleen, liver, bone marrow, or other organs are also affected. Signs and symptoms of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma may include\nfever\n,  drenching night sweats, and weight loss. These are also called B symptoms.\nPrimary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.\nThis type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of\ndiffuse large B-cell  lymphoma\n. It is marked by the overgrowth of\nfibrous\n(scar-like) lymph tissue. A\ntumor\nmost often forms behind the breastbone. It may press on the airways and cause coughing and trouble breathing. Most patients with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma are women who are age 30 to 40  years.\nFollicular large cell lymphoma\n, stage III.\nFollicular large cell lymphoma, stage III,  is a very rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment of this type of follicular lymphoma is more like treatment of aggressive NHL than of indolent NHL.\nAnaplastic large cell lymphoma.\nAnaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually begins in T lymphocytes. The cancer cells also have a\nmarker\ncalled CD30 on the surface of the cell.\nThere are two types of anaplastic large cell lymphoma:\nCutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma.\nThis type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma  mostly affects the skin, but other parts of the body may also be affected. Signs of cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma include one or more bumps or\nulcers\non the skin. This type of lymphoma is rare and indolent.\nSystemic\nanaplastic large cell lymphoma.\nThis type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma begins in the lymph nodes and may affect other parts of the body. This type of lymphoma is more aggressive.  Patients may have a lot of\nanaplastic\nlymphoma\nkinase\n(ALK) protein inside the lymphoma cells. These patients have a better\nprognosis\nthan patients who do not have extra ALK protein. Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma is more common in children than adults. For more information, see\nChildhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment\n.\nExtranodal\nNK\n-/\nT-cell lymphoma\n.\nExtranodal NK-/T-cell lymphoma usually begins in the area around the nose. It may also affect the\nparanasal sinus\n(hollow spaces in the bones around the nose), roof of the mouth,\ntrachea\n, skin, stomach, and\nintestines\n. Most cases of extranodal NK-/T-cell lymphoma have\nEpstein-Barr virus\nin the tumor cells. Sometimes hemophagocytic\nsyndrome\noccurs (a serious\ncondition\nin which there are too many active histiocytes and T cells that cause severe\ninflammation\nin the body). Treatment to suppress the immune system is needed. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is not common in the United States.\nLymphomatoid granulomatosis\n.\nLymphomatoid granulomatosis mostly affects the lungs. It may also affect the paranasal sinuses (hollow spaces in the bones around the nose), skin,\nkidneys\n, and\ncentral nervous system\n. In lymphomatoid granulomatosis, cancer invades the\nblood vessels\nand kills tissue. Because the  cancer may spread to the\nbrain\n,\nintrathecal chemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nto the brain is given.\nAngioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma\n.\nThis type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begins in T cells. Swollen lymph nodes are a common sign. Other signs may include a skin rash, fever, weight loss, or drenching night sweats. There may also be high levels of gamma globulin (antibodies) in the blood. Patients may also have opportunistic infections because their immune systems are weakened.\nPeripheral T-cell lymphoma\n.\nPeripheral T-cell lymphoma begins in mature T lymphocytes. This type of T lymphocyte matures in the thymus\ngland\nand travels to other lymphatic sites in the body such as the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and spleen. There are three subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphoma:\nHepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma.\nThis is an uncommon type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma that occurs mostly in young men. It begins in the liver and spleen and the cancer cells also have a  T-cell\nreceptor\ncalled gamma/delta on the surface of the cell.\nSubcutaneous\npanniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma.\nSubcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma begins in the skin or mucosa. It may occur with hemophagocytic syndrome (a serious condition in which there are too many active histiocytes and T cells that cause severe inflammation in the body). Treatment to suppress the immune system is needed.\nEnteropathy-type\nintestinal\nT-cell lymphoma.\nThis type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma occurs in the small\nbowel\nof patients with untreated\nceliac disease\n(an\nimmune response\nto gluten that causes\nmalnutrition\n). Patients who are diagnosed with celiac disease in childhood and stay on a gluten-free\ndiet\nrarely develop enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphoma.\nIntravascular large B-cell lymphoma.\nThis type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma affects blood vessels, especially the small blood vessels in the brain, kidney, lung, and skin. Signs and symptoms of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma are caused by blocked blood vessels. It is also called intravascular lymphomatosis.\nBurkitt lymphoma\n.\nBurkitt lymphoma is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that grows and spreads very quickly. It may affect the jaw, bones of the face, bowel, kidneys,\novaries\n, or other organs. There are three main types of Burkitt lymphoma (\nendemic\n,\nsporadic\n, and\nimmunodeficiency\nrelated). Endemic Burkitt lymphoma commonly occurs in Africa and is linked to the Epstein-Barr virus, and sporadic Burkitt lymphoma occurs throughout the world. Immunodeficiency-related Burkitt lymphoma is most often seen in patients who have\nAIDS\n. Burkitt lymphoma may spread to the brain and\nspinal cord\nand treatment to\nprevent\nits spread may be given. Burkitt lymphoma occurs most often in children and young adults. For more information, see\nChildhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment\n. Burkitt lymphoma is also called diffuse small noncleaved-cell lymphoma.\nLymphoblastic lymphoma\n.\nLymphoblastic lymphoma may begin in T cells or B cells, but it usually begins  in T cells. In this type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, there are too many\nlymphoblasts\n(immature white blood cells) in the lymph nodes and the thymus gland. These lymphoblasts may spread to other places in the body, such as the bone marrow, brain, and spinal cord. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is most common in teenagers and young adults. It is a lot like\nacute lymphoblastic leukemia\n(lymphoblasts are mostly found in the bone marrow and blood). For more information, see\nAdult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment\n.\nT-cell leukemia/lymphoma\n.\nT-cell leukemia/lymphoma is caused by the\nhuman T-cell leukemia virus type 1\n(HTLV-1). Signs include bone and skin\nlesions\n, high blood\ncalcium\nlevels, and  lymph nodes, spleen, and liver that are larger than normal.\nMantle cell lymphoma\n.\nMantle cell lymphoma is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually occurs in middle-aged or older adults. It begins in the lymph nodes and spreads to the spleen, bone marrow, blood, and sometimes the\nesophagus\n, stomach, and intestines. Patients with mantle cell lymphoma have too much of a protein called\ncyclin-D1\nor a certain\ngene\nchange in the lymphoma cells. In some patients who do not have signs or symptoms of lymphoma, delaying the start of treatment does not affect the prognosis.\nPosttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder\n.\nThis disease occurs in patients who have had a heart, lung, liver, kidney, or\npancreas\ntransplant\nand need lifelong\nimmunosuppressive therapy\n. Most posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders affect the B cells and  have Epstein-Barr virus in the cells. Lymphoproliferative disorders are often treated like cancer.\nTrue\nhistiocytic lymphoma\n.\nThis is a rare, very aggressive type of lymphoma. It is not known  whether it begins in B cells or T cells. It does not respond well to treatment with standard\nchemotherapy\n.\nPrimary effusion lymphoma\n.\nPrimary effusion lymphoma begins in B cells  that are found in an area where there is a large build-up of fluid, such as the areas between the lining of the lung and\nchest wall\n(\npleural effusion\n), the sac around the heart and the heart (\npericardial effusion\n), or in the abdominal\ncavity\n. There is usually no tumor that can be seen. This type of lymphoma often occurs in patients who are infected with\nHIV\n.\nPlasmablastic lymphoma\n.\nPlasmablastic lymphoma is a type of large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is very aggressive. It is most often seen in patients with HIV infection.\nOlder age, being male, and having a weakened immune system can increase the risk of\n\t\t  non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nAnything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and it can develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.\nThese and other risk factors may increase the risk of certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma:\nBeing older, male, or White.\nHaving one of the following medical conditions that weakens the immune system:\nAn\ninherited\nimmune\ndisorder\n(such as\nhypogammaglobulinemia\nor\nWiskott-Aldrich syndrome\n).\nAn autoimmune disease (such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n,\npsoriasis\n, or Sj\u00f6gren syndrome).\nHIV/AIDS.\nHuman T-lymphotrophic virus type I or Epstein-Barr virus infection.\nHelicobacter pylori\ninfection.\nTaking\nimmunosuppressant\ndrugs\nafter an organ transplant.\nSigns and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, fever,\n\t\t  drenching night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue.\nThese signs and symptoms may be caused by non-Hodgkin\n\t\t  lymphoma or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the\n\t\t  following:\nSwelling in the lymph nodes in the neck, underarm,\n\t\t\t  groin, or stomach.\nFever for no known reason.\nDrenching night sweats.\nFeeling very tired.\nWeight loss for no known reason.\nSkin rash or itchy skin.\nPain in the chest, abdomen, or bones for no known reason.\nWhen fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss occur together, this group of symptoms is called B symptoms.\nOther signs and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma may occur and depend on the following:\nWhere the cancer forms in the body.\nThe size of the tumor.\nHow fast the tumor grows.\nTests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to  diagnose and stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\n: A  procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the protein that carries\noxygen\n) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by\n\t\t\t organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign\n\t\t\t of disease.\nLDH\ntest\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount  of lactic dehydrogenase. An increased amount of LDH in the blood may be a sign of tissue damage, lymphoma, or other diseases.\nHepatitis B\nand\nhepatitis C\ntest\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked to measure the amounts of hepatitis B virus-specific\nantigens\nand/or antibodies and the amounts of hepatitis C virus-specific antibodies. These antigens or antibodies are called markers. Different markers or combinations of markers are used to determine whether a patient has a hepatitis B or C infection, has had a prior infection or\nvaccination\n, or is susceptible to infection. Patients who have been treated for hepatitis B virus in the past need continued\nmonitoring\nto check if it has\nreactivated\n. Knowing whether a person has hepatitis B or C may help plan treatment.\nHIV test\n: A test to measure the level of HIV antibodies in a sample of blood.  Antibodies are made by the body when it is invaded by a\nforeign\nsubstance. A high level of HIV antibodies may mean the body has been infected with HIV.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n:\n\t\t  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and lymph nodes, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nPET scan\n(positron\n\t\t  emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor cells in the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\n: The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow and bone under a\nmicroscope\nto look for signs of cancer.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After  a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle is inserted into the patient\u2019s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow   are removed for examination under a microscope.\nLymph node biopsy\n: The\n\t\t\t removal of all or part of a  lymph node. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells. One of the following  types of biopsies  may be done:\nExcisional\n\t\t\t\t  biopsy\n: The removal of an entire lymph node.\nIncisional\n\t\t\t\t  biopsy\n: The removal of part of a lymph node.\nCore biopsy\n:  The removal of part of a lymph node using a wide needle.\nIf cancer is found, the following tests may be done to study the cancer cells:\nImmunohistochemistry\n:  A\nlaboratory test\nthat uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of a patient\u2019s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A laboratory test in which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nImmunophenotyping\n: A laboratory test that uses antibodies to identify cancer cells based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of lymphoma.\nFISH\n(fluorescence in situ hybridization)\n: A laboratory test used to look at and count genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of\nDNA\nthat contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient\u2019s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.\nOther tests and procedures may be done depending on the signs and symptoms seen and where the cancer forms in the body.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe prognosis and treatment options depend on the following:\nThe patient's signs and symptoms, including whether or not they have B symptoms (fever for no known reason, weight loss for no known reason, or drenching  night sweats).\nThe\nstage\nof the cancer (the size of the cancer tumors and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body or lymph nodes).\nThe type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nThe amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the blood.\nWhether there are certain changes in the genes.\nThe patient\u2019s age, sex, and\n\t\t  general health.\nWhether the lymphoma is newly diagnosed, continues to grow during treatment, or has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nFor non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy, treatment options also depend on:\nThe wishes of the patient.\nWhich trimester of pregnancy the patient is in.\nWhether the baby can be delivered early.\nSome types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma spread more quickly than\n\t\t  others do. Most non-Hodgkin lymphomas that occur during pregnancy are\n\t\t  aggressive. Delaying treatment\n\t\t  of aggressive lymphoma until after the baby is born may lessen the mother's chance of survival. Immediate\n\t\t  treatment is often recommended, even during pregnancy.\nStages of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\nKey Points\nAfter non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out\n\t\t  whether cancer cells have spread within the lymph\n\t\t  system or to other parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nThe following stages are used for non-Hodgkin\n\t\t  lymphoma:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nNon-Hodgkin lymphomas may be grouped for treatment according to whether the cancer is indolent or aggressive, whether affected lymph nodes are next to each other in the body, and whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or recurrent.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma  can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nAfter non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out\n\t\t  whether cancer cells have spread within the lymph\n\t\t  system or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out the type of\ncancer\nand if cancer\ncells\nhave spread within the\nlymph system\nor to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The\n\t\t  information gathered from the staging process determines the\nstage\nof the\n\t\t  disease. It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. The results of the\ntests and procedures\ndone to\ndiagnose\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nare used to help make decisions about treatment.\nThe following tests and procedures may also be used in the staging\n\t\t  process:\nMRI\n(magnetic\n\t\t  resonance imaging) with\ngadolinium\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\nbrain\nand\nspinal cord\n. A substance called gadolinium is\ninjected\ninto the patient through a\nvein\n. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nLumbar puncture\n: A procedure used to collect\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) from the\nspinal column\n. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the\nspine\nand into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\nEnlarge\nLumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.\nFor\npregnant\nwomen with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, staging tests and procedures that protect the\nfetus\nfrom the harms of\nradiation\nare used. These tests and procedures include MRI (without contrast), lumbar puncture, and\nultrasound\n.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for non-Hodgkin\n\t\t  lymphoma:\nStage I\nEnlarge\nStage I adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in one or more lymph nodes in a group of lymph nodes or, in rare cases, cancer is found in the Waldeyer\u2019s ring, thymus, or spleen. In stage IE (not shown), cancer has spread to one area outside the lymph system.\nStage I non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nis divided into stages I and IE.\nIn stage I,\ncancer\nis found in one of the following places in the\nlymph system\n:\nOne or more\nlymph nodes\nin a group of lymph nodes.\nWaldeyer's ring\n.\nThymus\n.\nSpleen\n.\nIn stage IE, cancer is found in one area outside the lymph system.\nStage II\nStage II non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nis divided into stages II and IIE.\nIn stage II,\ncancer\nis found in two or more groups of\nlymph nodes\nthat are either above the\ndiaphragm\nor below the diaphragm.\nEnlarge\nStage II adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are either above the diaphragm or below the diaphragm.\nIn stage IIE, cancer has spread from a group of lymph nodes to a nearby area that is outside the\nlymph system\n. Cancer may have spread to other lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm.\nEnlarge\nStage IIE adult lymphoma. Cancer has spread from a group of lymph nodes to a nearby area that is outside the lymph system. Cancer may have spread to other lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm.\nIn stage II, the term\nbulky disease\nrefers to a larger\ntumor\nmass. The size of the tumor mass that is referred to as bulky disease varies based on the type of\nlymphoma\n.\nStage III\nEnlarge\nStage III adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in groups of lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm; or in a group of lymph nodes above the diaphragm and in the spleen.\nIn\nstage III non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n,\ncancer\nis found:\nin groups of\nlymph nodes\nboth above and below the\ndiaphragm\n; or\nin lymph nodes above the diaphragm and in the\nspleen\n.\nStage IV\nEnlarge\nStage IV adult lymphoma. Cancer (a) has spread throughout one or more organs outside the lymph system; or (b) is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are either above the diaphragm or below the diaphragm and in one organ that is outside the lymph system and not near the affected lymph nodes; or (c) is found in groups of lymph nodes above the diaphragm and below the diaphragm and in any organ that is outside the lymph system; or (d) is found in the liver, bone marrow, more than one place in the lung, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The cancer has not spread directly into the liver, bone marrow, lung, or CSF from nearby lymph nodes.\nIn\nstage IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n,\ncancer\n:\nhas spread throughout one or more\norgans\noutside the\nlymph system\n; or\nis found in two or more groups of\nlymph nodes\nthat are either above the\ndiaphragm\nor below the diaphragm and in one organ that is outside the lymph system and not near the affected lymph nodes; or\nis found in groups of lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm and in any organ that is outside the lymph system; or\nis found in the\nliver\n,\nbone marrow\n, more than one place in the\nlung\n, or\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF). The cancer has not spread directly into the liver, bone marrow, lung, or CSF from nearby lymph nodes.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphomas may be grouped for treatment according to whether the cancer is indolent or aggressive, whether affected lymph nodes are next to each other in the body, and whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or recurrent.\nFor more information on the types of\nindolent\n(slow-growing) and\naggressive\n(fast-growing) non-Hodgkin lymphoma, see the\nGeneral Information\nsection.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma can also be described as\ncontiguous\nor\nnoncontiguous\n:\nContiguous lymphomas:\nLymphomas\nin which the\nlymph nodes\nwith cancer are next\n\t\t  to each other.\nNoncontiguous lymphomas: Lymphomas in which the lymph nodes with cancer\n\t\t  are not next to each other, but are on the same side of the\ndiaphragm\n.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma  can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nThe lymphoma may come back\n\t\tin the lymph system or in other parts of the body. Indolent lymphoma may come back as\n\t\taggressive lymphoma. Aggressive\n\t\tlymphoma may come back as indolent lymphoma.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nPatients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment\n\t\t  planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating lymphomas.\nTreatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma may cause side effects.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nTargeted therapy\nPlasmapheresis\nWatchful waiting\nAntibiotic therapy\nSurgery\nStem cell transplant\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nVaccine therapy\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some\n\t\t  are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.\n\t\t  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help\n\t\t  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients\n\t\t  with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nFor\npregnant\nwomen with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment is carefully chosen to protect the\nfetus\n. Treatment decisions are based on the mother\u2019s wishes, the\nstage\nof the non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and the trimester of the pregnancy. The treatment plan may change as the\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\n, cancer, and pregnancy change. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.\nPatients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment\n\t\t  planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating lymphomas.\nTreatment will be overseen by a\nmedical\n\t\t  oncologist\n, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer, or a\nhematologist\n, a doctor who specializes in treating\nblood cancers\n. The\n\t\t  medical oncologist may refer you to other\nhealth care providers\nwho have experience and\n\t\t  are experts in treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain\n\t\t  areas of\nmedicine\n. These may include the following\nspecialists\n:\nNeurosurgeon\n.\nNeurologist\n.\nRadiation\n\t\t\t oncologist\n.\nEndocrinologist\n.\nRehabilitation specialist\n.\nFertility specialist\n.\nOther\noncology\nspecialists.\nTreatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSide effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called\nlate effects\n. Treatment with\nchemotherapy\n,\nradiation therapy\n, or\nstem cell transplant\nfor non-Hodgkin lymphoma may increase the risk of  late effects.\nLate effects of cancer treatment may include the following:\nHeart problems.\nInfertility\n(inability to have children).\nLoss of\nbone density\n.\nNeuropathy\n(\nnerve\ndamage that causes numbness or trouble walking).\nA\nsecond cancer\n, such as:\nLung cancer\n.\nBrain cancer.\nKidney cancer\n.\nBladder cancer\n.\nMelanoma\n.\nHodgkin lymphoma\n.\nMyelodysplastic syndrome\n.\nAcute myeloid leukemia\n.\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your doctor about the effects cancer treatment can have on you. Regular\nfollow-up\nto check for late effects is important.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer\ncells\nor keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Sometimes\ntotal-body irradiation\nis given before a\nstem cell transplant\n.\nProton beam radiation therapy\nis a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of\nprotons\n(tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill\ntumor\ncells. This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy\ntissue\nnear a tumor such as the heart or\nbreast\n.\nExternal radiation therapy is used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and may also be used as\npalliative therapy\nto relieve symptoms and improve\nquality of life\n.\nFor a pregnant woman with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, radiation therapy should be given after delivery, if possible, to avoid any risk to the fetus. If treatment is needed right away, the woman  may decide to continue the pregnancy and receive radiation therapy. A\nlead shield\nis used to cover the pregnant woman's\nabdomen\nto help protect the fetus from radiation as much as possible.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(\nintrathecal chemotherapy\n), an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n).\nCombination chemotherapy\nis treatment using two or more anticancer drugs.\nSteroid drugs\nmay be added, to lessen\ninflammation\nand lower the body's\nimmune response\n.\nSystemic combination chemotherapy is used for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nIntrathecal chemotherapy may also be used in the treatment of\nlymphoma\nthat first forms in the\ntesticles\nor\nsinuses\n(hollow areas) around the nose,\ndiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\n,\nBurkitt lymphoma\n,\nlymphoblastic lymphoma\n, and some\naggressive\nT-cell lymphomas\n. It is given  to lessen the chance that lymphoma cells will spread to the brain and\nspinal cord\n. This is called\nCNS prophylaxis\n.\nEnlarge\nIntrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.\nWhen a pregnant woman is treated with chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the fetus cannot be protected from being exposed to chemotherapy. Some chemotherapy regimens may cause birth defects if given in the first trimester.\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient\u2019s\nimmune system\nto fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body\u2019s natural defenses against cancer.\nImmunomodulators\n:\nLenalidomide\nis an immunomodulator used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nCAR T-cell therapy: The patient's\nT cells\n(a type of immune system cell) are changed so they will attack certain\nproteins\non the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special\nreceptors\nare added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called\nchimeric antigen receptor\n(CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by\ninfusion\n. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's\nblood\nand attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy (such as\naxicabtagene ciloleucel\nor\ntisagenlecleucel\n) is used to  treat large\nB-cell lymphoma\nthat has not\nresponded\nto treatment. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied  to treat\nmantle cell lymphoma\nthat has\nrelapsed\nor not responded to treatment.\nEnlarge\nCAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient\u2019s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient\u2019s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\n.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.\nMonoclonal\n\t\t\t\tantibody\ntherapy\n,\nproteasome inhibitor\ntherapy, and\nkinase inhibitor\ntherapy are types of targeted therapy used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nMonoclonal\n\t\t\t\tantibody therapy: Monoclonal antibodies are\nimmune system\nproteins made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer.  As a cancer treatment, these\nantibodies\ncan attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow.  The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading.  Monoclonal antibodies are given by\ninfusion\n.  They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or\nradioactive\nmaterial directly to cancer cells.\nTypes of monoclonal antibodies include:\nRituximab\n, used to treat many types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nObinutuzumab\n, used to treat\nfollicular lymphoma\n.\nMogamulizumab\n, used to treat certain types of\nrelapsed\nor\nrefractory\nT-cell lymphoma\n.\nTafasitamab\ncombined with  lenalidomide to treat relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\nPembrolizumab\nto treat\nprimary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma\n.\nPolatuzumab vedotin\n, combined with\nbendamustine\nand rituximab to treat relapsed or refractory\ndiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\n.\nBrentuximab vedotin\n, which contains a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called\nCD30\nthat is found on some lymphoma cells. It also contains an anticancer drug that may help kill cancer cells.\nYttrium Y 90-ibritumomab tiuxetan\n,  an example of a\nradiolabeled\nmonoclonal antibody.\nMosunetuzumab\n, which is a\nbispecific monoclonal antibody\nthat helps the body's immune system recognize and kill cancer cells. It is used to treat relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body\u2019s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nProteasome inhibitor therapy: This treatment blocks the action of proteasomes in cancer cells. Proteasomes remove\nproteins\nno longer needed by the cell. When the proteasomes are blocked, the proteins build up in the cell and may cause the cancer cell to die.\nBortezomib\nor\nixazomib\nis used to decrease how much\nimmunoglobulin\nM is in the blood after cancer treatment for\nlymphoplasmacytic lymphoma\n(Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia). It is also being studied to treat\nrelapsed\nmantle cell lymphoma\n.\nKinase inhibitor therapy: This treatment  blocks certain proteins, which may help keep lymphoma cells from growing and may kill them. Kinase inhibitor therapies include:\nIbrutinib\n,\nacalabrutinib\n, and\nzanubrutinib\n, which are types of Bruton\ntyrosine kinase inhibitor\ntherapy. They are used to treat mantle cell lymphoma. Ibrutinib and acalabrutinib are also used to treat lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and zanubrutinib is being studied to treat it.\nHistone methyltransferase inhibitor\ntherapy:\nTazemetostat\nis used to treat follicular lymphoma that has come back or has not gotten better with other treatment. It is used in adults whose cancer has a certain\nmutation\n(change) in the\nEZH2 gene\nthat has already been treated with at least two other anticancer therapies.\nB-cell lymphoma-2\n(BCL-2) inhibitor therapy:\nVenetoclax\nmay be used to treat mantle cell lymphoma. It blocks the action of a protein called  BCL-2 and  may help kill cancer cells.\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\n.\nPlasmapheresis\nIf the blood becomes thick with extra antibody proteins and affects\ncirculation\n,\nplasmapheresis\nis done to remove extra\nplasma\nand antibody proteins from the blood. In this procedure, blood is removed from the patient and sent through a  machine that separates the plasma (the liquid part of the blood) from the blood cells. The patient's plasma contains the unneeded antibodies and is not returned to the patient. The normal blood cells are returned to the bloodstream along with\ndonated\nplasma or a plasma  replacement. Plasmapheresis does not keep new antibodies from forming.\nWatchful waiting\nWatchful waiting\nis\n\t\t\t closely\nmonitoring\na patient\u2019s\ncondition\nwithout giving any treatment until\n\t\t\t signs or symptoms appear or change.\nAntibiotic therapy\nAntibiotic\ntherapy is a treatment that uses drugs to treat\ninfections\nand cancer caused by\nbacteria\nand other\nmicroorganisms\n.\nSurgery\nSurgery\nmay be used to remove the lymphoma in certain patients with\nindolent\nor\naggressive\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nThe type of surgery used depends on where the lymphoma formed in the body:\nLocal\nexcision\nfor certain patients with\nmucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma\n, PTLD, and small bowel T-cell lymphoma.\nSplenectomy\nfor patients with\nmarginal zone lymphoma\nof the\nspleen\n.\nPatients who have a heart,\nlung\n,\nliver\n,\nkidney\n, or\npancreas\ntransplant\nusually need to take drugs to suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives. Long-term\nimmunosuppression\nafter an organ transplant can cause a certain type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma called\nposttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder\n(PLTD).\nSmall\nbowel\nsurgery is often needed to\ndiagnose\nceliac disease\nin adults who develop a type of T-cell lymphoma.\nStem cell transplant\nStem cell transplant is a method of giving high\ndoses\nof chemotherapy and/or total-body irradiation and then replacing blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient (\nautologous transplant\n) or a\ndonor\n(\nallogeneic transplant\n) and are frozen and stored.  After the chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.  These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body\u2019s blood cells.\nEnlarge\nDonor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in\n\t\t  clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied.\n\t\t  Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nVaccine therapy\nVaccine therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses a substance or group of substances to stimulate the immune system to find the\ntumor\nand kill it.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nindolent\nstage I\nand indolent,\ncontiguous\nstage II\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nmay include\n\t\t  the following:\nRadiation therapy\n.\nMonoclonal antibody\ntherapy\n(\nrituximab\n) and/or\nchemotherapy\n.\nWatchful waiting\n.\nIf the\ntumor\nis too large to be treated with radiation therapy, the treatment options for indolent,\nnoncontiguous\nstage II\n,\nIII\n, or\nIV\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma will be used.\nTreatment of indolent, noncontiguous stage II, III, or IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma may include the following:\nWatchful waiting for patients who do not have\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\n.\nMonoclonal\n\t\t\t antibody therapy (rituximab) with or without chemotherapy.\nLenalidomide\nand rituximab.\nMaintenance therapy\nwith rituximab.\nMonoclonal antibody therapy (\nobinutuzumab\n) with or without chemotherapy.\nEZH2\ninhibitor therapy (\ntazemetostat\n).\nRadiolabeled\nmonoclonal antibody\n\t\t\t therapy.\nA\nclinical trial\nof\nhigh-dose chemotherapy\nwith or without\ntotal-body irradiation\nor radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy, followed by\nautologous\nor\nallogeneic  stem cell transplant\n.\nA clinical trial of chemotherapy with or without\nvaccine therapy\n.\nA clinical trial of new types of monoclonal antibodies.\nA clinical trial of radiation therapy that includes nearby\nlymph nodes\n, for patients who have stage III disease.\nA clinical trial of\nlow-dose radiation therapy\n, to relieve symptoms and improve\nquality of life\n.\nOther treatments for indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma depend on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

        "question": "What are the treatments for Chronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms ?",
        "right_answer": "Key Points\n                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.    - Eleven types of standard treatment are used:          - Watchful waiting     -  Phlebotomy      -  Platelet apheresis      - Transfusion therapy     -  Chemotherapy      -  Radiation therapy      - Other drug therapy     -  Surgery      - Biologic therapy      - Targeted therapy     - High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant        - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.    - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.\n                \n                \n                    There are different types of treatment for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\n                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\n                \n                \n                    Eleven types of standard treatment are used:\n                    Watchful waiting     Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.        Phlebotomy      Phlebotomy is a procedure in which blood is taken from a vein. A sample of blood may be taken for tests such as a CBC or blood chemistry. Sometimes phlebotomy is used as a treatment and blood is taken from the body to remove extra red blood cells. Phlebotomy is used in this way to treat some chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.         Platelet apheresis      Platelet apheresis is a treatment that uses a special machine to remove platelets from the blood. Blood is taken from the patient and put through a blood cell separator where the platelets are removed. The rest of the blood is then returned to the patients bloodstream.       Transfusion therapy     Transfusion therapy (blood transfusion) is a method of giving red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets to replace blood cells destroyed by disease or cancer treatment.        Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms for more information.        Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, and is usually directed at the spleen.       Other drug therapy     Prednisone and danazol are drugs that may be used to treat anemia in patients with primary myelofibrosis.     Anagrelide therapy is used to reduce the risk of blood clots in patients who have too many platelets in their blood. Low-dose aspirin may also be used to reduce the risk of blood clots.     Thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide are drugs that prevent blood vessels from growing into areas of tumor cells.     See Drugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms for more information.        Surgery      Splenectomy (surgery to remove the spleen) may be done if the spleen is enlarged.        Biologic therapy      Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer or other diseases. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against disease. This type of treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. Interferon alfa and pegylated interferon alpha are biologic agents commonly used to treat some chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.      Erythropoietic growth factors are also biologic agents. They are used to stimulate the bone marrow to make red blood cells.        Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow.      Ruxolitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat certain types of myelofibrosis.    See Drugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms for more information.    Other types of targeted therapies are being studied in clinical trials.       High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\n                \n                \n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\n                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.\n                \n                \n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\n                \n                \n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.\n                \n                \n                    Follow-up tests may be needed.\n                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.\n                \n                \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            Treatment Options for Chronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    See the PDQ summary about Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment for information.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    Polycythemia Vera\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    The purpose of treatment for polycythemia vera is to reduce the number of extra blood cells.

        "context": "Chronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Chronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\nKey Points\nMyeloproliferative neoplasms are a group of diseases in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets.\nThere are 6 types of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nMyeloproliferative neoplasms are a group of diseases in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets.\nNormally, the\nbone marrow\nmakes\nblood stem cells\n(immature\ncells\n) that become mature\nblood\ncells over time.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the bone. The bone is made up of compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Compact bone makes up the outer layer of the bone. Spongy bone is found mostly at the ends of bones and contains red marrow. Bone marrow is found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. There are two types of bone marrow: red and yellow. Red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Yellow marrow is made mostly of fat.\nA blood stem cell may become a\nmyeloid\nstem cell\nor a\nlymphoid\nstem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a\nwhite blood cell\n. A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:\nRed blood cells\nthat carry\noxygen\nand other substances to all\ntissues\nof the body.\nGranulocytes\n, which are white blood cells that help fight\ninfection\nand disease.\nPlatelets\nthat form\nblood clots\nto stop bleeding.\nEnlarge\nBlood cell development. A blood stem cell goes through several steps to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell.\nIn\nmyeloproliferative neoplasms\n,  too many blood stem cells become one or more types of  blood cells. The neoplasms usually get worse slowly as the number of extra blood cells increases.\nThere are 6 types of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nThe type of  myeloproliferative neoplasm is based on whether too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are being made.  Sometimes the body will make too many of more than one type of blood cell, but usually one type of blood cell is affected more than the others are.\nChronic myeloproliferative neoplasms\ninclude the following 6 types:\nChronic myelogenous leukemia\n.\nPolycythemia vera\n.\nPrimary myelofibrosis\n(also called chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis).\nEssential thrombocythemia\n.\nChronic neutrophilic leukemia\n.\nChronic eosinophilic leukemia\n.\nThese types are described below.  Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms sometimes become\nacute leukemia\n, in which too many\nabnormal\nwhite blood cells are made.\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n:  An exam of the body to check general\nsigns\nof health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient\u2019s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nComplete blood count (CBC) with differential\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of red blood cells and platelets.\nThe number and type of white blood cells.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nPeripheral blood smear\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for the following:\nWhether there are  red blood cells shaped like teardrops.\nThe number and kinds of white blood cells.\nThe number of platelets.\nWhether there are\nblast\ncells.\nBlood chemistry studies\n:  A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by\norgans\nand tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy\n: The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a\nmicroscope\nto look for abnormal cells.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After  a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle is inserted into the patient\u2019s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow   are removed for examination under a microscope.\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of bone marrow or blood are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of\ncancer\n. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help\ndiagnose\ncancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nGene\nmutation\ntest\n:  A laboratory test done on a bone marrow or blood sample to check for mutations in\nJAK2\n,\nMPL\n, or\nCALR\ngenes. A\nJAK2\ngene mutation is often found in patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, or primary myelofibrosis.\nMPL\nor\nCALR\ngene mutations are found in patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis.\nChronic Myelogenous Leukemia\nChronic myelogenous leukemia\nis a disease in which too many\nwhite blood cells\nare made in the\nbone marrow\n. See the\nPDQ\nsummary on\nChronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment\nfor information on\ndiagnosis\n,\nstaging\n, and treatment.\nPolycythemia Vera\nKey Points\nPolycythemia vera is a disease in which too many red blood cells are made in the bone marrow.\nSymptoms of polycythemia vera include headaches and a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side.\nSpecial blood tests are used to diagnose polycythemia vera.\nPolycythemia vera is a disease in which too many red blood cells are made in the bone marrow.\nIn\npolycythemia vera\n, the\nblood\nbecomes thickened with too many\nred blood cells\n. The number of\nwhite blood cells\nand\nplatelets\nmay also increase. These extra blood\ncells\nmay collect in the\nspleen\nand cause it to swell.  The increased number of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets in the blood can cause bleeding problems and make clots form in\nblood vessels\n. This can increase the risk of\nstroke\nor heart attack.  In patients who are older than 65 years or who have a\nhistory\nof\nblood clots\n, the risk of stroke or heart attack  is higher. Patients also have an increased risk of\nacute myeloid leukemia\nor\nprimary myelofibrosis\n.\nSymptoms of polycythemia vera include headaches and a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side.\nPolycythemia vera often does not cause early\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\n. It may be found during a routine\nblood test\n. Signs and symptoms may occur as the number of blood cells increases. Other\nconditions\nmay cause the same signs and symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nA feeling of pressure or fullness below the ribs on the left side.\nHeadaches.\nDouble vision or seeing dark or blind spots that come and go.\nItching all over the body, especially after being in warm or hot water.\nReddened face that looks like a blush or sunburn.\nWeakness.\nDizziness.\nWeight loss for no known reason.\nSpecial blood tests are used to diagnose polycythemia vera.\nIn addition to a\ncomplete blood count\n,\nbone marrow aspiration and biopsy\n, and\ncytogenetic analysis\n, a\nserum\nerythropoietin\ntest is used to\ndiagnose\npolycythemia vera. In this test, a sample of blood is checked for the level of erythropoietin (a\nhormone\nthat stimulates new red blood cells to be made). In polycythemia vera, the erythropoietin level would be lower than normal because the body does not need to make more red blood cells.\nPrimary Myelofibrosis\nKey Points\nPrimary myelofibrosis is a disease in which abnormal blood cells and fibers build up inside the bone marrow.\nSymptoms of primary myelofibrosis include pain below the ribs on the left side and feeling very tired.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for  primary myelofibrosis.\nPrimary myelofibrosis is a disease in which abnormal blood cells and fibers build up inside the bone marrow.\nThe\nbone marrow\nis made of\ntissues\nthat make\nblood\ncells\n(\nred blood cells\n,\nwhite blood cells\n, and\nplatelets\n) and a web of fibers that support the blood-forming tissues.  In\nprimary myelofibrosis\n(also called chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), large numbers of\nblood stem cells\nbecome blood cells that do not mature properly (\nblasts\n). The web of fibers inside the bone marrow also becomes very thick (like\nscar tissue\n) and slows the blood-forming tissue\u2019s ability to make blood cells.  This causes the blood-forming tissues to make fewer and fewer blood cells.  In order to make up for the low number of blood cells made in the bone marrow, the\nliver\nand\nspleen\nbegin to make the blood cells.\nSymptoms of primary myelofibrosis include pain below the ribs on the left side and feeling very tired.\nPrimary myelofibrosis often does not cause early\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\n. It may be found during a routine\nblood test\n. Signs and symptoms may be caused by primary myelofibrosis or by other\nconditions\n. Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nFeeling pain or fullness below the ribs on the left side.\nFeeling full sooner than normal when eating.\nFeeling very tired.\nShortness of breath.\nEasy bruising or bleeding.\nPetechiae\n(flat, red, pinpoint spots under the skin that are caused by bleeding).\nFever\n.\nDrenching night sweats.\nWeight loss.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for  primary myelofibrosis.\nPrognosis\ndepends on the following:\nThe age of the patient.\nThe number of\nabnormal\nred blood cells and white blood cells.\nThe number of blasts in the blood.\nWhether there are certain changes in the\nchromosomes\n.\nWhether the patient has signs such as fever, drenching night sweats, or weight loss.\nEssential Thrombocythemia\nKey Points\nEssential thrombocythemia is a disease in which too many platelets are made in the bone marrow.\nPatients with essential thrombocythemia may have no signs or symptoms.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for essential thrombocythemia.\nEssential thrombocythemia is a disease in which too many platelets are made in the bone marrow.\nEssential thrombocythemia\ncauses an\nabnormal\nincrease in the number of\nplatelets\nmade in the\nblood\nand\nbone marrow\n.\nPatients with essential thrombocythemia may have no signs or symptoms.\nEssential thrombocythemia often does not cause early\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\n. It may be found during a routine\nblood test\n. Signs and symptoms may be caused by essential thrombocythemia or by other\nconditions\n.  Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nHeadache.\nBurning or tingling in the hands or feet.\nRedness and warmth of the hands or feet.\nVision or hearing problems.\nPlatelets are sticky. When there are too many platelets, they may clump together and make it hard for the blood to flow.  Clots may form in\nblood vessels\nand there may also be increased bleeding. These can cause serious health problems such as\nstroke\nor heart attack.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for essential thrombocythemia.\nPrognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe age of the patient.\nWhether the patient has signs or symptoms or other problems related to essential thrombocythemia.\nChronic Neutrophilic Leukemia\nChronic neutrophilic leukemia\nis a disease in which too many\nblood stem cells\nbecome a type of\nwhite blood cell\ncalled\nneutrophils\n. Neutrophils are\ninfection\n-fighting\nblood\ncells\nthat surround and destroy dead cells and\nforeign\nsubstances (such as\nbacteria\n). The\nspleen\nand\nliver\nmay swell because of the extra neutrophils. Chronic neutrophilic leukemia may stay the same or it may\nprogress\nquickly to\nacute leukemia\n.\nChronic Eosinophilic Leukemia\nKey Points\nChronic eosinophilic leukemia is a disease in which  too many white blood cells (eosinophils) are made in the bone marrow.\nSigns and symptoms of chronic eosinophilic leukemia include fever and feeling very tired.\nChronic eosinophilic leukemia is a disease in which  too many white blood cells (eosinophils) are made in the bone marrow.\nEosinophils\nare\nwhite blood cells\nthat react to allergens (substances that cause an\nallergic response\n) and help fight\ninfections\ncaused by certain\nparasites\n. In\nchronic eosinophilic leukemia\n, there are too many eosinophils in the\nblood\n,\nbone marrow\n, and other\ntissues\n. Chronic eosinophilic leukemia may stay the same for many years or it may\nprogress\nquickly to\nacute leukemia\n.\nSigns and symptoms of chronic eosinophilic leukemia include fever and feeling very tired.\nChronic eosinophilic leukemia may not cause early\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\n. It may be found during a routine\nblood test\n. Signs and symptoms may be caused by chronic eosinophilic leukemia or by other\nconditions\n. Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nFever\n.\nFeeling very tired.\nCough.\nSwelling under the skin around the eyes and lips, in the\nthroat\n, or on the hands and feet.\nMuscle pain.\nItching.\nDiarrhea\n.\nStages of Chronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\nKey Points\nThere is no standard staging system for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nThere is no standard staging system for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. There is no standard\nstaging system\nfor\nchronic myeloproliferative neoplasms\n.  It\n\t\t  is important to know the type of myeloproliferative neoplasm in order to plan treatment.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nEleven types of standard treatment are used:\nWatchful waiting\nPhlebotomy\nPlatelet apheresis\nTransfusion therapy\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nOther drug therapy\nSurgery\nImmunotherapy\nTargeted therapy\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for patients with\nchronic myeloproliferative neoplasms\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nEleven types of standard treatment are used:\nWatchful waiting\nWatchful waiting\nis closely\nmonitoring\na patient\u2019s\ncondition\nwithout giving any treatment until\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nappear or change.\nPhlebotomy\nPhlebotomy\nis a procedure in which\nblood\nis taken from a\nvein\n. A sample of blood may be taken  for tests such as a\nCBC\nor\nblood chemistry\n. Sometimes phlebotomy is used as a treatment and blood is taken from the body to remove extra\nred blood cells\n. Phlebotomy is used in this way to treat some chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nPlatelet apheresis\nPlatelet\napheresis\nis a treatment that uses a special machine to remove platelets from the blood. Blood is taken from the patient and put through a blood\ncell\nseparator where the platelets are removed. The rest of the blood is then returned to the patient\u2019s bloodstream.\nTransfusion therapy\nTransfusion\ntherapy\n(\nblood transfusion\n) is a method of giving red blood cells,\nwhite blood cells\n, or platelets to replace blood cells destroyed by disease or\ncancer\ntreatment.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them  from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\nfor more information.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body, such as the\nspleen\n, with cancer.\nOther drug therapy\nPrednisone\nand\ndanazol\nare drugs that may be used to treat\nanemia\nin patients with\nprimary myelofibrosis\n.\nAnagrelide\ntherapy is used to reduce the risk of\nblood clots\nin patients who have too many platelets in \ntheir blood. Low-\ndose\naspirin\nmay also be used to reduce the risk of blood clots.\nThalidomide\n,\nlenalidomide\n, and\npomalidomide\nare drugs that prevent\nblood vessels\nfrom growing into areas of\ntumor\ncells.\nErythropoietic\ngrowth factors\nare used to stimulate the\nbone marrow\nto make red blood cells.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\nfor more information.\nSurgery\nSplenectomy\n(\nsurgery\nto remove the spleen) may be done if the spleen is enlarged.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient's\nimmune system\nto fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.  This cancer treatment is a type of\nbiologic therapy\n.\nInterferon: Interferon affects the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth.\nInterferon alfa\nand\npegylated interferon alpha\nare commonly used to treat certain chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.\nTyrosine kinase inhibitor\n(TKI) therapy: TKI therapy blocks signals that cancer cells need to grow.\nRuxolitinib\nis used to treat\npolycythemia vera\nand certain types of\nmyelofibrosis\n.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\nfor more information.\nOther types of targeted therapies are being studied in clinical trials.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nHigh doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell transplant\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a\ndonor\nand are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nEnlarge\nDonor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nInformation about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia\nSee the\nPDQ\nsummary about\nChronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment\nfor information.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of blood disorders characterized by bone marrow that produces too many white blood cells, red blood cells, or platelets. The three main types of MPNs are chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia. Other less common forms include chronic neutrophilic leukemia and chronic eosinophilic leukemia. Treatment options for these conditions depend on the specific type of MPN and the patient's symptoms. For example, treatment for CML may involve targeted therapy drugs like imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib. Polycythemia vera is often treated with phlebotomy, chemotherapy, biologic therapy using interferon alfa or pegylated interferon alpha, and low-dose aspirin. Primary myelofibrosis may be treated with targeted therapy drugs like ruxolitinib, chemotherapy, donor stem cell transplant, thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide, splenectomy, or radiation therapy to the spleen and other areas outside the bone marrow. Essential thrombocythemia may be treated with chemotherapy, anagrelide therapy, biologic therapy using interferon alfa or pegylated interferon alpha, and platelet apheresis. Chronic neutrophilic leukemia treatment options include donor bone marrow transplant, chemotherapy, and biologic therapy using interferon alfa. Treatment for chronic eosinophilic leukemia may involve bone marrow transplant, biologic therapy using interferon alfa, or participation in a clinical trial of a new treatment. Patients with these conditions are encouraged to discuss their treatment options with their healthcare providers and consider participating in clinical trials when appropriate."

        "context": "Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma\nKey Points\nChildhood rhabdomyosarcoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in muscle tissue.\nCertain genetic conditions increase the risk of  childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.\nA sign of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is a lump or swelling that keeps getting bigger.\nDiagnostic tests and a biopsy are used to diagnose childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nChildhood rhabdomyosarcoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in muscle tissue.\nRhabdomyosarcoma\nis a type of\nsarcoma\n. Sarcoma is\ncancer\nof\nsoft tissue\n(such as muscle),\nconnective tissue\n(such as\ntendon\nor\ncartilage\n), or bone. Rhabdomyosarcoma usually begins in muscles that are attached to  bones and that help the body move, but it may begin in many places in the body. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children.\nThere are four main types of rhabdomyosarcoma:\nEmbryonal\n: This type occurs most often  in the head and neck area or  in the\ngenital\nor\nurinary\norgans\n, but can occur anywhere in the body. It is the most common type of rhabdomyosarcoma.\nAlveolar\n: This type occurs most often in the arms or legs, chest,\nabdomen\n, genital organs, or\nanal\narea.\nSpindle cell\n/sclerosing: The spindle cell type occurs most often in the paratesticular (\ntestis\nor\nspermatic cord\n) area. There are two other spindle cell/sclerosing subtypes. One is more common in infants and is found in the\ntrunk\narea. The other can affect children,\nadolescents\n, and adults. It is often found in the head and neck area, and is more\naggressive\n.\nPleomorphic\n: This is the least common type of rhabdomyosarcoma in children.\nSee the following\nPDQ\ntreatment summaries for information about other types of soft tissue sarcoma:\nSoft Tissue Sarcoma\nChildhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma\nCertain genetic conditions increase the risk of  childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.\nAnything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn\u2019t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child\u2019s doctor if you think your child may be at risk.\nRisk factors for rhabdomyosarcoma include having the following\ninherited\ndiseases:\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome\n.\nDicer1 syndrome\n.\nNeurofibromatosis type 1\n(NF1).\nCostello syndrome\n.\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome\n.\nNoonan syndrome\n.\nChildren who had a high birth weight or were larger than expected at birth may have an increased risk of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.\nIn most cases, the cause of rhabdomyosarcoma is not known.\nA sign of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is a lump or swelling that keeps getting bigger.\nSigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by childhood rhabdomyosarcoma or by other\nconditions\n. The signs and symptoms that occur depend on where the cancer forms. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:\nA lump or swelling that keeps getting bigger or does not go away. It may be painful.\nCrossed-eyes or bulging of the eye.\nHeadache.\nTrouble\nurinating\nor having\nbowel\nmovements.\nBlood\nin the urine.\nBleeding in the nose,\nthroat\n,\nvagina\n, or\nrectum\n.\nDiagnostic tests and a biopsy are used to diagnose childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.\nThe\ndiagnostic tests\nthat are done depend in part on where the cancer forms. The following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient\u2019s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nX-ray\n: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the body, such as the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen,\npelvis\n, or\nlymph nodes\n, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or\ntissues\nshow up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nEnlarge\nComputed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the\nskull\n,\nbrain\n, and lymph nodes. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nEnlarge\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor\ncells\nin the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive glucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where\nglucose\nis being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nEnlarge\nPositron emission tomography (PET) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the PET scanner. The head rest and white strap help the child lie still.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the child's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body.  Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nBone scan\n: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of\nradioactive\nmaterial is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.\nEnlarge\nBone scan.  A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the child's vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive material collects in the bones. As the child lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen.\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\n: The removal of\nbone marrow\n, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone. Samples are removed from both hipbones. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a\nmicroscope\nto look for signs of cancer.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child\u2019s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.\nLumbar puncture\n: A procedure used to collect\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) from the\nspinal column\n. This is done by placing a needle     between two bones in the\nspine\nand into the CSF around the\nspinal cord\nand removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer cells. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\nIf these tests show there may be a rhabdomyosarcoma, a biopsy is done. A biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed   under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Because treatment depends on the type of rhabdomyosarcoma,\nbiopsy samples\nshould be checked by a pathologist who has experience in\ndiagnosing\nrhabdomyosarcoma.\nOne of the following types of biopsies may be used:\nFine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy\n: The removal of tissue or\nfluid\nusing a thin needle.\nCore needle biopsy\n: The removal of tissue using a wide needle. This procedure may be guided using\nultrasound\n, CT scan, or MRI.\nOpen biopsy\n: The removal of tissue through an\nincision\n(cut) made in the skin.\nSentinel lymph node biopsy\n:  The removal of the\nsentinel lymph node\nduring\nsurgery\n. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node in a group of lymph nodes to receive\nlymphatic drainage\nfrom the\nprimary tumor\n. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor.  A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor.  The substance or dye flows through the\nlymph\nducts\nto the lymph nodes.  The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed.   A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.  If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy may be used for patients with rhabdomyosarcoma of the limbs or\ntrunk\nwhen enlarged lymph nodes are not found with  imaging or physical exam.\nThe following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:\nLight\nmicroscopy\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.\nImmunohistochemistry\n: A laboratory test that uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient\u2019s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nFISH\n(fluorescence in situ hybridization)\n: A laboratory test used to look at and count\ngenes\nor\nchromosomes\nin cells and tissues. Pieces of\nDNA\nthat contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient\u2019s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.\nReverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction\n(RT\u2013PCR) test\n: A laboratory test in which the amount of a\ngenetic\nsubstance called\nmRNA\nmade by a specific gene is measured. An enzyme called reverse transcriptase is used to convert a specific piece of\nRNA\ninto a matching piece of DNA, which can be amplified (made in large numbers) by another enzyme called DNA polymerase. The amplified DNA copies help tell whether a specific mRNA is being made by a gene. RT\u2013PCR can be used to check the activation of certain genes that may indicate the presence of cancer cells. This test may be used to look for certain changes in a gene or chromosome, which may help diagnose cancer.\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A laboratory test in which the chromosomes of cells in a sample of tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe patient's age.\nWhere in the body the\ntumor\nstarted.\nThe size of the tumor  at the time of diagnosis.\nWhether the tumor has been completely removed by surgery.\nThe type of rhabdomyosarcoma (\nembryonal\n,\nalveolar\n,\nspindle cell\n/sclerosing, or\npleomorphic\n).\nWhether there are certain changes in the genes.\nWhether the tumor had spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis.\nWhether the tumor was in the lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis.\nWhether the tumor\nresponds\nto\nchemotherapy\nand/or\nradiation therapy\n.\nFor patients with\nrecurrent cancer\n, prognosis and treatment also depend on the following:\nWhere in the body the tumor recurred (came back).\nHow much time passed between the end of cancer treatment and when the cancer\nrecurred\n.\nWhether the cancer was previously treated with radiation therapy.\nStages of Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma\nKey Points\nAfter childhood rhabdomyosarcoma has been diagnosed, treatment is based in part on the stage of the cancer and sometimes it is based on whether all the cancer was removed by surgery.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nStaging of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is done in   three parts.\nThe  staging system is based on the size of the tumor, where it is in the body,  and whether it has spread to other parts of the body:\nStage 1\nStage 2\nStage 3\nStage 4\nThe grouping system is   based on whether the cancer has spread and whether all the cancer was removed by surgery:\nGroup I\nGroup II\nGroup III\nGroup IV\nThe risk group is based on the staging system  and the grouping system.\nLow-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma\nIntermediate-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma\nHigh-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma\nSometimes childhood rhabdomyosarcoma continues to grow or comes back after treatment.\nAfter childhood rhabdomyosarcoma has been diagnosed, treatment is based in part on the stage of the cancer and sometimes it is based on whether all the cancer was removed by surgery.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread within the\ntissue\nor to other\nparts of the body is called\nstaging\n. It is important to know the\nstage\nin order to plan treatment. The doctor will use results of the\ndiagnostic tests\nto help find out the stage of the disease.\nTreatment for childhood\nrhabdomyosarcoma\nis based in part on the stage and sometimes on the amount of cancer that remains after\nsurgery\nto remove the\ntumor\n. The\npathologist\nwill use a\nmicroscope\nto check the tissues removed during surgery, including tissue samples from the edges of the areas where the cancer was removed and the\nlymph nodes\n. This is done to see if all the cancer\ncells\nwere taken out during the surgery.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  rhabdomyosarcoma spreads to the\nlung\n, the cancer cells in the lung are actually rhabdomyosarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma, not lung cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nStaging of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is done in   three parts.\nChildhood rhabdomyosarcoma  is staged by using three different ways to describe the cancer:\nA\nstaging system\n.\nA grouping system.\nA\nrisk group\n.\nThe  staging system is based on the size of the tumor, where it is in the body,  and whether it has spread to other parts of the body:\nStage 1\nIn\nstage\n1, the tumor is any size, may have spread to\nlymph nodes\n, and is found  in only one of the following \"favorable\" sites:\nEye or area around the eye.\nHead and neck (but not in the\ntissue\nnear the ear, nose,\nsinuses\n, base of the\nskull\n,\nbrain\n, or\nspinal cord\n).\nGallbladder\nand\nbile ducts\n.\nUreters\nor\nurethra\n.\nTestes\n,\novary\n,\nvagina\n, or\nuterus\n.\nRhabdomyosarcoma\nthat forms in a \"favorable\" site has a better\nprognosis\n. If the site where cancer occurs is not one of the favorable sites listed above, it is said to be an \"unfavorable\" site.\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).\nStage 2\nIn\nstage\n2,\ncancer\nis found in an \"unfavorable\" site (any one area not described as \"favorable\" in stage 1). The\ntumor\nis  no larger than 5\ncentimeters\nand has not spread to\nlymph nodes\n.\nStage 3\nIn\nstage\n3,\ncancer\nis found in an \"unfavorable\" site (any one area not described as \"favorable\" in stage 1) and one of the following is true:\nThe\ntumor\nis no larger than 5\ncentimeters\nand cancer has spread to nearby\nlymph nodes\n.\nThe tumor is larger than 5 centimeters and cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nStage 4\nIn\nstage\n4, the\ntumor\nmay be any size and\ncancer\nmay have spread to nearby\nlymph nodes\n. Cancer has spread to\ndistant\nparts of  the body, such as the\nlung\n,\nbone marrow\n, or bone.\nThe grouping system is   based on whether the cancer has spread and whether all the cancer was removed by surgery:\nGroup I\nCancer\nwas found only in the place where it started and it was completely removed by\nsurgery\n.\nTissue\nwas taken from the edges of where the\ntumor\nwas removed.  This tissue was checked under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nand no cancer\ncells\nwere found.\nGroup II\nGroup II is divided into groups IIA, IIB, and IIC.\nIIA:\nCancer\nwas removed by\nsurgery\nbut cancer\ncells\nwere seen when the\ntissue\n, taken from the edges of where the\ntumor\nwas removed, was viewed under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\n.\nIIB: Cancer had spread to  nearby\nlymph nodes\nand the cancer and lymph nodes were removed by surgery.\nIIC: Cancer had spread to  nearby lymph nodes, the cancer and lymph nodes were removed by surgery, and at least one of the following is true:\nTissue taken from the edges of where the tumor was removed was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and cancer cells were seen.\nThe furthest lymph node from the tumor that was removed was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and cancer cells were seen.\nGroup III\nCancer\nwas partly removed by\nbiopsy\nor\nsurgery\nbut there is\ntumor\nremaining that can be seen with the eye.\nGroup IV\nCancer\nhad spread to\ndistant\nparts of the body when the cancer was\ndiagnosed\n.\nCancer cells are found by an\nimaging test\n; or\nThere are cancer cells in the\nfluid\naround the\nbrain\n,\nspinal cord\n, or\nlungs\n, or in fluid in the\nabdomen\n; or\ntumors\nare found in those areas.\nThe risk group is based on the staging system  and the grouping system.\nThe risk group describes the chance that rhabdomyosarcoma will\nrecur\n(come back). Every child  treated for  rhabdomyosarcoma should receive\nchemotherapy\nto decrease the chance cancer will recur. The type of anticancer drug,\ndose\n,  and the number of treatments given depends on whether the child has low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma.\nThe following risk groups are used:\nLow-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma\nLow-risk childhood\nrhabdomyosarcoma\nis one of the following:\nAn\nembryonal tumor\nof any size that is  found in a \"favorable\" site. There may be\ntumor\nremaining after\nsurgery\nthat can be seen with or without a\nmicroscope\n. The\ncancer\nmay have spread to nearby\nlymph nodes\n.    The following areas are \"favorable\" sites:\nEye or area around the eye.\nHead or neck (but not in the\ntissue\nnear the ear, nose,\nsinuses\n, base of the\nskull\n,\nbrain\n, or\nspinal cord\n).\nGallbladder\nand\nbile ducts\n.\nUreter\nor\nurethra\n.\nTestes\n,\novary\n,\nvagina\n, or\nuterus\n.\nAn embryonal tumor of any size   that is   not found in a \"favorable\" site. There may be  tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen only with a microscope. The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nIntermediate-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma\nIntermediate-risk childhood\nrhabdomyosarcoma\nis one of the following:\nAn\nembryonal tumor\nof any size  that is not found in one of the \"favorable\" sites listed above.  There is\ntumor\nremaining after\nsurgery\n, that can be seen with or without a\nmicroscope\n. The\ncancer\nmay have spread  to nearby\nlymph nodes\n.\nAn\nalveolar\ntumor of any size in  a \"favorable\" or \"unfavorable\" site.  There may be tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen with or without a microscope.  The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nHigh-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma\nHigh-risk childhood\nrhabdomyosarcoma\nmay be the\nembryonal\ntype or the\nalveolar\ntype. It may have spread to nearby\nlymph nodes\nand has spread to one or more of the following:\nOther parts of the body that are not near where the\ntumor\nfirst formed.\nFluid\naround the brain or\nspinal cord\n.\nFluid in the\nlung\nor\nabdomen\n.\nSometimes childhood rhabdomyosarcoma continues to grow or comes back after treatment.\nProgressive\nrhabdomyosarcoma\nis\ncancer\nthat continues to grow, spread, or get worse. Progressive disease may be a\nsign\nthat the cancer has become\nrefractory\nto treatment.\nRecurrent\nchildhood rhabdomyosarcoma is cancer that has\nrecurred\n(come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the same place or in other parts of the body, such as the\nlung\n, bone, or\nbone marrow\n. Less often, rhabdomyosarcoma may come back in the\nbreast\nin\nadolescent\nfemales or in the\nliver\n.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.\nChildren with rhabdomyosarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nThree types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nImmunotherapy\nTargeted therapy\nTreatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.\nSome treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.\nBecause cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.\nChildren with rhabdomyosarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nBecause\nrhabdomyosarcoma\ncan form in  many different parts of the body, many different kinds of treatments are used. Treatment will be overseen by a\npediatric oncologist\n, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer.  The pediatric oncologist works with  other\nhealth care providers\nwho are experts in treating children with rhabdomyosarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of\nmedicine\n.    These may include the following\nspecialists\n:\nPediatrician\n.\nPediatric surgeon\n.\nRadiation oncologist\n.\nPediatric hematologist\n.\nPediatric\nradiologist\n.\nPediatric nurse specialist\n.\nGeneticist\nor cancer\ngenetics risk counselor\n.\nSocial worker\n.\nRehabilitation specialist\n.\nThree types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery\n(removing the cancer in an operation) is used  to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma. A type of surgery called\nwide local excision\nis often done.  A wide local excision is the removal of\ntumor\nand some of the\ntissue\naround it, including  the\nlymph nodes\n. A second surgery may be needed to remove all the cancer. Whether surgery is done and the type of surgery done depends on the following:\nWhere in the body the tumor started.\nThe effect the surgery will have on the way the child will look.\nThe effect the surgery will have on the child's important body functions.\nHow the tumor\nresponded\nto\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nthat may have been given first.\nIn most children with rhabdomyosarcoma, it is not possible to remove all of the tumor by surgery.\nRhabdomyosarcoma can form in many different places in the body and the surgery will be different for each site.  Surgery to treat  rhabdomyosarcoma of the eye or\ngenital\nareas is usually a\nbiopsy\n.    Chemotherapy, and sometimes radiation therapy, may be given before surgery to  shrink large tumors.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, patients will  be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer\ncells\nthat are left. Radiation therapy may also be given. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.  There are two types of radiation therapy:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:\nConformal radiation therapy\n: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a\n3-dimensional\n(3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high\ndose\nof radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.\nIntensity-modulated radiation therapy\n(IMRT): IMRT is a type of\n3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy\nthat uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.\nVolumetrical modulated arc therapy (VMAT): VMAT is type of 3-D radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. The radiation machine moves in a circle around the patient once during treatment and sends thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) at the tumor. Treatment with VMAT is delivered faster than treatment with IMRT.\nStereotactic body radiation therapy\n: Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue.  This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.\nProton beam radiation therapy\n: Proton-beam therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy. A radiation therapy machine aims streams of\nprotons\n(tiny, invisible, positively-charged particles) at the cancer cells to kill them. This type of treatment may cause less damage to nearby healthy tissue.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer. It is used to treat cancer in areas such as  the\nvagina\n,\nvulva\n,\nuterus\n,\nbladder\n,\nprostate\n, head, or neck. Internal radiation therapy is also called brachytherapy, internal radiation, implant radiation, or interstitial radiation therapy. This approach involves special technical skills and is offered in only a few medical centers.\nThe type and amount of radiation therapy and when it is given depends on the age of the child, the type of rhabdomyosarcoma, where in the body the tumor started, how much tumor remained after surgery, and whether there is tumor in the nearby lymph nodes.\nExternal radiation therapy is usually used to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma but in certain cases internal radiation therapy is used.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nChemotherapy may also be given to shrink the tumor before surgery in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible. This is called\nneoadjuvant\nchemotherapy.\nEvery child  treated for  rhabdomyosarcoma should receive systemic chemotherapy to decrease the chance the cancer will recur. The type of anticancer drug, dose,  and the number of treatments given depends on the age of the child and whether the child has low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Rhabdomyosarcoma\nfor more information.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient\u2019s\nimmune system\nto fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body\u2019s natural defenses against cancer.  This cancer treatment is a type of\nbiologic therapy\n. There are different types of immunotherapy:\nVaccine therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses a substance or group of substances to stimulate the immune system to find the tumor and kill it. Vaccine therapy is being studied to treat\nmetastatic\nrhabdomyosarcoma.\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor\ntherapy uses the body's immune system to kill cancer cells. Two types of immune checkpoint inhibitors are being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back after treatment:\nCTLA-4\nis a protein on the surface of\nT cells\nthat helps keep the body\u2019s\nimmune responses\nin check. When CTLA-4 attaches to another\nprotein\ncalled B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. CTLA-4 inhibitors attach to CTLA-4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells.\nIpilimumab\nis being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back or\nprogressed\nduring treatment.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as B7-1/B7-2 on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and CTLA-4 on T cells, help keep the body\u2019s immune responses in check. When the T-cell receptor (TCR) binds to antigen and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the APC and CD28 binds to B7-1/B7-2 on the APC, the T cell can be activated. However, the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 keeps the T cells in the inactive state so they are not able to kill tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) allows the T cells to be active and to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nPD-1\nand\nPD-L1\ninhibitor therapy: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body\u2019s immune responses in check. PD-L1 is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other. This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells.\nNivolumab\nand\npembrolizumab\nare types of PD-1 inhibitors that are being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back or progressed during treatment.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nImmunotherapy uses the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a                type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. There are different types of targeted therapy:\nmTOR inhibitors\nstop the protein that helps cells divide and survive.\nSirolimus\nis a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy being studied in the treatment of\nrecurrent\nrhabdomyosarcoma.\nTyrosine kinase inhibitors\nblock signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide. MK-1775,\ncabozantinib-s-malate\n, and\npalbociclib\nare tyrosine kinase inhibitors being studied in the treatment of newly\ndiagnosed\nor recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.\nTreatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSide effects\nfrom cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called\nlate effects\n. Late effects of cancer treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma may include:\nPhysical problems that affect the following:\nTeeth, eye, or\ngastrointestinal\nfunction.\nFertility\n(ability to have children).\nChanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.\nSecond cancers\n(new types of cancer).\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your  child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child and the types of\nsymptoms\nto expect after cancer treatment has ended. (See the\nPDQ\nsummary on\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\nfor more information.)\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma\nThe treatment of newly diagnosed childhood\nrhabdomyosarcoma\noften includes\nsurgery\n,\nradiation therapy\n, and\nchemotherapy\n. The order that these treatments are given depends on where in the body the\ntumor\nstarted, the size of the tumor, the type of tumor, and whether the tumor has spread to\nlymph nodes\nor other parts of the body. See the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection of this summary for more information about surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy used to treat children with rhabdomyosarcoma.\nRhabdomyosarcoma of the brain and head and neck\nFor\ntumors\nof the\nbrain\n: Treatment may include\nsurgery\nto remove the tumor,\nradiation therapy\n, and\nchemotherapy\n.\nFor tumors of the head and neck that are in or near the eye: Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. If the tumor remains or comes back after treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, surgery to remove the eye and some\ntissues\naround the eye may be needed.\nFor tumors of the head and neck that are near the ear, nose,\nsinuses\n, or base of the\nskull\nbut not in or near the eye: Treatment may include radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\nFor tumors of the head and neck that are not in or near the eye and not near the ear, nose, sinuses, or base of the skull: Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery to remove the tumor.\nFor tumors of the head and neck that cannot be removed by surgery: Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy including\nstereotactic body radiation therapy\n.\nFor tumors of the\nlarynx\n(voice box): Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Surgery to remove the larynx is usually not done, so that the voice is not harmed.\nRhabdomyosarcoma of the arms or legs\nChemotherapy\nfollowed by\nsurgery\nto remove the\ntumor\n. If the tumor was not completely removed, a\nsecond surgery\nto remove the tumor may be done.\nRadiation therapy\nmay also be given.\nFor tumors of the hand or foot, radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be given. The tumor may not be removed because it would affect the function of the hand or foot.\nLymph node dissection\n(one or more\nlymph nodes\nare removed and a sample of\ntissue\nis checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor\nsigns\nof\ncancer\n).\nFor tumors in the arms, lymph nodes near the tumor and in the armpit area are removed.\nFor tumors in the legs, lymph nodes near the tumor and in the\ngroin\narea are removed.\nRhabdomyosarcoma of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis\nFor\ntumors\nin the chest or\nabdomen\n(including the\nchest wall\nor\nabdominal\nwall):\nSurgery\n(\nwide local excision\n) may be done. If the tumor is large,\nchemotherapy\nand\nradiation therapy\nare given to shrink the tumor before surgery.\nFor tumors of the\npelvis\n: Surgery (wide local excision) may be done. If the tumor is large, chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumor before surgery.

Surgery may be done later to remove any remaining cancer cells.\nFor tumors of the muscles or tissues around the\nanus\nor between the\nvulva\nand the anus or the\nscrotum\nand the anus: Surgery may be done to remove as much of the tumor as possible and some nearby\nlymph nodes\n, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\nRhabdomyosarcoma of the kidney\nFor\ntumors\nof the\nkidney\n:\nSurgery\nto remove as much of the\ntumor\nas possible.\nChemotherapy\nand\nradiation therapy\nmay also be given.\nRhabdomyosarcoma of the bladder or prostate\nFor\ntumors\nthat are only at the top of the\nbladder\n:\nSurgery\n(\nwide local excision\n) is done.\nFor tumors of the\nprostate\nor bladder (other than the top of the bladder):\nChemotherapy\nand\nradiation therapy\nare given first to shrink the tumor. If\ncancer\ncells\nremain after chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the tumor is removed by surgery.  Surgery may include removal of the prostate, part of the bladder, or\npelvic exenteration\nwithout removal of the\nrectum\n. (This may include removal of the lower\ncolon\nand bladder. In girls, the\ncervix\n,\nvagina\n,\novaries\n, and nearby\nlymph nodes\nmay be removed).\nChemotherapy is given first to shrink the tumor.

UV radiation is the name for the invisible rays that are part of the energy that comes from the sun. Sunlamps and tanning beds also give off UV radiation.   Risk factors for nonmelanoma and melanoma cancers are not the same.         -  Risk factors for nonmelanoma skin cancer:                  - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.       - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                         - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.         - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.          - Red or blond hair.                       - Having actinic keratosis.        - Past treatment with radiation.       - Having a weakened immune system.       - Being exposed to arsenic.                -  Risk factors for melanoma skin cancer:                  - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                         - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.          - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.         - Red or blond hair.                      - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.       - Having a history of many blistering sunburns, especially as a child or teenager.       - Having several large or many small moles.       - Having a family history of unusual moles (atypical nevus syndrome).       - Having a family or personal history of melanoma.        - Being white.\n                \n                \n                    It is not known if the following lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer:\n                    Sunscreen use and avoiding sun exposure    It is not known if nonmelanoma skin cancer risk is decreased by staying out of the sun, using sunscreens, or wearing protective clothing when outdoors. This is because not enough studies have been done to prove this.    Sunscreen may help decrease the amount of UV radiation to the skin. One study found that wearing sunscreen can help prevent actinic keratoses, scaly patches of skin that sometimes become squamous cell carcinoma.     The harms of using sunscreen are likely to be small and include allergic reactions to skin creams and lower levels of vitamin D made in the skin because of less sun exposure.     It is also possible that when a person uses sunscreen to avoid sunburn they may spend too much time in the sun and be exposed to harmful UV radiation.    Although protecting the skin and eyes from the sun has not been proven to lower the chance of getting skin cancer, skin experts suggest the following:            -  Use sunscreen that protects against UV radiation.     -  Do not stay out in the sun for long periods of time, especially when the sun is at its strongest.     -  Wear long sleeve shirts, long pants, sun hats, and sunglasses, when outdoors.              Chemopreventive agents     Chemoprevention is the use of drugs, vitamins, or other agents to try to reduce the risk of cancer. The following chemopreventive agents have been studied to find whether they lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer:         Beta carotene      Studies of beta carotene (taken as a supplement in pills) have not shown that it prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back.            Isotretinoin      High doses of isotretinoin have been shown to prevent new skin cancers in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum. However, isotretinoin has not been shown to prevent nonmelanoma skin cancers from coming back in patients previously treated for nonmelanoma skin cancers. Treatment with isotretinoin can cause serious side effects.            Selenium      Studies have shown that selenium (taken in brewer's yeast tablets) does not lower the risk of basal cell carcinoma, and may increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma.            Celecoxib      A study of celecoxib in patients with actinic keratosis and a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer found those who took celecoxib had slightly lower rates of recurrent nonmelanoma skin cancers. Celecoxib may have serious side effects on the heart and blood vessels.             Alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)      A study of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in patients with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer showed that those who took DFMO had lower rates of nonmelanoma skin cancers coming back than those who took a placebo. DFMO may cause hearing loss which is usually temporary.            Nicotinamide (vitamin B3)      Studies have shown that nicotinamide (vitamin B3) helps prevent new actinic keratoses lesions from forming in people who had four or fewer actinic lesions before taking nicotinamide. More studies are needed to find out if nicotinamide prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back.\n                \n                \n                    It is not known if the following lower the risk of melanoma:\n                    Sunscreen    It has not been proven that using sunscreen to prevent sunburn can protect against melanoma caused by UV radiation. Other risk factors such as having skin that burns easily, having a large number of benign moles, or having atypical nevi may also play a role in whether melanoma forms.       Counseling and protecting the skin from the sun    It is not known if people who receive counseling or information about avoiding sun exposure make changes in their behavior to protect their skin from the sun.\n                \n                \n                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.\n                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.   The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer.

        "context": "Skin Cancer Prevention (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nWhat is prevention?\nCancer prevention is action taken to lower the chance of getting \n         cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer \n         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower \n         the number of deaths caused by cancer.\nTo prevent new cancers from starting, scientists look at risk factors and protective factors. Anything that increases your \n         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; \n         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is \n         called a cancer protective factor.\nSome risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. \n         For example, both smoking and inheriting certain\ngenes\nare \n         risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be \n         avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy\ndiet\nmay be protective \n         factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and \n         increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does \n         not mean that you will not get cancer.\nDifferent ways to prevent cancer are being studied.\nGeneral Information About Skin Cancer\nKey Points\nSkin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form\n\t\t  in the tissues of the skin.\nThere are several types of skin cancer.\nSkin cancer is the most common cancer in the United\n\t\t  States.\nSkin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form\n\t\t  in the tissues of the skin.\nThe skin is the body\u2019s largest organ. It protects against heat, sunlight, injury, and\ninfection\n. Skin also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and\nvitamin D\n. The skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the epidermis (upper or outer layer) and the dermis (lower or inner layer).\nThe epidermis is made up of three kinds of cells:\nSquamous cells\nare\n\t\t\t the thin, flat cells that make up most of the epidermis.\nBasal cells\nare\n\t\t\t the round cells under the squamous cells.\nMelanocytes\nare\n\t\t\t found throughout the lower part of the epidermis. They make\nmelanin\n, the\n\t\t\t pigment that gives skin its natural color. When skin is exposed to the sun,\n\t\t\t melanocytes make more pigment, causing the skin to tan, or darken.\nThe dermis contains blood and\nlymph\n\t\t  vessels\n,\nhair follicles\n, and\nglands\n.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the skin, showing the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue.

Squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma are also called keratinocyte carcinoma or\nnonmelanoma skin cancers\n. Melanoma, which forms in the melanocytes, is  a less common type of skin\n\t\t  cancer that grows and spreads quickly.\nSkin cancer can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common in areas exposed to sunlight, such as the face, neck, hands, and arms.\nSkin cancer is the most common cancer in the United\n\t\t  States.\nBasal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the most common types of skin cancer in the United States. The number of new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer appears to be increasing every year. These nonmelanoma\n\t\t  skin cancers can usually be\ncured\n.\nThe number of new cases of melanoma has been increasing for at least 40 years.  Melanoma is more likely to spread to nearby tissues and other parts of the body and can be harder to cure.

It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Radiosensitizers     Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers helps kill more tumor cells.       Sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by surgery     Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes.

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\n                \n                \n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.",
        "context": "Penile Cancer Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Penile Cancer\nKey Points\nPenile cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the tissues of the penis.\nHuman papillomavirus infection may increase the risk of developing penile cancer.\nSigns of penile cancer include sores, discharge, and bleeding.\nTests that examine the penis are used to diagnose penile cancer.\nAfter penile cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the penis or to other parts of the body.\nSome people decide to get a second opinion.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nPenile cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the tissues of the penis.\nThe penis is a rod-shaped male\nreproductive\norgan that passes\nsperm\nand\nurine\nfrom the body. It contains two types  of erectile tissue (spongy tissue with\nblood vessels\nthat fill with blood to make an erection):\nCorpora cavernosa\nare the two columns of erectile tissue that form most of the penis.\nCorpus spongiosum\nis the single column of erectile tissue that forms a small portion of the penis. The corpus spongiosum surrounds the urethra (the tube through which urine and sperm pass from the body).\nThe erectile tissue is wrapped in\nconnective tissue\nand covered with skin. The glans (head of the penis) is covered with loose skin called the\nforeskin\n.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the penis. The parts of the penis are the base, shaft, glans, and foreskin. The tissues that make up the penis include the dorsal nerve, blood vessels, connective tissue, and erectile tissue (corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum). The urethra passes from the bladder to the tip of the penis.\nHuman papillomavirus infection may increase the risk of developing penile cancer.\nA risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors for penile cancer, like smoking, can be changed. However, risk factors also include things you cannot change, like your genetics, getting older, and your\nfamily history\n. Learning about risk factors for penile cancer can help you make changes that might lower your risk of getting it.\nRisk factors for penile cancer \n         include:\nBeing uncircumcised. Circumcision may help prevent\ninfection\nwith the\nhuman papillomavirus\n(HPV). A circumcision is an operation in which the doctor removes part or all of the foreskin from the penis. Many boys are circumcised shortly after birth. Men who were not circumcised at birth may have a higher risk of developing penile cancer.\nBeing 60 years or older.\nHaving phimosis (a condition in which the foreskin of the penis cannot be pulled back over the glans).\nHaving poor personal\nhygiene\n.\nHaving many sexual partners.\nUsing tobacco products.\nSigns of penile cancer include sores, discharge, and bleeding.\nThese and other\nsigns\nmay be caused by penile cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have:\nredness, irritation, or a sore on the penis\na lump on the penis\nTests that examine the penis are used to diagnose penile cancer.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nPhysical exam of the penis\nis an exam in which the doctor checks the penis for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual.\nBiopsy\nis the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. The tissue sample is removed during one of the following procedures:\nIncisional biopsy\nis the removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue that doesn't look normal.\nExcisional biopsy\nis the removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesn\u2019t look normal.\nAfter penile cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the penis or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if cancer has spread within the penis or to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\nuses a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\npelvis\n. The pictures are taken from different angles and are used to create 3-D views of tissues and organs. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\nuses a small amount of radioactive sugar (also called glucose) that is injected into a vein. Then a scanner rotates around the body to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. Because cancer cells often take up more glucose than normal cells, the pictures can be used to find cancer cells in the body. When this procedure is done at the same time as a CT scan, it is called a\nPET/CT scan\n.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\nis a procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called\ngadolinium\nis injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nUltrasound\nexam\nis a procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n.\nChest x-ray\nis an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nBiopsy\nis the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. The tissue sample is removed during one of the following procedures:\nSentinel lymph node biopsy\nis the removal of the\nsentinel lymph node\nduring surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first\nlymph node\nin a group of lymph nodes to receive\nlymphatic drainage\nfrom the\nprimary tumor\n. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor.  A\nradioactive\nsubstance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor.  The substance or dye flows through the\nlymph\nducts\nto the lymph nodes.  The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed.   A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.  If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes.\nLymph node dissection\nis a procedure to remove one or more lymph nodes in the\ngroin\nduring surgery. A sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called a lymphadenectomy.\nSome people decide to get a second opinion.\nYou may want to get a second opinion to confirm your penile cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans. They may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another treatment approach, or provide more information about your cancer.\nLearn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion at\nFinding Cancer Care\n. You can contact\nNCI\u2019s Cancer Information Service\nvia chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor, hospital, or getting a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, visit\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor About Cancer\n.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe prognosis and treatment options depend on:\nthe\nstage\nof the cancer\nthe location and size of the tumor\nwhether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back)\nStages of Penile Cancer\nKey Points\nThe following stages are used for penile cancer:\nStage 0 (carcinoma in situ)\nStage I (also called stage 1) penile cancer\nStage II (also called stage 2) penile cancer\nStage III (also called stage 3) penile cancer\nStage IV (also called stage 4) penile cancer\nPenile cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nCancer stage describes the extent of cancer in the body, such as the size of the tumor, whether it has spread, and how far it has spread from where it first formed. It is important to know the stage of the penile cancer to plan the best treatment.\nThere are several staging systems for cancer that describe the extent of the cancer. Penile cancer staging usually uses the\nTNM staging system\n. The cancer may be described by this staging system in your pathology report. Based on the TNM results, a stage (I, II, III, or IV, also written as 1, 2, 3, or 4) is assigned to your cancer. When talking to you about your diagnosis, your doctor may describe the cancer as one of these stages.\nLearn about\ntests to stage penile cancer\n. Learn more about\nCancer Staging\n.\nThe following stages are used for penile cancer:\nStage 0 (carcinoma in situ)\nStage 0\nis divided into stages 0is and 0a.\nIn stage 0is, abnormal cells are found on the surface of the skin of the penis. These abnormal cells form growths that may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0is is also called carcinoma in situ or penile intraepithelial neoplasia.\nIn stage 0a,\nsquamous cell cancer\nthat does not spread is found on the surface of the skin of the penis or on the underneath surface of the\nforeskin\nof the penis. Stage 0a is also called noninvasive localized squamous cell carcinoma.\nStage I (also called stage 1) penile cancer\nIn stage I, cancer has formed and spread to tissue just under the skin of the penis. Cancer has not spread to\nlymph vessels\n,\nblood vessels\n, or\nnerves\n. The cancer cells look more like normal cells under a microscope.\nStage II (also called stage 2) penile cancer\nStage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.\nIn stage IIA, cancer has spread:\nto tissue just under the skin of the penis. Cancer has spread to\nlymph vessels\n,\nblood vessels\n, and/or\nnerves\n; or\nto tissue just under the skin of the penis. Under a microscope, the cancer cells look very abnormal or the cells are\nsarcomatoid\n; or\ninto the corpus spongiosum (spongy erectile tissue in the shaft and\nglans\nthat fills with blood to make an\nerection\n).\nIn stage IIB, cancer has spread:\nthrough the layer of\nconnective tissue\nthat surrounds the\ncorpus cavernosum\nand into the corpus cavernosum (spongy erectile tissue that runs along the shaft of the penis).\nStage III (also called stage 3) penile cancer\nStage III is divided into stages IIIA and stage IIIB. Cancer is found in the penis.\nIn stage IIIA, cancer has spread to 1 or 2\nlymph nodes\non one side of the\ngroin\n.\nIn stage IIIB, cancer has spread to 3 or more lymph nodes on one side of the groin or to lymph nodes on both sides of the groin.\nStage IV (also called stage 4) penile cancer\nIn\nstage IV\n, cancer has spread:\nto tissues near the penis, such as the\nscrotum\n,\nprostate\n, or pubic bone, and may have spread to\nlymph nodes\nin the\ngroin\nor\npelvis\n; or\nto one or more lymph nodes in the pelvis, or cancer has spread through the outer covering of the lymph nodes to nearby tissue; or\nto lymph nodes outside the pelvis or to other parts of the body, such as the\nlung\n,\nliver\n, or bone.\nStage IV penile cancer is also called metastatic penile cancer. Metastatic cancer happens when cancer cells travel through the\nlymphatic system\nor blood and form tumors in other parts of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if penile cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually penile cancer cells. The disease is called metastatic penile cancer, not liver cancer. Learn more in\nMetastatic Cancer: When Cancer Spreads\n.\nPenile cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nRecurrent penile cancer is cancer that has come back after it has been treated. If penile cancer comes back, it may come back in the\n\t\tpenis or in other parts of the\n\t\tbody, such as the liver or lungs. Tests will be done to help determine where the cancer has returned. The type of treatment for recurrent penile cancer will depend on where it has come back.\nLearn more in\nRecurrent Cancer: When Cancer Comes Back\n. Information to help you cope and talk with your health care team can be found in the booklet\nWhen Cancer Returns\n.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for people with penile cancer.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nRadiosensitizers\nSentinel lymph node biopsy followed by surgery\nTreatment for penile cancer may cause side effects.\nFollow-up care may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for people with penile cancer.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for penile cancer. You and your cancer care team will work together to decide your treatment plan, which may include more than one type of treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as the stage of the cancer, your overall health, and your preferences. Your plan will include information about your cancer, the goals of treatment, your treatment options and the possible side effects, and the expected length of treatment.\nTalking with your cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect will be helpful. You\u2019ll want to learn what you need to do before treatment begins, how you\u2019ll feel while going through it, and what kind of help you will need. To learn more, visit\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor About Treatment\n.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery is the most common treatment for all\nstages\nof penile cancer. A doctor may remove the cancer using one of the following operations:\nMohs microsurgery\n: A procedure in which the tumor is cut from the skin in thin layers. During the  surgery, the edges of the tumor and each layer of tumor removed are viewed through a microscope to check for cancer cells. Layers continue to be removed until no more cancer cells are seen. This type of surgery removes as little normal tissue as possible and is often used to remove cancer on the skin. \n\n\nIt is also called Mohs surgery.\nEnlarge\nMohs surgery. A surgical procedure to remove a visible lesion on the skin in several steps. First, a thin layer of cancerous tissue is removed. Then, a second thin layer of tissue is removed and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells. More layers are removed one at a time until the tissue viewed under a microscope shows no remaining cancer. This type of surgery is used to remove as little normal tissue as possible.\nLaser surgery: A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface lesion such as a tumor.\nCryosurgery\n:  A treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy.\nCircumcision: Surgery to remove part or all of the\nforeskin\nof the penis.\nWide local excision\n: Surgery to remove only the cancer and some normal tissue around it.\nAmputation of the penis:  Surgery to remove part or all of the penis. If part of the penis is removed, it is a partial\npenectomy\n. If all of the penis is removed, it is a total penectomy.\nLymph nodes\nin the\ngroin\nmay be taken out during surgery.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nafter surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer.\nThe way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.  External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat penile cancer.\nLearn more about\nRadiation Therapy to Treat Cancer\nand\nRadiation Therapy Side Effects\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy (also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.\nTopical chemotherapy is placed directly onto the skin, where it mainly affects cancer cells in those areas.  Topical chemotherapy, such as\nfluorouracil\nmay be used  to treat\nstage 0 penile cancer\n.\nSystemic chemotherapy is when chemotherapy drugs are taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a vein or muscle. When given this way, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body.  Systemic chemotherapy may be used if the cancer is too large to be removed by surgery or has spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.\nLearn more about how chemotherapy works, how it is given, common side effects, and more at\nChemotherapy to Treat Cancer\nand\nChemotherapy and You: Support for People With Cancer\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy helps a person\u2019s\nimmune system\nfight cancer.\nImmunotherapy drugs used to treat penile cancer include:\ntopical\nimiquimod\nLearn more about\nImmunotherapy to Treat Cancer\n.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nA treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be an option.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nTo learn more about clinical trials, see\nClinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers\n.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nRadiosensitizers\nRadiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers helps kill more tumor cells.\nSentinel lymph node biopsy followed by surgery\nSentinel lymph node biopsy\nis the removal of the\nsentinel lymph node\nduring surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node in a group of lymph nodes to receive\nlymphatic drainage\nfrom the\nprimary tumor\n. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor.  A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor.  The substance or dye flows through the\nlymph\nducts\nto the lymph nodes.  The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed.   A\npathologist\nviews the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.  If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes. After the sentinel lymph node biopsy, the surgeon removes the cancer.\nTreatment for penile cancer may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nFollow-up care may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Stage 0\nTreatment of\nstage 0\nmay include:\nMohs microsurgery\ntopical chemotherapy\ntopical\nimmunotherapy with\nimiquimod\nlaser surgery\ncryosurgery\nLearn more about these treatments in the\nTreatment Option Overview\n.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

It has four lobes and fills the upper right side of the abdomen inside the rib cage. Three of the many important functions of the liver are:         - To filter harmful substances from the blood so they can be passed from the body in stools and urine.    - To make bile to help digest fats from food.    - To store glycogen (sugar), which the body uses for energy.

        "context": "Liver Cancer Screening\nScreening is looking for cancer before a person has any symptoms. This can help find cancer at an early stage. When\nabnormal\ntissue or cancer is found early, it may be easier to treat.\nIt is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily think you have cancer if he or she suggests a screening test. Screening tests are given when you have no cancer symptoms.\n\nIf a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called diagnostic tests.\nTests to screen for liver cancer\nAlthough there is no standard or routine screening tests for\nliver cancer\n, the following tests are being used or studied to screen for it:\nUltrasound\nUltrasound is a procedure in which high-energy waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the liver and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of the liver called a sonogram.\nCT scan\nCT scan\nis a procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of the liver, taken from different angles.

This procedure is also called CAT scan or computed tomography.\nAlpha-fetoprotein tumor marker\nTumor markers\n, also called biomarkers, are substances made by the\ntumor\nthat may be found in the blood, other body fluids, or tissues. A high level of a specific tumor marker may mean that a certain type of cancer is present in the body.\nAlpha-fetoprotein\n(AFP) is the most widely used tumor marker for detecting liver cancer. However, other cancers and certain conditions, including pregnancy,\nhepatitis\n, and other types of cancer, may also increase AFP levels.\nSpecific tumor markers that may lead to early detection of liver cancer are being studied.\nDoctors use these screening tests to find, or diagnose, liver cancer.

Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risk of harms associated with them. Before having any screening test, you may want to discuss the test with your doctor. It is important to be aware of any possible harms of the test and whether the test has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from cancer.\nThe risks of liver cancer screening include the following:\nFalse-negative test results can occur.\nScreening test results may appear to be normal even though liver cancer is present. A person who receives a false-negative test result\u202f(one that shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care even if there are symptoms.\nFalse-positive test results can occur.\nScreening test results may appear to be abnormal even though no cancer is present.

It occurs when malignant cells form and spread throughout the liver, leading to abnormal functioning of this vital organ. The liver is responsible for multiple crucial functions within the human body such as filtering blood, producing bile to aid in digestion, and storing glycogen which provides energy.\n\nLiver cancer is less common in the United States than in other parts of the world. However, certain demographics such as Chinese American men are at a greater risk of developing liver cancer. Risk factors that contribute to an increased likelihood of developing liver cancer include having hepatitis or cirrhosis. These conditions can damage liver tissue and promote the growth of malignant cells. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment, and screening tests like ultrasound, CT scans, and Alpha-fetoprotein tumor markers are employed to detect liver cancer before symptoms manifest. Despite these advancements in medical technology, false negative or positive results can occur, leading to unnecessary diagnostic procedures and emotional distress for the patient."

Some of the  lymph nodes under the arm may be removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.    Types of surgery to remove the cancer include:            -  Modified radical mastectomy: Surgery to remove the whole breast that has cancer, many of the lymph nodes under the arm, the lining over the chest muscles, and sometimes, part of the chest wall muscles. This type of surgery is most common in pregnant women.     -  Breast-conserving surgery: Surgery to remove the cancer and some normal tissue around it, but not the breast itself. Part of the chest wall lining may also be removed if the cancer is near it. This type of surgery may also be called lumpectomy, partial mastectomy, segmental mastectomy, quadrantectomy, or breast-sparing surgery.           Even if the doctor removes all of the cancer that can be seen at the time of surgery, the patient may be given radiation therapy or chemotherapy after surgery to try to kill any cancer cells that may be left. For pregnant women with early-stage breast cancer, radiation therapy and hormone therapy are given after the baby is born. Treatment given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    External radiation therapy is not given to pregnant women with early stage (stage I or II) breast cancer because it can harm the unborn baby. For women with late stage (stage III or IV) breast cancer, radiation therapy is not given during the first 3 months of pregnancy and is delayed until after the baby is born, if possible.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    Chemotherapy is usually not given during the first 3 months of pregnancy. Chemotherapy given after this time does not usually harm the unborn baby but may cause early labor and low birth weight.

        "context": "Breast Cancer Treatment During Pregnancy  (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Breast Cancer Treatment During Pregnancy\nKey Points\nBreast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the tissues of the breast.\nSometimes breast cancer occurs in women who are\n\t\t  pregnant or have just given birth.\nSigns of breast cancer include a lump or change in the breast.\nIt may be difficult to detect (find) breast cancer early in\n\t\t  pregnant or nursing women.\nBreast exams should be part of prenatal and postnatal care.\nTests that examine the breasts are used to diagnose \n\t\t  breast cancer.\nIf cancer is found, tests are done to study the cancer cells.\nCertain factors affect  prognosis\n\t\t  (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nBreast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the tissues of the breast.\nThe\nbreast\nis made up of\nlobes\nand\nducts\n. Each breast has 15 to 20 sections called\n\t\t  lobes. Each lobe has many smaller sections called\nlobules\n. Lobules end in dozens of tiny bulbs that\n\t\t  can make milk. The lobes, lobules, and bulbs are linked by thin tubes called\n\t\t  ducts.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the female breast. The nipple and areola are shown on the outside of the breast. The lymph nodes, lobes, lobules, ducts, and other parts of the inside of the breast are also shown.\nEach breast also has\nblood\n\t\t  vessels\nand\nlymph\n\t\t  vessels\n. The lymph vessels carry an almost colorless, watery\nfluid\ncalled\nlymph\n. Lymph\n\t\t  vessels carry lymph between\nlymph\n\t\t  nodes\n. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures found throughout the body. They\nfilter\nlymph and store\nwhite blood cells\nthat help fight\ninfection\nand disease. Groups of lymph nodes are found near the breast in the\naxilla\n(under the arm), above the\ncollarbone\n, and in the chest.\nSometimes breast cancer occurs in women who are\n\t\t  pregnant or have just given birth.\nBreast cancer\noccurs about once in every 3,000\npregnancies\n. It occurs most often  in women aged 32 to 38 years. Because many women are choosing to delay having children, it is\nlikely that  the number of new cases of breast cancer during pregnancy will increase.\nSigns of breast cancer include a lump or change in the breast.\nThese and other\nsigns\nmay be caused by breast cancer or by other\nconditions\n. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:\nA lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm area.\nA change in the size or shape of the breast.\nA dimple or puckering in the skin of the breast.\nA\nnipple\nturned inward into the breast.\nFluid, other than breast milk, from the nipple, especially if it's bloody.\nScaly, red, or swollen skin on the breast, nipple, or\nareola\n(the dark area of skin around the nipple).\nDimples in the breast that look like the skin of an orange, called\npeau\n\t\td\u2019orange\n.\nIt may be difficult to detect (find) breast cancer early in\n\t\t  pregnant or nursing women.\nThe breasts usually get larger, tender, or lumpy in women who are pregnant, nursing, or have just given birth. This occurs because of normal\nhormone\nchanges that take place during pregnancy. These changes can make small lumps difficult to detect. The breasts may also become denser. It is more difficult to detect breast cancer in women with dense breasts using\nmammography\n. Because these breast changes can delay\ndiagnosis\n, breast cancer is often found at a later\nstage\nin these women.\nBreast exams should be part of prenatal and postnatal care.\nTo detect breast cancer, pregnant and nursing women should examine\n\t\t  their breasts themselves. Women should also receive\nclinical breast\n\t\t  exams\nduring their regular\nprenatal\nand postnatal check-ups. Talk to your doctor if you notice any changes in your breasts that you do not expect or that worry you.\nTests that examine the breasts are used to diagnose \n\t\t  breast cancer.\nThe\n\t\t  following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient\u2019s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nClinical breast exam (CBE)\n: An exam of the breast by a doctor or other health professional. The doctor will carefully feel the breasts and under the arms for lumps or anything else that seems unusual.\nUltrasound\nexam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal\ntissues\nor\norgans\nand make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. The picture can be printed to look at later.\nMammogram\n: An\nx-ray\nof the breast. A mammogram can be done with little\n\t\t\t risk to the\nfetus\n. Mammograms in\n\t\t\t pregnant women may appear\nnegative\neven though cancer is present.\nEnlarge\nMammography. The breast is pressed between two plates.  X-rays are used to take pictures of breast tissue.\nBiopsy\n: The removal\n\t\t\t of\ncells\nor tissues so they can be viewed under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. If a lump in the breast is\n\t\t\t found, a biopsy may be done.\nThere are three types of breast biopsies:\nExcisional\n\t\t\t\t  biopsy\n:  The removal of an entire lump of tissue.\nCore biopsy\n:\n\t\t\t\t  The removal of tissue using a wide needle.\nFine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy\n:\n\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t  The removal of tissue or fluid, using a thin needle.\nIf cancer is found, tests are done to study the cancer cells.\nDecisions about the best treatment are based on the results of these tests and the trimester of the pregnancy. The tests give information about:\nHow quickly the cancer may grow.\nHow likely it is that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body.\nHow well certain treatments might work.\nHow likely the cancer is to\nrecur\n(come back).\nTests may include the following:\nEstrogen\nand\nprogesterone receptor test\n: A test to measure the amount of\nestrogen\nand\nprogesterone (hormones) receptors\nin cancer tissue. If there are more estrogen or progesterone receptors than normal, the cancer is called\nestrogen receptor positive\nor\nprogesterone receptor positive\n. This type of breast cancer may grow more quickly. The test results show whether treatment to block estrogen and progesterone given after the baby is born may stop the cancer from growing.\nHuman epidermal growth factor type 2 receptor (HER2/neu) test\n: A\nlaboratory test\nto measure how many\nHER2/neu\ngenes\nthere are and how much HER2/neu\nprotein\nis made in a sample of tissue. If there are more\nHER2/neu\ngenes or higher levels of HER2/neu protein than normal, the cancer is called\nHER2/neu positive\n.  This type of breast cancer may grow more quickly and is more likely to spread to other parts of the body. The cancer may be treated with\ndrugs\nthat target the HER2/neu protein, such as\ntrastuzumab\nand\npertuzumab\n, after the baby is born.\nMultigene tests\n: Tests in which samples of tissue are studied to look at the activity of many genes at the same time. These tests may help predict whether cancer will spread to other parts of the body or recur (come back).\nOncotype DX\n: This test helps predict whether stage I or stage II breast cancer that is\nestrogen receptor positive\nand\nnode-negative\nwill spread to other parts of the body. If the risk of the cancer spreading is high,\nchemotherapy\nmay be given to lower the risk.\nMammaPrint\n: A laboratory test in which the activity of 70 different genes is looked at in the breast cancer tissue of women who have\nearly-stage\ninvasive breast cancer\nthat has not spread to lymph nodes or has spread to 3 or fewer lymph nodes. The activity level of these genes helps predict whether breast cancer will spread to other parts of the body or come back. If the test shows that the risk that the cancer will spread or come back is high, chemotherapy may be given to lower the risk.\nCertain factors affect  prognosis\n\t\t  (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe stage\n\t\t  of the cancer (the size of the\ntumor\nand whether it is in the breast only or has spread to other parts of the body).\nThe type of breast cancer.\nThe trimester of the pregnancy.\nWhether there\n\t\t  are signs or\nsymptoms\n.\nThe patient\u2019s\n\t\t  general health.\nStages of Breast Cancer\nKey Points\nAfter breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done\n\t\t  to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of\n\t\t  the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nIn breast cancer, stage is based on the size and location of the primary tumor, the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body, tumor grade, and whether certain biomarkers are present.\nThe TNM system is used to describe the size of the primary tumor and the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body.\nTumor (T).  The size and location of the tumor.\nLymph Node (N). The size and location of lymph nodes where cancer has spread.\nMetastasis (M). The spread of cancer to other parts of the body.\nThe grading system is used to describe how quickly a breast tumor is likely to grow and spread.\nBiomarker testing is used to find out whether breast cancer cells have certain receptors.\nThe TNM system, the grading system, and biomarker status are combined to find out the breast cancer stage.\nTalk to your doctor to find out what your breast cancer stage is and how it is used to plan the best treatment for you.\nAfter breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done\n\t\t  to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of\n\t\t  the body.\nThe process used to find out if the\ncancer\nhas spread within the\nbreast\nor to other\n\t\t  parts of the body is called\nstaging\n.\n\t\t  The information gathered from the\n\t\t  staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know the stage  in order to plan treatment.\nSome procedures may expose the\nfetus\nto harmful\nradiation\nor dyes. These procedures are done only if absolutely necessary. Certain actions, such as using a\nlead-lined shield\nto cover the\nabdomen\n,  are used to help protect the fetus from radiation as much as possible.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used to stage\nbreast cancer\nduring\npregnancy\n:\nChest x-ray\n: An x-ray of the\norgans\nand bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nBone scan\n: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing\ncells\n, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of\nradioactive\nmaterial is\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nand travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in bones with cancer and is detected by a\nscanner\n.\nUltrasound\nexam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal\ntissues\nor organs, such as the\nliver\n, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\nbrain\n. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if\nbreast cancer\nspreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually breast cancer cells. The disease is metastatic breast cancer, not\nbone cancer\n.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nIn breast cancer, stage is based on the size and location of the primary tumor, the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body, tumor grade, and whether certain biomarkers are present.\nTo plan the best treatment and understand your\nprognosis\n, it is important to know the breast cancer stage.\nThere are 3 types of breast cancer stage groups:\nClinical\nPrognostic Stage\nis used first to assign a stage for\nall\npatients based on\nhealth history\n,\nphysical exam\n,\nimaging tests\n(if done), and\nbiopsies\n. The Clinical Prognostic Stage is described by the\nTNM system\n,\ntumor grade\n, and\nbiomarker\nstatus (\nER\n,\nPR\n,\nHER2\n). In\nclinical staging\n,\nmammography\nor ultrasound is used to check the\nlymph nodes\nfor\nsigns\nof cancer.\nPathological Prognostic Stage\nis then used for patients who have\nsurgery\nas their first treatment. The Pathological Prognostic Stage is based on all clinical information, biomarker status, and\nlaboratory test\nresults from breast tissue and lymph nodes removed during surgery.\nAnatomic\nStage\nis based on the size and the spread of cancer as described by the TNM system. The Anatomic Stage is used in parts of the world where biomarker testing is not available. It is not used in the United States.\nThe TNM system is used to describe the size of the primary tumor and the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body.\nFor breast cancer, the TNM system describes the tumor as follows:\nTumor (T).  The size and location of the tumor.\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in millimeters (mm) or centimeters. Common items that can be used to show  tumor size in mm include: a sharp pencil point (1 mm), a new crayon point (2 mm), a pencil-top eraser (5 mm), a pea (10 mm), a peanut (20 mm), and a lime (50 mm).\nTX: Primary tumor cannot be assessed.\nT0: No sign of a primary tumor in the breast.\nTis:\nCarcinoma in situ\n. There are 2 types of breast carcinoma in situ:\nTis (\nDCIS\n): DCIS is a\ncondition\nin which\nabnormal\ncells are found in the lining of a\nbreast duct\n. The abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast. In some cases, DCIS may become\ninvasive breast cancer\nthat is able to spread to other tissues. At this time, there is no way to know which\nlesions\ncan become invasive.\nTis (\nPaget disease\n): Paget disease of the\nnipple\nis a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the skin cells of the nipple and may spread to the\nareola\n. It is not staged according to the TNM system. If Paget disease AND an invasive breast cancer are present, the TNM system is used to stage the invasive breast cancer.\nT1: The tumor is 20\nmillimeters\nor smaller. There are 4 subtypes of a T1 tumor depending on the size of the tumor:\nT1mi: the tumor is 1 millimeter or smaller.\nT1a: the tumor is larger than 1 millimeter but not larger than 5 millimeters.\nT1b: the tumor is larger than 5 millimeters but not larger than 10 millimeters.\nT1c: the tumor is larger than 10 millimeters but not larger than 20 millimeters.\nT2: The tumor is larger than 20 millimeters but not larger than 50 millimeters.\nT3: The tumor is larger than 50 millimeters.\nT4: The tumor is described as one of the following:\nT4a: the tumor has grown into the\nchest wall\n.\nT4b: the tumor has grown into the skin\u2014an\nulcer\nhas formed on the surface of the skin on the breast, small tumor nodules have formed in the same breast as the primary tumor, and/or there is swelling of the skin on the breast.\nT4c: the tumor has grown into the chest wall and the skin.\nT4d:\ninflammatory breast cancer\n\u2014one-third or more of the skin on the breast is red and swollen (called\npeau d\u2019orange\n).\nLymph Node (N). The size and location of lymph nodes where cancer has spread.\nWhen the lymph nodes are removed by surgery and studied under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\n, pathologic staging is used to describe the lymph nodes. The pathologic staging of lymph nodes is described below.\nNX: The lymph nodes cannot be assessed.\nN0:  No sign of cancer in the lymph nodes, or tiny clusters of cancer cells not larger than 0.2 millimeters in the lymph nodes.\nN1: Cancer is described as one of the following:\nN1mi: cancer has spread to the\naxillary (armpit area) lymph nodes\nand is larger than 0.2 millimeters but not larger than 2 millimeters.\nN1a: cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters.\nN1b: cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the\nbreastbone\non the same side of the body as the primary tumor, and the cancer is larger than 0.2 millimeters and is found by\nsentinel lymph node biopsy\n. Cancer is not found in the axillary lymph nodes.\nN1c: cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer is also found by sentinel lymph node biopsy in the lymph nodes near the breastbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor.\nN2: Cancer is described as one of the following:\nN2a: cancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters.\nN2b: cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone and the cancer is found by imaging tests. Cancer is not found in the axillary lymph nodes by sentinel lymph node biopsy or\nlymph node dissection\n.\nN3: Cancer is described as one of the following:\nN3a: cancer has spread to 10 or more axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters, or cancer has spread to lymph nodes below the\ncollarbone\n.\nN3b: cancer has spread to 1 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer has also spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone and the cancer is found by imaging tests;\nor\ncancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer has also spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor, and the cancer is  larger than 0.2 millimeters and is found by sentinel lymph node biopsy.\nN3c: cancer has spread to lymph nodes above the collarbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor.\nWhen the lymph nodes are checked using mammography or ultrasound, it is called clinical staging. The clinical staging of lymph nodes is not described here.\nMetastasis (M). The spread of cancer to other parts of the body.\nM0: There is no sign that cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\nM1: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body, most often the bones,\nlungs\n, liver, or brain. If cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes, the cancer in the lymph nodes is larger than 0.2 millimeters. The cancer is called metastatic breast cancer.\nThe grading system is used to describe how quickly a breast tumor is likely to grow and spread.\nThe\ngrading\nsystem describes a tumor based on how abnormal the cancer cells and tissue look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer cells are likely to grow and spread.\nLow-grade\ncancer cells look more like normal cells and tend to grow and spread more slowly than\nhigh-grade\ncancer cells. To describe how abnormal the cancer cells and tissue are, the pathologist will assess the following three features:\nHow much of the tumor tissue has normal breast ducts.\nThe size and shape of the\nnuclei\nin the tumor cells.\nHow many dividing cells are present, which is a measure of how fast the tumor cells are growing and dividing.\nFor each feature, the pathologist assigns a score of 1 to 3; a score of \u201c1\u201d means the cells and tumor tissue look the most like normal cells and tissue, and a score of \u201c3\u201d means the cells and tissue look the most abnormal. The scores for each feature are added together to get a total score between 3 and 9.\nThree grades are possible:\nTotal score of 3 to 5: G1 (Low grade or\nwell differentiated\n).\nTotal score of 6 to 7: G2 (\nIntermediate grade\nor moderately differentiated).\nTotal score of 8 to 9: G3 (High grade or poorly differentiated).\nBiomarker testing is used to find out whether breast cancer cells have certain receptors.\nHealthy breast cells, and some breast cancer cells, have\nreceptors\n(biomarkers) that attach to the\nhormones\nestrogen\nand\nprogesterone\n. These hormones are needed for healthy cells, and some breast cancer cells, to grow and divide. To check for these biomarkers, samples of tissue containing breast cancer cells are removed during a\nbiopsy\nor surgery. The samples are tested in a laboratory to see whether the breast cancer cells have\nestrogen\nor\nprogesterone receptors\n.\nAnother type of receptor (biomarker) that is found on the surface of all breast cancer cells is called HER2. HER2 receptors are needed for the breast cancer cells to grow and divide.\nFor breast cancer, biomarker testing includes the following:\nEstrogen receptor (ER)\n. If the breast cancer cells have estrogen receptors, the cancer cells are called\nER positive\n(ER+). If the breast cancer cells do not have estrogen receptors, the cancer cells are called\nER negative\n(ER-).\nProgesterone receptor (PR)\n. If the breast cancer cells have progesterone receptors, the cancer cells are called\nPR positive\n(PR+). If the breast cancer cells do not have progesterone receptors, the cancer cells are called\nPR negative\n(PR-).\nHuman epidermal growth factor type 2 receptor (HER2/neu or HER2)\n. If the breast cancer cells have larger than normal amounts of HER2 receptors on their surface, the cancer cells are called\nHER2 positive\n(HER2+). If the breast cancer cells have a normal amount of HER2 on their surface, the cancer cells are called\nHER2 negative\n(HER2-). HER2+ breast cancer is more likely to grow and divide faster than HER2- breast cancer.\nSometimes the breast cancer cells will be described as\ntriple negative\nor\ntriple positive\n.\nTriple negative\n. If the breast cancer cells do not have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or a larger than normal amount of HER2 receptors, the cancer cells are called triple negative.\nTriple positive\n. If the breast cancer cells do have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and a larger than normal amount of HER2 receptors, the cancer cells are called triple positive.\nIt is important to know the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 receptor status to choose the best treatment. There are\ndrugs\nthat can stop the receptors from attaching to the hormones estrogen and progesterone and stop the cancer from growing. Other drugs may be used to block the HER2 receptors on the surface of the breast cancer cells and stop the cancer from growing.\nThe TNM system, the grading system, and biomarker status are combined to find out the breast cancer stage.\nHere are 3 examples that combine the TNM system, the grading system, and the biomarker status to find out the Pathological Prognostic breast cancer stage for a woman whose first treatment was surgery:\nIf the tumor size is 30 millimeters (T2), has not spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0), has not spread to distant parts of the body (M0), and is:\nGrade 1\nHER2+\nER-\nPR-\nThe cancer is stage IIA.\nIf the tumor size is 53 millimeters (T3), has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes (N2), has not spread to other parts of the body (M0), and is:\nGrade 2\nHER2+\nER+\nPR-\nThe tumor is stage IIIA.\nIf the tumor size is 65 millimeters (T3), has spread to 3 axillary lymph nodes (N1a), has spread to the lungs (M1), and is:\nGrade 1\nHER2+\nER-\nPR-\nThe cancer is stage IV (metastatic breast cancer).\nTalk to your doctor to find out what your breast cancer stage is and how it is used to plan the best treatment for you.\nAfter surgery, your doctor will receive a\npathology report\nthat describes the size and location of the primary tumor, the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes, tumor grade, and whether certain biomarkers are present. The pathology report and other test results are used to determine your breast cancer stage.\nYou are likely to have many questions. Ask your doctor to explain how staging is used to decide the best options to treat your cancer and whether there are\nclinical trials\nthat might be right for you.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nTreatment options for pregnant women depend on the stage of the\n\t\t  disease and the trimester of the pregnancy.\nThree types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nEnding the pregnancy does not seem to improve the mother\u2019s\n\t\t  chance of survival.\nTreatment for breast cancer may cause side effects.\nTreatment options for pregnant women depend on the stage of the\n\t\t  disease and the trimester of the pregnancy.\nThree types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nMost\npregnant\nwomen with\nbreast cancer\nhave\nsurgery\nto remove the\nbreast\n. Some of the\nlymph\n\t\t\t nodes\nunder the arm may be removed so they can be checked under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nfor\nsigns\nof\ncancer\n.\nTypes of surgery to remove the cancer include:\nModified radical\n\t\t\t\tmastectomy\n: Surgery to remove the whole breast that has cancer. This may include removal of the\nnipple\n,\nareola\n(the dark-colored skin around the nipple), and skin over the breast. Most of the lymph nodes under the arm are also removed.\nEnlarge\nModified radical mastectomy.  The whole breast and most of the lymph nodes under the arm are removed.\nBreast-conserving\n\t\t\t surgery\n: Surgery to remove the cancer and some normal\ntissue\naround it, but not the breast\n\t\t\t itself. Part of the chest wall lining may also be removed if the cancer is near it. This type of surgery may also be called lumpectomy, partial mastectomy, segmental mastectomy, quadrantectomy, or breast-sparing surgery.\nEnlarge\nLumpectomy. The tumor and some normal tissue around it are removed, but not the breast itself. Some lymph nodes under the arm may also be removed. If the cancer is near the chest wall, part of the chest wall lining may be removed as well.\nAfter the doctor removes all of the cancer that can be seen at\n\t\t\t the time of surgery, some patients may be given\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nafter surgery to kill any cancer\ncells\nthat are left. For pregnant women with\nearly-stage breast cancer\n, radiation therapy and\nhormone therapy\nare given after the baby is born. Treatment given after surgery, to\n\t\t\t lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant\n\t\t\t therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nExternal radiation therapy may be given to pregnant women with early\nstage\n(stage I or II)  breast cancer after the baby is born.  Women with late stage (stage III or IV) breast cancer may be given external radiation therapy after the first 3 months of pregnancy or, if possible, radiation therapy is delayed until after the baby is born.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.

The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium.\nSigns and symptoms of ovarian low malignant potential tumor include pain or swelling in the abdomen.\nOvarian low malignant potential tumor may not cause early signs or\nsymptoms\n. If you do have signs or symptoms, they may include the following:\nPain or swelling in the\nabdomen\n.\nPain in the pelvis.\nGastrointestinal\nproblems, such as gas,\nbloating\n, or\nconstipation\n.\nThese signs and symptoms may be caused by other\nconditions\n. If they get worse or do not go away on their own, check with your doctor.\nTests that examine the ovaries are used to diagnose and stage ovarian low malignant potential tumor.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient\u2019s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nPelvic exam\n: An exam of the\nvagina\n,\ncervix\n, uterus,\nfallopian tubes\n, ovaries, and\nrectum\n.    A\nspeculum\nis inserted into the vagina and the doctor or\nnurse\nlooks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A\nPap test\nof the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two\nlubricated\n, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.\nEnlarge\nPelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.\nUltrasound\nexam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal\ntissues\nor organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.\nEnlarge\nAbdominal ultrasound.

The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nCA 125\nassay\n: A test that measures the level of CA 125 in the\nblood\n. CA 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream. An increased CA 125 level is sometimes a sign of cancer or other condition.\nChest x-ray\n: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.

The information gathered from the staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know the\n\t\t  stage  in order to\n\t\t  plan treatment. Certain tests or procedures are used for staging. Staging\nlaparotomy\n(a\nsurgical\nincision\nmade in the wall of the\nabdomen\nto remove\novarian\ntissue\n)\n\t\t  may be used. Most patients are\ndiagnosed\nwith stage\n\t\t  I disease.\nThe following stages are used for ovarian low malignant potential tumor:\nStage I\nIn stage I, the\ntumor\nis found in one or both\novaries\nor\nfallopian tubes\n. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IC.\nStage IA: The tumor is found inside a single ovary or fallopian tube.\nStage IB: The tumor is found inside both ovaries or fallopian tubes.\nStage IC: The tumor is found inside one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and one of the following is true:\ntumor\ncells\nare found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes; or\nthe\ncapsule\n(outer covering) of the ovary ruptured (broke open) before or during\nsurgery\n; or\ntumor cells are found in the\nfluid\nof the\nperitoneal cavity\n(the body\ncavity\nthat contains most of the\norgans\nin the\nabdomen\n) or in\nwashings\nof the\nperitoneum\n(\ntissue\nlining the peritoneal cavity).\nStage II\nIn stage II, the\ntumor\nis found in one or both\novaries\nor\nfallopian tubes\nand has spread into other areas of the\npelvis\n, or\nprimary peritoneal cancer\nis found within the pelvis. Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB.\nStage IIA: The tumor has spread from where it first formed to the\nuterus\nand/or the fallopian tubes and/or the ovaries.\nStage IIB: The tumor has spread from the ovary or fallopian tube to\norgans\nin  the\nperitoneal cavity\n(the space that contains the\nabdominal\norgans).\nStage III\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).\nIn stage III, the\ntumor\nis found in one or both\novaries\nor\nfallopian tubes\n, or is\nprimary peritoneal cancer\n, and has spread outside the\npelvis\nto other parts of the\nabdomen\nand/or to nearby\nlymph nodes\n.\n\t\t\t  Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC.\nIn stage IIIA, one of the following is true:\nThe tumor has spread to lymph nodes in the area outside or behind the\nperitoneum\nonly;      or\nTumor\ncells\nthat can be seen only with a\nmicroscope\nhave spread to the surface of the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the\nomentum\n(a fold of the peritoneum that surrounds the\nstomach\nand other\norgans\nin the abdomen). The tumor may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nStage IIIB\n: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the omentum, and the tumor  in the peritoneum is 2\ncentimeters\nor smaller. \nThe tumor may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum.\nStage IIIC: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the omentum, and the tumor in the peritoneum is\n\t\t\t\tlarger than 2 centimeters. The tumor may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum or to the surface of the\nliver\nor\nspleen\n.\nStage IV\nIn stage IV,\ntumor\ncells\nhave spread beyond the\nabdomen\nto other parts of the body. Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB.\nStage IVA: Tumor cells are found in  extra\nfluid\nthat builds up  around the\nlungs\n.\nStage IVB: The tumor  has spread to\norgans\nand\ntissues\noutside the abdomen, including\nlymph nodes\nin the\ngroin\n.\nOvarian low\n\t\tmalignant potential\n\t\ttumors can recur\n\t\t(come back) after  they have been treated.\nThe\ntumors\nmay come back in the other\novary\nor in other parts of the\n\t\tbody.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian low\n\t\t  malignant potential tumor.\nTwo types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nChemotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nTreatment for ovarian low malignant potential tumors may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian low\n\t\t  malignant potential tumor.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\n\t\t  ovarian low\n\t\t  malignant potential\n\t\t  tumor. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some\n\t\t  are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.\n\t\t   A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help\n\t\t  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients\n\t\t  with\ncancer\n,\ntumors\n, and related\nconditions\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nTwo types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nThe type of\nsurgery\n(removing the\ntumor\nin an operation) depends on\n\t\t\t the size and spread of the tumor and the woman\u2019s plans for having children. Surgery\n\t\t\t may include the following:\nUnilateral\n\t\t\t\tsalpingo-oophorectomy\n: Surgery to remove one\novary\nand one\nfallopian tube\n.\nBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.\nTotal hysterectomy\nand\n\t\t\t\tbilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove the\nuterus\n,\ncervix\n, and both ovaries and fallopian tubes.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the\nvagina\n, the operation is called a\nvaginal\nhysterectomy\n.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large\nincision\n(cut) in the\nabdomen\n, the operation is called a total\nabdominal\nhysterectomy.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a\nlaparoscope\n, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.\nEnlarge\nHysterectomy. The uterus is surgically removed with or without other organs or tissues. In a total hysterectomy, the uterus and cervix are removed. In a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy, (a) the uterus plus one (unilateral) ovary and fallopian tube are removed; or (b) the uterus plus both (bilateral) ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed. In a radical hysterectomy, the uterus, cervix, both ovaries, both fallopian tubes, and nearby tissue are removed. These procedures are done using a low transverse incision or a vertical incision.\nPartial oophorectomy\n: Surgery to remove part of one ovary or part of both ovaries.\nOmentectomy\n:\n\t\t\t\tSurgery to remove the\nomentum\n(a piece of the\ntissue\nlining the abdominal wall).\nAfter the doctor removes all disease that can be seen at the\n\t\t\t time of the surgery, the patient may be given\nchemotherapy\nafter surgery to kill any tumor\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given\n\t\t\t after the surgery, to lower the risk that the tumor will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n, an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and\nstage\nof the cancer being treated.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nInformation about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for ovarian low malignant potential tumors may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the medical research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.\nMany of today's standard treatments for disease are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way diseases will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose disease has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop a disease from\nrecurring\n(coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nSome of the tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nthe disease may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. This is sometimes called re-staging.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the disease has\nrecurred\n(come back).

        "hallucinated_answer": "What is (are) Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors ? \nOvarian low malignant potential tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissue covering the ovary. It may be caused by certain factors and can have various symptoms including pain or swelling in the abdomen. Tests are used to detect, diagnose, and stage ovarian low malignant potential tumor. Certain factors affect prognosis and treatment options.\nThe ovaries are a pair of organs in the female reproductive system. Each ovary makes eggs and female hormones. The disease usually remains in the ovary, but when found in one, the other should also be checked carefully for signs of disease."

        "context": "Uterine Sarcoma Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Uterine Sarcoma\nKey Points\nUterine sarcoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in\n\t\t  the muscles of the uterus or other  tissues that support the uterus.\nPast treatment with radiation therapy to the pelvis can increase the risk of uterine sarcoma.\nSigns of uterine sarcoma include abnormal bleeding.\nTests that examine the uterus are used to diagnose uterine sarcoma.\nCertain factors affect  prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nUterine sarcoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in\n\t\t  the muscles of the uterus or other  tissues that support the uterus.\nThe\nuterus\nis part of the female\nreproductive system\n. The uterus is the hollow, pear-shaped\norgan\nin the\npelvis\n, where a\nfetus\ngrows. The\ncervix\nis at the lower,\n\t\t  narrow end of the uterus, and leads to the\nvagina\n.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium.\nUterine sarcoma\nis a very rare kind of\ncancer\nthat forms in the uterine muscles or in\ntissues\nthat support the uterus. (Information about other types of\nsarcomas\ncan be found in the\nPDQ\nsummary on\nSoft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment\n.)\nUterine sarcoma is different from\nendometrial cancer\n, a disease in which cancer  forms  in the tissue that lines the  uterus.\nCarcinosarcoma\nis a subtype of endometrial cancer and is\nstaged\nusing endometrial\ncancer definitions. (For more information, see\nEndometrial Cancer Treatment\n.)\nUterine sarcomas include\nleiomyosarcomas\n, endometrial stromal sarcomas, and\nadenosarcomas\n.\nPast treatment with radiation therapy to the pelvis can increase the risk of uterine sarcoma.\nAnything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn\u2019t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for uterine sarcoma include the following:\nPast treatment with\nradiation therapy\nto the pelvis.\nTreatment with\ntamoxifen\nfor\nbreast cancer\n. If you are taking this\ndrug\n, have a\npelvic exam\nevery year and report\n\t\t  any\nvaginal\nbleeding (other than\nmenstrual\nbleeding) as soon as\n\t\t  possible.\nSigns of uterine sarcoma include abnormal bleeding.\nAbnormal\nbleeding from the vagina and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by uterine sarcoma or by other\nconditions\n.\n\t\t  Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nBleeding that is not part of\nmenstrual periods\n.\nBleeding after\nmenopause\n.\nA\nmass\nin the vagina.\nPain or a feeling of fullness in the\nabdomen\n.\nFrequent\nurination\n.\nTests that examine the uterus are used to diagnose uterine sarcoma.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient\u2019s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nPelvic exam\n: An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus,\nfallopian tubes\n,\novaries\n, and\nrectum\n.    A\nspeculum\nis inserted into the vagina and the doctor or\nnurse\nlooks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A\nPap test\nof the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two\nlubricated\n, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.\nEnlarge\nPelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.\nPap test\n: A procedure to collect cells from the surface of the cervix and vagina.  A piece of cotton, a brush, or a small wooden stick is used to gently scrape cells from the cervix and vagina.  The cells are viewed under a\nmicroscope\nto find out if they are abnormal.  This procedure is also called a Pap smear. Because uterine sarcoma  begins inside the uterus, this cancer may not show up on the Pap test.\nEnlarge\nPap test. A speculum is inserted into the vagina to widen it. Then, a brush is inserted into the vagina to collect cells from the cervix. The cells are checked under a microscope for signs of disease.\nTransvaginal ultrasound\nexam\n: A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and\nbladder\n. An\nultrasound transducer\n(probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (\nultrasound\n) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. The doctor can identify\ntumors\nby looking at the sonogram.\nEnlarge\nTransvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nDilatation and curettage\n:  A procedure to remove samples of tissue from the inner lining of the uterus.  The cervix is\ndilated\nand a\ncurette\n(spoon-shaped instrument) is inserted into the uterus to remove tissue.   The tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of disease.  This procedure is also called a D&C.\nEnlarge\nDilatation and curettage (D and C). A speculum is inserted into the vagina to widen it in order to look at the cervix (first panel). A dilator is used to widen the cervix (middle panel). A curette is put through the cervix into the uterus to scrape out abnormal tissue (last panel).\nEndometrial biopsy\n:  The removal of tissue from the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) by inserting a thin, flexible tube through the cervix and into the uterus.  The tube is used to gently scrape a small amount of tissue from the endometrium and then remove the tissue samples.  A\npathologist\nviews the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.\nCertain factors affect  prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe\nstage\nof the cancer.\nThe type and size of the tumor.\nThe patient's general health.\nWhether the cancer has just been\ndiagnosed\nor has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nStages of Uterine Sarcoma\nKey Points\nAfter uterine sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body.\nUterine sarcoma may be diagnosed, staged, and treated in the same surgery.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nThe following FIGO staging system is used for leiomyosarcomas and endometrial stromal sarcomas:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nThe following FIGO staging system is used for adenosarcomas:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nUterine sarcoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nAfter uterine sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread within the\nuterus\nor to other\nparts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the\nstaging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know\nthe stage in order to plan treatment. The following\nprocedures may be used in the staging process:\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a\nblood\nsample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by\norgans\nand\ntissues\nin the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a\nsign\nof disease.\nCA 125\nassay\n:  A test that measures the level of CA 125 in the blood.  CA 125 is a substance released by\ncells\ninto the bloodstream.  An increased CA 125 level is sometimes a sign of cancer or other\ncondition\n.\nChest x-ray\n: An\nx-ray\nof the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nTransvaginal ultrasound\nexam\n: A procedure used to examine the\nvagina\n, uterus,\nfallopian tubes\n, and\nbladder\n. An\nultrasound transducer\n(probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (\nultrasound\n) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. The doctor can identify\ntumors\nby looking at the sonogram.\nEnlarge\nTransvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\nabdomen\nand\npelvis\n, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine.  A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues to show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nCystoscopy\n:  A procedure to look inside the bladder and\nurethra\nto check for\nabnormal\nareas.  A\ncystoscope\nis inserted through the urethra into the bladder.  A cystoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a\nlens\nfor viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor signs of cancer.\nEnlarge\nCystoscopy. A cystoscope (a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing) is inserted through the urethra into the bladder. Fluid is used to fill the bladder. The doctor looks at an image of the inner wall of the bladder on a computer monitor to check for abnormal areas.\nUterine sarcoma may be diagnosed, staged, and treated in the same surgery.\nSurgery\nis used to\ndiagnose\n, stage, and treat\nuterine sarcoma\n.  During this surgery, the  doctor removes as much of the cancer as possible. The following  procedures may be used to diagnose, stage, and treat uterine sarcoma:\nLaparotomy\n:  A\nsurgical\nprocedure in which an\nincision\n(cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. Sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease.\nAbdominal\nand\npelvic\nwashings:  A procedure in which a\nsaline\nsolution is placed into the  abdominal and pelvic body\ncavities\n. After a short time, the\nfluid\nis removed and  viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells.\nTotal abdominal hysterectomy\n: A surgical procedure to remove the uterus and\ncervix\nthrough a large incision (cut) in the abdomen.\nEnlarge\nHysterectomy. The uterus is surgically removed with or without other organs or tissues. In a total hysterectomy, the uterus and cervix are removed. In a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy, (a) the uterus plus one (unilateral) ovary and fallopian tube are removed; or (b) the uterus plus both (bilateral) ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed. In a radical hysterectomy, the uterus, cervix, both ovaries, both fallopian tubes, and nearby tissue are removed. These procedures are done using a low transverse incision or a vertical incision.\nBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n: Surgery to remove both\novaries\nand both fallopian tubes.\nLymphadenectomy\n: A surgical procedure in which\nlymph nodes\nare removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. For a\nregional lymphadenectomy\n, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. For a\nradical lymphadenectomy\n, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. This procedure is also called lymph node dissection.\nTreatment in addition to surgery may be given, as described in the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection of this summary.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  uterine sarcoma spreads to the\nlung\n, the cancer cells in the lung are actually uterine sarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic uterine sarcoma, not lung cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nThe following FIGO staging system is used for leiomyosarcomas and endometrial stromal sarcomas:\nStage I\nIn stage I, the\ntumor\nis found in the\nuterus\nonly. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB:\nIn stage IA, the tumor is 5\ncentimeters\nor smaller.\nIn stage IB, the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters.\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).\nStage II\nIn stage  II, the\ntumor\nhas spread beyond the\nuterus\nbut has not spread beyond the\npelvis\n. Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB:\nIn stage IIA, the tumor has  spread to the\novary\n,\nfallopian tube\n, or\nconnective tissues\naround the uterus.\nIn stage IIB, the tumor has spread to other\ntissues\nin the pelvis.\nStage III\nIn stage III, the\ntumor\nhas spread into\ntissues\nin the\nabdomen\n. Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC:\nIn stage IIIA, the tumor has spread to one site in the abdomen.\nIn stage IIIB, the tumor has spread to more than one site in the abdomen.\nIn stage IIIC, the tumor has spread to\nlymph nodes\nin the\npelvis\nand/or around the\nabdominal\naorta\n(the largest\nblood vessel\nin the abdomen).\nStage IV\nStage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB:\nIn stage IVA, the\ntumor\nhas spread into the\nbladder\nand/or the\nrectum\n.\nIn stage IVB, the tumor has spread to distant parts of the body.\nThe following FIGO staging system is used for adenosarcomas:\nStage I\nIn\nstage I\n, the\ntumor\nis found in the\nuterus\nonly. Stage I is divided into stages IA, IB, and IC:\nIn stage IA, the tumor  is found in the\nendometrium\nor\nendocervix\n(the inner part of the\ncervix\nthat forms a canal connecting the\nvagina\nto the uterus).\nIn stage IB, the tumor has spread halfway or less into the\nmyometrium\n(the muscular outer layer of the uterus).\nIn stage IC, the tumor has spread more than halfway into the myometrium.\nStage II\nIn\nstage II\n, the\ntumor\nhas spread outside the\nuterus\ninto the\npelvis\n. Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB:\nIn stage IIA, the tumor has  spread to the\novary\n,\nfallopian tube\n, or\nconnective tissues\naround the uterus.\nIn stage IIB, the tumor has spread to other\ntissues\nin the pelvis.\nStage III\nIn\nstage III\n, the\ntumor\nhas spread into\ntissues\nin the\nabdomen\n. Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC:\nIn stage IIIA, the tumor has spread to one site in the abdomen.\nIn stage IIIB, the tumor has spread to more than one site in the abdomen.\nIn stage IIIC, the tumor has spread to\nlymph nodes\nin the\npelvis\nand/or around the\nabdominal\naorta\n(the largest blood vessel in the abdomen).\nStage IV\nStage IV\nis divided into stages IVA and IVB:\nIn stage IVA, the\ntumor\nhas spread into the\nbladder\nand/or the\nrectum\n.\nIn stage IVB, the tumor has spread to distant parts of the body.\nUterine sarcoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nThe cancer may come back in the uterus, the pelvis, or in other parts of the body.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with uterine sarcoma.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nHormone therapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for uterine sarcoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with uterine sarcoma.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for  patients with\nuterine sarcoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery\nis the most common treatment for uterine sarcoma, as described in the\nStages of Uterine Sarcoma\nsection of this summary.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nafter surgery to kill any cancer\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given after the surgery,  to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer.\nThe way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and\nstage\nof the cancer being treated.  External and internal  radiation therapy are used to treat uterine sarcoma, and may also be used as\npalliative therapy\nto relieve\nsymptoms\nand improve\nquality of life\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nHormone therapy\nHormone therapy\nis a cancer treatment that removes\nhormones\nor blocks their action  and stops cancer cells from growing.  Hormones are substances produced by\nglands\nin the body and circulated in the bloodstream.  Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow.  If tests show the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (\nreceptors\n), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nInformation about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for uterine sarcoma may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Stage I Uterine Sarcoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nstage I leiomyosarcoma of the uterus\n,\nstage I endometrial stromal sarcoma\n, and\nstage I adenosarcoma of the uterus\nmay include the following:\nSurgery\n(\ntotal abdominal hysterectomy\n,\nbilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n, and\nlymphadenectomy\n).\nSurgery followed by\nradiation therapy\nto the\npelvis\n.\nSurgery followed by\nchemotherapy\n.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

These cells are very close to the\nnerve\nendings that receive the sensation of touch.\nMerkel cell carcinoma\n, also called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin or trabecular cancer, is a very rare type  of\nskin cancer\nthat  forms when Merkel cells grow out of control. Merkel cell carcinoma starts most often in areas of skin exposed to the sun, especially the head and neck, as well as the arms, legs, and\ntrunk\n.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the skin showing the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. Merkel cells are in the layer of basal cells at the deepest part of the epidermis and are connected to nerves.\nMerkel cell carcinoma tends to grow quickly and to\nmetastasize\n(spread) at an early\nstage\n. It   usually spreads first to nearby\nlymph nodes\nand then may spread to lymph nodes or skin in distant parts of the body,\nlungs\n,\nbrain\n, bones, or other\norgans\n.\nMerkel cell carcinoma is the second most common cause of skin cancer death after\nmelanoma\n.\nSun exposure and having a weak immune system can affect the risk of Merkel cell carcinoma.\nAnything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called \n         a\nrisk factor\n.  Having a risk factor does not mean that you will \n         get\ncancer\n; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will \n         not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for Merkel cell carcinoma include the following:\nBeing exposed to a lot of natural sunlight.\nBeing exposed to artificial sunlight, such as from tanning beds or\npsoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy\nfor\npsoriasis\n.\nHaving an\nimmune system\nweakened by disease, such as\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia\nor\nHIV\ninfection\n.\nTaking\ndrugs\nthat  make the immune system less active,  such as after an organ\ntransplant\n.\nHaving a\nhistory\nof other types of cancer.\nBeing older than 50 years, male, or White.\nMerkel cell carcinoma usually appears as a single painless lump on sun-exposed skin.\nThis and other changes in the skin may be caused by Merkel cell carcinoma or by other\nconditions\n. Check with your doctor if you see changes in your skin.\nMerkel cell carcinoma usually appears  on sun-exposed skin as a single lump that  is:\nFast-growing.\nPainless.\nFirm and dome-shaped or raised.\nRed or violet in color.\nTests and procedures that examine the skin  are used to diagnose Merkel cell carcinoma.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general\nsigns\nof health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient\u2019s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nFull-body skin exam\n: A doctor or\nnurse\nchecks the skin for bumps or spots that look\nabnormal\nin color, size, shape, or texture. The size, shape, and texture of the lymph nodes will also be checked.\nSkin\nbiopsy\n: The removal of skin\ncells\nor\ntissues\nso they can be viewed under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe stage of the cancer (the size of the\ntumor\nand whether it has spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body).\nWhere the cancer is in the body.\nWhether the cancer has just been\ndiagnosed\nor has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nThe patient's age and general health.\nPrognosis also depends on  how deeply  the tumor has grown into the skin.\nStages of Merkel Cell Carcinoma\nKey Points\nAfter Merkel cell carcinoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread  to other parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for Merkel cell carcinoma:\nStage 0 (carcinoma in situ)\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nMerkel cell carcinoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nAfter Merkel cell carcinoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread  to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread  to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the\norgans\nor\ntissues\nshow up more clearly.  A CT scan of the chest and\nabdomen\nmay be used to check for\nprimary\nsmall cell lung cancer\n, or to find\nMerkel cell carcinoma\nthat has spread. A CT scan of the head and neck may also be used to find Merkel cell carcinoma that has spread to the\nlymph nodes\n. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor\ncells\nin the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nLymph node biopsy\n: There are several types of lymph node biopsy used to stage Merkel cell carcinoma.\nSentinel lymph node biopsy\n:  The removal of the\nsentinel lymph node\nduring\nsurgery\n. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node in a group of lymph nodes to receive\nlymphatic drainage\nfrom the\nprimary tumor\n. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor.  A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor.  The substance or dye flows through the\nlymph\nducts\nto the lymph nodes.  The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed.   A\npathologist\nviews the tissue under a\nmicroscope\nto look for cancer cells.  If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes.\nEnlarge\nSentinel lymph node biopsy of the skin. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor (first panel). The injected material is detected visually and/or with a probe that detects radioactivity (middle panel). The sentinel nodes (the first lymph nodes to take up the material) are removed and checked for cancer cells (last panel).\nLymph node dissection\n: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for\nsigns\nof cancer. For a\nregional lymph node dissection\n, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. For a\nradical lymph node dissection\n, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.\nCore needle biopsy\n: A procedure to remove a sample of tissue using a wide needle.  A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.\nFine-needle aspiration biopsy\n: A procedure to remove a sample of tissue using a thin needle. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.\nImmunohistochemistry\n:  A\nlaboratory test\nthat uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient\u2019s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help\ndiagnose\ncancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  Merkel cell carcinoma spreads to the\nliver\n, the cancer cells in the liver are actually cancerous Merkel cells. The disease is metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, not liver cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for Merkel cell carcinoma:\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).\nStage 0 (carcinoma in situ)\nIn\nstage 0\n,\nabnormal\nMerkel cells\nare found in the top layer of skin. These abnormal\ncells\nmay become\ncancer\nand spread into nearby normal\ntissue\n.\nStage I\nIn\nstage I\n, the\ntumor\nis 2\ncentimeters\nor smaller.\nStage II\nStage II Merkel cell carcinoma\nis divided into stages IIA and IIB.\nIn stage IIA, the\ntumor\nis larger than 2\ncentimeters\n.\nIn stage IIB, the tumor has spread to nearby\nconnective tissue\n, muscle,\ncartilage\n, or bone.\nStage III\nStage III Merkel cell carcinoma\nis divided into stages IIIA and IIIB.\nIn stage IIIA, either of the following is found:\nthe\ntumor\nmay be any size and may have spread to nearby\nconnective tissue\n, muscle,\ncartilage\n, or bone. A\nlymph node\ncannot be felt during a\nphysical exam\nbut\ncancer\nis found in the lymph node by\nsentinel lymph node biopsy\nor after the lymph node is removed and checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor\nsigns\nof cancer; or\na swollen lymph node is felt during a physical exam and/or seen on an\nimaging test\n. When the lymph node is removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer, cancer is found in the lymph node. The place where the cancer began is not known.\nIn stage IIIB, the tumor may be any size and:\nmay have spread to nearby connective tissue, muscle, cartilage, or bone. A swollen lymph node is felt during a physical exam and/or seen on an imaging test. When the lymph node is removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer, cancer is found in the lymph node; or\ncancer is in a\nlymph vessel\nbetween the\nprimary tumor\nand lymph nodes that are near or far away. Cancer may have spread to lymph nodes.\nStage IV\nIn\nstage IV\n, the\ntumor\nhas spread to skin  that is not close to the\nprimary tumor\nor to other parts of the body, such as the\nliver\n,\nlung\n, bone, or\nbrain\n.\nMerkel cell carcinoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nThe cancer may come back in the skin,\nlymph nodes\n, or other parts of the body. It is common for Merkel cell carcinoma to\nrecur\n.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma.\nFour types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for Merkel cell carcinoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for patients with\nMerkel cell carcinoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nFour types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nOne or more of the following\nsurgical\nprocedures may be used to treat Merkel cell carcinoma:\nWide local excision\n: The cancer is cut from the skin along with  some of the\ntissue\naround it. A\nsentinel lymph node biopsy\nmay be done during the wide local excision procedure. If there is cancer in the\nlymph nodes\n, a\nlymph node dissection\nalso may be done.\nLymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed and  a sample of tissue is checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor\nsigns\nof cancer. For a\nregional lymph node dissection\n, some of the lymph nodes in the\ntumor\narea are removed; for a\nradical lymph node dissection\n, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nafter surgery to kill any cancer\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. It is used to treat Merkel cell carcinoma, and may also be used as\npalliative therapy\nto relieve\nsymptoms\nand improve\nquality of life\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient\u2019s\nimmune system\nto fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body\u2019s natural defenses against cancer.  This cancer treatment is a type of\nbiologic therapy\n.\nSome types of immune cells, such as\nT cells\n, and some cancer cells have certain\nproteins\n, called checkpoint proteins, on their surface that keep\nimmune responses\nin check. When cancer cells have large amounts of these proteins, they will not be attacked and killed by T cells.\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors\nblock these proteins and the ability of T cells to kill cancer cells is increased.\nThere are two types of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy:\nPD-1\nand\nPD-L1\ninhibitor therapy: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body's immune responses in check. PD-L1 is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other. This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells.\nPembrolizumab\n(a type of PD-1 inhibitor) and\navelumab\n(a type of PD-L1 inhibitor) are used to treat\nadvanced\nMerkel cell carcinoma.\nNivolumab\nis a type of PD-1 inhibitor being studied to treat advanced Merkel cell carcinoma.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nImmunotherapy uses the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.\nCTLA-4\ninhibitor therapy: CTLA-4 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body\u2019s immune responses in check. When CTLA-4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. CTLA-4 inhibitors attach to CTLA-4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells.\nIpilimumab\nis a type of CTLA-4 inhibitor being studied to treat advanced Merkel cell carcinoma.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as B7-1/B7-2 on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and CTLA-4 on T cells, help keep the body\u2019s immune responses in check. When the T-cell receptor (TCR) binds to antigen and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the APC and CD28 binds to B7-1/B7-2 on the APC, the T cell can be activated. However, the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 keeps the T cells in the inactive state so they are not able to kill tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) allows the T cells to be active and to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Merkel Cell Carcinoma\nfor more information.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nInformation about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for Merkel cell carcinoma may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Stage I and Stage II Merkel Cell Carcinoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nstage I\nand\nstage II\nMerkel cell carcinoma\nmay include the following:\nSurgery\nto remove the\ntumor\n, such as\nwide local excision\nwith or without\nlymph node dissection\n.\nRadiation therapy\nafter surgery.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

When retinoblastoma and a\nbrain tumor\noccur at the same time, it is called trilateral retinoblastoma. The brain tumor is usually diagnosed between 20 and 36 months of age. Regular\nscreening\nusing\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging) may be done for a child  thought to have heritable retinoblastoma or for a child with retinoblastoma in one eye and a family history of the disease.\nCT\n(computerized tomography)   scans are usually not used for routine screening in order to avoid exposing the child  to\nionizing radiation\n.\nHeritable retinoblastoma also increases the child's risk of other types of cancer such as\nlung cancer\n,\nbladder cancer\n, or\nmelanoma\nin later years. Regular\nfollow-up\nexams are  important.\nGenetic testing can determine whether a child has the heritable or nonheritable form of retinoblastoma.\nIt is not always clear from the\nfamily medical history\nwhether a\ncondition\nis inherited. Certain families may benefit from\ngenetic counseling\nand\ngenetic testing\n.\nGenetic counselors\nand other specially trained health professionals can help parents understand the following:\nTheir family medical history.\nTheir options for\nRB1\ngene testing\n.\nThe risk of retinoblastoma for the child and the child's brothers or sisters.\nThe risks and benefits of learning genetic information.\nGenetic counselors can also help people cope with their genetic testing results, including how to discuss the results with family members.\nOnce it is known  that the child has heritable retinoblastoma, other family members can be screened for the\nRB1\nmutation. For one specific mutation, the risk of retinoblastoma in a\nsibling\nmay depend partly on whether the mutation is inherited from the mother or from the father.\nSigns and symptoms of retinoblastoma  include \"white pupil\" and eyes that appear to be looking in different directions (crossed eyes).\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by retinoblastoma or by other\nconditions\n. Check with a doctor if your child has any of the  following:\nPupil\nof the eye that appears white instead of red when  light shines into it. This may be seen in flash photographs of the child.\nEnlarge\nClose-up photograph showing the eyes of a child with retinoblastoma. The pupil of the eye on the left side of the photo appears white compared to the pupil of the eye on the right side of the photo. A \"white pupil\" may be a sign of retinoblastoma.\nEyes  that appear to be looking in different directions (crossed eyes).\nPain or redness in the eye.\nInfection\naround the eye.\nEyeball that is larger than normal.\nColored part of the eye and pupil look cloudy.\nTests that examine the retina are used to diagnose retinoblastoma.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient\u2019s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. The doctor will ask if there is a family history of retinoblastoma.\nEye exam with\ndilated\npupil\n: An exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (opened wider)   with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the\nlens\nand pupil to the retina. The inside of the eye, including the retina and the optic nerve, is examined with a  light. In young children, this exam may be done under\nanesthesia\n.\nThere are several types of eye exams that are done with the pupil dilated:\nOphthalmoscopy\n: An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light.\nFluorescein\nangiography\n: A procedure to look at\nblood vessels\nand the flow of\nblood\ninside the eye.   An orange fluorescent\ndye\ncalled fluorescein is\ninjected\ninto a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and\nchoroid\nto find any blood vessels that are blocked or leaking.\nElectroretinography\n: An eye test that uses light and small\nelectrodes\nto study the retina (the light-detecting part of the eye). This test measures and records  the faint electrical signals given off  by the cells in  the retina when exposed to different types and amounts of light. It can be used to assess the function of the retina during and after treatment.\nRB1\ngene test\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for a change in the\nRB1\ngene.\nUltrasound\nexam of the eye\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes.   Eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is  placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a picture of the inside of the eye and the distance from the\ncornea\nto the retina is measured. The picture, called a\nsonogram\n, shows  on the screen of the ultrasound\nmonitor\n. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.\nMRI (magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the eye. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nRetinoblastoma can usually be diagnosed without a\nbiopsy\n.\nWhen retinoblastoma is in one eye, it sometimes forms in the other eye. Exams of the unaffected eye are done until it is known that the retinoblastoma is the nonheritable form.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nWhether the cancer is in one or both eyes.\nThe size and number of  tumors.\nWhether the tumor has spread to the area around the eye, to the brain, or to other parts of the body.\nThe age of the child.\nHow likely it is that vision can be saved in one or both eyes.\nWhether a second type of cancer has formed.\nWhether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nStages of Retinoblastoma\nKey Points\nAfter retinoblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out\n\t\t  if cancer cells have spread within the eye or to other parts of the body.\nThe International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS) may be used for staging retinoblastoma.\nStage 0\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nTreatment for retinoblastoma depends on whether it is intraocular (within the eye) or extraocular (outside the eye).\nIntraocular retinoblastoma\nExtraocular retinoblastoma\n(metastatic)\nTreatment for retinoblastoma also depends on whether the cancer has progressed or recurred.\nAfter retinoblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out\n\t\t  if cancer cells have spread within the eye or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread within the eye or\n\t\t  to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the staging\n\t\t  process determines whether\nretinoblastoma\nis only in the eye (\nintraocular\n) or has spread outside the eye (\nextraocular\n). It is important to know\nthe\nstage\nin order to plan treatment. The results of the\ntests and procedures\nused to\ndiagnose\ncancer are often also used to stage the disease.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\nbrain\n. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nBone scan\n:  A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing\ncells\n, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of\nradioactive\nmaterial is\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nand travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a\nscanner\nthat also takes a picture of the body.\n\nAreas of bone with cancer show up brighter in the picture because they take up more radioactive material than normal bone cells do.\nEnlarge\nBone scan.  A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the child's vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive material collects in the bones. As the child lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen.\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy\n: The removal of\nbone marrow\nand a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow under a\nmicroscope\nto look for\nsigns\nof cancer. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is done if the doctor thinks the cancer has spread outside of the eye.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child\u2019s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.\nLumbar puncture\n: A procedure used to collect\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) from the\nspinal column\n. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the\nspine\nand into the CSF around the\nspinal cord\nand removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord and sometimes it is also checked for a\ntumor marker\ncalled\nganglioside\nGD2. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\nThe International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS) may be used for staging retinoblastoma.\nThere are several\nstaging systems\nfor retinoblastoma. The IRSS stages are based on how much cancer remains after\nsurgery\nto remove the\ntumor\nand whether the cancer has spread.\nStage 0\nThe\ntumor\nis in the eye only. The eye has not been removed and the tumor was treated without\nsurgery\n.\nStage I\nThe\ntumor\nis in the eye only. The eye has been removed and no cancer\ncells\nremain.\nStage II\nThe\ntumor\nis in the eye only. The eye has been removed and cancer cells remain that can be seen only with a microscope.\nStage III\nStage\nIII is divided into stage IIIa and stage IIIb:\nIn stage IIIa, cancer has spread from the eye to\ntissues\naround the eye socket.\nIn stage IIIb, cancer has spread from the eye to\nlymph nodes\nnear the ear or in the neck.\nStage IV\nStage\nIV is divided into stage IVa and stage IVb:\nIn stage IVa, cancer has spread to one or more parts of the body, such as the bone or\nliver\n.\nIn stage IVb, cancer has spread to the brain or spinal cord. It also may have spread to other parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  retinoblastoma spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually retinoblastoma cells. The disease is metastatic retinoblastoma, not bone cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nTreatment for retinoblastoma depends on whether it is intraocular (within the eye) or extraocular (outside the eye).\nIntraocular retinoblastoma\nIn\nintraocular\nretinoblastoma\n,\ncancer\nis found in  one or both eyes and may be in the\nretina\nonly or may also be in other parts of the eye such as   the\nchoroid\n,\nciliary body\n,  or part of the\noptic nerve\n. Cancer has not spread to\ntissues\naround the outside of the eye or to other parts of the body.\nExtraocular retinoblastoma\n(metastatic)\nIn\nextraocular\nretinoblastoma\n,\ncancer\nhas spread beyond the eye. It may be found in\ntissues\naround the eye (orbital retinoblastoma), or it may have spread to the\ncentral nervous system\n(brain and spinal cord) or to other parts of the body such as the\nliver\n, bone,\nbone marrow\n, or\nlymph nodes\n.\nTreatment for retinoblastoma also depends on whether the cancer has progressed or recurred.\nProgressive\nretinoblastoma\nis cancer that continues to grow, spread or get worse. Progressive disease may be a sign that the cancer has become\nrefractory\nto treatment.\nRecurrent\nretinoblastoma is cancer that has\nrecurred\n(come back)  after it has been treated. The cancer may recur in the eye,  in\ntissues\naround the eye, or  in other places in the body, such as the liver, bone, bone marrow, or lymph nodes.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with retinoblastoma.\nChildren with retinoblastoma should have their treatment\n\t\t  planned by a team of      health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nSix types of standard treatment are used:\nCryotherapy\nThermotherapy\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue\nSurgery (enucleation)\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTargeted therapy\nTreatment for retinoblastoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with retinoblastoma.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\nretinoblastoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some\n\t\t  are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.\n\t\t  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help\n\t\t  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients\n\t\t  with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.\nBecause cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nChildren with retinoblastoma should have their treatment\n\t\t  planned by a team of      health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nThe goals of treatment are to save the child's life, to save vision and the eye, and to prevent serious\nside effects\n. Treatment will be overseen by a\npediatric oncologist\n, a doctor who specializes\n\t\t  in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist  works with\n\t\t  other\nhealth care providers\nwho are experts in treating children\n\t\t  with\neye cancer\nand who specialize\n\t\t  in certain areas of\nmedicine\n. These may include a\npediatric\nophthalmologist\n(children's eye doctor) who has a lot of experience in treating retinoblastoma and the following\nspecialists\n:\nPediatric surgeon\n.\nRadiation\n\t\t\t oncologist\n.\nPediatrician\n.\nPediatric nurse specialist\n.\nRehabilitation specialist\n.\nSocial worker\n.\nGeneticist\nor\ngenetic counselor\n.\nSix types of standard treatment are used:\nCryotherapy\nCryotherapy\nis the use of extreme cold to destroy\nabnormal\ntissue\n.  A small metal probe is cooled below freezing and placed on the surface of the eye near the\ntumor\n, which freezes and kills cancer\ncells\n. Cryotherapy is usually used to treat small retinoblastoma tumors that are located toward the front of the eye. This type of treatment is also called cryosurgery.\nThermotherapy\nThermotherapy\nis the use of  heat to destroy cancer\ncells\n.  Thermotherapy may be given using a\nlaser\nbeam aimed through the\ndilated\npupil\nor  onto the outside of the eyeball. Thermotherapy may be used alone for small\ntumors\nor combined with\nchemotherapy\nfor larger tumors. This treatment is a type of\nlaser therapy\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the\nstage\nof the cancer and where the cancer is in the body.\nThere are different types of chemotherapy:\nSystemic chemotherapy\n: When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body. Systemic chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumor (\nchemoreduction\n) and avoid surgery to remove the eye. After chemoreduction, other treatments may include\nradiation therapy\n, cryotherapy, laser therapy, or\nregional chemotherapy\n. However, extraorbital disease requires\nintensive chemotherapy\nand may include consolidation with\nhigh-dose chemotherapy\nand\nautologous stem cell transplantation\nwith or without radiation therapy.\nSystemic chemotherapy may also be given to kill any cancer cells that are left after the initial treatment or to kill cancer cells that are outside the eye. Treatment given after the initial treatment, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRegional chemotherapy: When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(\nintrathecal chemotherapy\n),  an\norgan\n(such as the eye), or a body\ncavity\n, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas. Several types of regional chemotherapy are used to treat retinoblastoma.\nOphthalmic artery infusion\nchemotherapy: Ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy carries anticancer drugs directly to the eye. A\ncatheter\nis put into an\nartery\nthat leads to the eye and the anticancer drug is given through the catheter.  After the drug is given, a small balloon may be inserted into the artery to block it and keep most of the anticancer drug trapped near the tumor. This type of chemotherapy may be given as the initial treatment when the tumor is in the eye only or when the tumor has not responded to other types of treatment. Ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy is given at special retinoblastoma treatment centers.\nIntravitreal chemotherapy\n: Intravitreal chemotherapy is the\ninjection\nof anticancer drugs directly into the\nvitreous humor\n(jelly-like substance) inside of the eye. It is used to treat cancer that has spread to the vitreous humor and has not responded to treatment or has come back after treatment.\nIntrathecal chemotherapy\n: Intrathecal chemotherapy is the injection of anticancer drugs directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF). It is used to treat cancer that has spread to the\nbrain\n.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Retinoblastoma\nfor more information.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.  There are two types of radiation therapy:\nExternal-beam radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nCertain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:\nIntensity-modulated radiation therapy\n(IMRT):  IMRT is a type of\n3-dimensional\n(3-D) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of  the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.\nProton beam radiation therapy\n: Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of\nprotons\n(tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells.  This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy tissue near a tumor.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer.  Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. This type of internal radiation therapy may include the following:\nPlaque radiotherapy\n: Radioactive seeds are attached to one side of a disk, called a plaque, and placed directly on the outside wall of the \n eye near the tumor.  The \nside of the plaque with the seeds on it faces the eyeball, aiming  radiation at \n the tumor. The plaque helps  protect other nearby tissue from the radiation.\nEnlarge\nPlaque radiotherapy of the eye.  A type of radiation therapy used to treat eye tumors. Radioactive seeds are placed on one side of a thin piece of metal (usually gold) called a plaque.  The plaque is sewn onto the outside wall of the eye.  The seeds give off radiation which kills the cancer. The plaque is removed at the end of treatment, which usually lasts for several days.\nWhether internal or external radiation therapy is given depends on the stage of the cancer being treated, where it is found in the body, and how the cancer responded to other treatments.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue\nHigh\ndoses\nof chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including\nblood\n-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell rescue\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. Extraorbital disease requires intensive chemotherapy and may include consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation with or without radiation therapy.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Retinoblastoma\nfor more information.\nSurgery (enucleation)\nEnucleation\nis\nsurgery\nto remove  the eye  and part of the\noptic nerve\n. A sample of the eye tissue that is removed will be checked under a\nmicroscope\nto see if there are any\nsigns\nthat the cancer is likely to spread to other parts of the body. This should be done by an experienced\npathologist\n, who is familiar with retinoblastoma and other diseases of the eye. Enucleation is done if there is little or no chance that vision can be saved and when the\ntumor\nis large, did not\nrespond\nto treatment, or comes back after treatment. The patient will be fitted for an artificial eye.\nClose follow-up is needed for 2 years or more  to check for signs of\nrecurrence\nin the area around the affected eye and to check the other eye.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.\nOncolytic virus therapy\n: This treatment uses a\nvirus\nthat infects and breaks down cancer cells but not normal cells. An oncolytic\nadenovirus\ntargeting the\nRB1\ngene\nis injected into the tumor and may have anticancer effects in retinoblastoma. Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of retinoblastoma that has\nprogressed\nor\nred\n.\nTreatment for retinoblastoma may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSide effects\nfrom cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called\nlate effects\n. Late effects of treatment for retinoblastoma may include the following:\nPhysical problems such as seeing or hearing problems.\nIf the eye is removed, there may be changes in the shape and size of the bone around the eye until an artificial eye is fitted. This is most likely to occur in children aged younger than 3 years.\nChanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.\nSecond cancers\n(new types of cancer), such as\nlung\nand\nbladder cancers\n,\nosteosarcoma\n,\nsoft tissue sarcoma\n, or\nmelanoma\n.\nThe following\nrisk factors\nmay increase the risk of having a second cancer:\nHaving the\nheritable\nform of retinoblastoma.\nPast treatment with radiation therapy, especially before age 1 year.\nHaving already had a previous second cancer.\nIt is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. Regular\nfollow-up\nby health professionals who are experts in\ndiagnosing\nand treating late effects is important. See the\nPDQ\nsummary on\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\nfor more information.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nIn retinoblastoma, new tumors may form for a few years after treatment. Regular eye exams are done to check for tumors in both eyes. Children with the heritable form of retinoblastoma will also have imaging tests to check whether cancer has spread to the brain.\nTreatment of Unilateral, Bilateral, and Cavitary Retinoblastoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nIf it is likely that the eye can be saved, treatment may include the following:\nSystemic chemotherapy\nor\nophthalmic artery infusion\nchemotherapy\n, with or without\nintravitreal chemotherapy\n, to shrink the\ntumor\n. This may be followed by one or more of the following:\nCryotherapy\n.\nThermotherapy\n.\nPlaque radiotherapy\n.\nExternal-beam radiation therapy\nfor\nbilateral\nintraocular\nretinoblastoma\nthat does not\nrespond\nto other treatments.\nIf the tumor is large and it is not likely that the eye can be saved, treatment may include the following:\nSurgery\n(\nenucleation\n). After surgery, systemic chemotherapy may be given to lower the risk that the\ncancer\nwill spread to other parts of the body.\nWhen retinoblastoma is in both eyes, the treatment for each eye may be different, depending on the size of the tumor and whether it is likely that the eye can be saved. The\ndose\nof systemic chemotherapy  is usually based on the eye that has more cancer.\nPatients with cavitary retinoblastoma respond well to treatment and have favorable long-term outcomes, similar to patients with noncavitary retinoblastoma.\nTreatment of Extraocular Retinoblastoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nextraocular\nretinoblastoma\n(cancer has spread to the area around the eye) may include the following:\nSystemic chemotherapy\nand\nexternal-beam radiation therapy\n.\nEnucleation\n.\nSystemic chemotherapy followed by\nsurgery\n(enucleation). External-beam radiation therapy and more\nchemotherapy\nmay be given after surgery.\nTreatment for extraocular retinoblastoma (cancer has spread to the\nbrain\n) may include the following:\nSystemic or\nintrathecal chemotherapy\nand external-beam radiation therapy to the brain and\nspinal cord\n.\nChemotherapy followed by\nhigh-dose chemotherapy\nwith\nstem cell rescue\nwith or without\nradiation therapy\n.\nIt is not clear whether treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue helps patients with extraocular retinoblastoma live longer.\nFor trilateral retinoblastoma (retinoblastoma and a\nbrain tumor\nthat occur at the same time), treatment may include the following:\nSystemic chemotherapy followed by surgery and high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue.\nSystemic chemotherapy followed by surgery and external-beam radiation therapy.\nFor retinoblastoma that has spread to other parts of the body, but not the brain, treatment may include the following:\nSystemic chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue and external-beam radiation therapy.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "context": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Acute Myeloid Leukemia\nKey Points\nAdult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes a large number of abnormal blood cells.\nLeukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nThere are different subtypes of AML.\nSmoking, previous chemotherapy treatment, and exposure to radiation may increase the risk of AML.\nSigns and symptoms of AML include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding.\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose AML.\nAfter AML has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\nSome people decide to get a second opinion.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nAdult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes a large number of abnormal blood cells.\nAML\nis a\ncancer\nof the blood and\nbone marrow\n.  It is the most common type of\nacute leukemia\nin adults. This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated.  AML is also called acute myelogenous leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the bone. The bone is made up of compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Compact bone makes up the outer layer of the bone. Spongy bone is found mostly at the ends of bones and contains red marrow. Bone marrow is found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. There are two types of bone marrow: red and yellow. Red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Yellow marrow is made mostly of fat.\nLeukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nNormally,\n\t\t  the bone marrow makes\nblood stem cells\n(immature cells) that    become mature blood cells over time. Blood stem cells mature into cells in the\nmyeloid\nline or the\nlymphoid\nline. AML occurs due to a problem with blood stem cell development in the myeloid line.\nMyeloid stem cells go through several stages of development in the bone marrow before fully maturing into:\nred blood cells\nthat carry oxygen and other substances to all\n\t\t\t tissues of the body\ngranulocytes\nand other types of\nwhite blood cells\nthat help the body\u2019s\nimmune system\nrespond to\ninfection\n, allergens, and\ninflammation\nplatelets\nthat  help stop bleeding by forming\nclots\nEnlarge\nBlood cell development. A blood stem cell goes through several steps to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell.\nIn AML, there is an increase in the number of immature white blood cells called myeloblasts (or myeloid\nblasts\n). The myeloblasts in AML are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells. As the number of these cells, also called\nleukemia cells\n, increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy platelets, red blood cells, and other white blood cells. This may lead to easy bleeding,\nanemia\n, and infection.\nThe leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body, including the\ncentral nervous system\n(CNS; brain and\nspinal cord\n), skin, and gums. Sometimes leukemia cells form a solid tumor called a\nmyeloid sarcoma\n. Myeloid sarcoma is also called extramedullary myeloid tumor, granulocytic sarcoma, or chloroma.\nThere are different subtypes of AML.\nMost AML\nsubtypes\nare based on how mature (developed) the cancer cells are at the time of diagnosis, and how different they are from normal cells.\nAcute  promyelocytic leukemia\n(APL) is a subtype of AML. This leukemia occurs when\ngenes\non\nchromosome\n15 switch places with some genes on\nchromosome 17\n, and an abnormal gene called\nPML\n::\nRARA\nis made. The\nPML\n::\nRARA\ngene sends a message that stops promyelocytes (a type of white blood cell) from maturing. Problems with severe bleeding and blood clots may occur. This is a serious health problem that needs treatment as soon as possible. APL usually occurs in middle-aged adults.\nSmoking, previous chemotherapy treatment, and exposure to radiation may increase the risk of AML.\nAML is caused by certain changes to the way blood stem cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. A risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors for AML, like smoking, can be changed. However, risk factors also include things people cannot change, like their genetics, getting older, and their health history.\nThere are many risk factors for AML, but many do not directly cause cancer. Instead, they increase the chance of\nDNA\ndamage in cells that may lead to AML. To learn more about how cancer develops, see\nWhat Is Cancer?\nHaving one or more of these risk factors does not mean that you will get AML. Many people with risk factors never develop AML, while others with no known risk factors do.\nPossible risk factors for AML include:\nbeing male\nolder age\nsmoking\nhaving had treatment with\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nin the past\nbeing exposed to\nradiation\nin the environment (such as nuclear radiation) or to the chemical\nbenzene\nhaving a\npersonal history\nof a blood disorder such as\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\nhaving certain\nsyndromes\nor\ninherited\ndisorders\nTalk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.\nSigns and symptoms of AML include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding.\nThe early\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nof AML may be like those caused by the flu or other common diseases. Check with your doctor if you have:\nweakness or feeling tired\nfever\ninfection\npaleness or loss of  normal skin color\nbleeding\nLess common signs or symptoms may be caused by clusters of leukemia cells in the CNS or\ntesticles\n, or a tumor of myeloid cells called a\nchloroma\n.\nSymptoms of acute leukemia often develop between 4 and 6 weeks before diagnosis.\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose AML.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nComplete blood\n\t\t\t count (CBC)\nis a\nlaboratory test\nin which a sample of blood is drawn and\n\t\t\t checked for:\nthe number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and\n\t\t\t\t  platelets\nthe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the substance in the blood that carries oxygen) in\n\t\t\t\t  the red blood cells\nthe amount of hematocrit (whole blood that is made up of red blood\n\t\t\t\t  cells)\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nPeripheral blood smear\nis a laboratory test in which a sample of blood is checked for   blast cells, the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells.\nFlow cytometry\nis a laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of the cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor (or other)\nmarkers\non the cell surface. The cells from a sample of a patient's blood, bone marrow, or other tissue are stained with a fluorescent dye, placed in a fluid, and then passed one at a time through a beam of light. The test results are based on how the cells that were stained with the fluorescent dye react to the beam of light. This test is used to help diagnose and manage certain types of cancers, such as leukemia and\nlymphoma\n.\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy\nis the removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After  a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle is inserted into the patient\u2019s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow   are removed for examination under a microscope.\nTumor\nbiopsy\nis the removal of cells or tissues from a lump using a needle. This may be done if the doctor suspects the leukemia cells may have formed a\nsolid tumor\ncalled a\nmyeloid sarcoma\n(also called a chloroma).\nCytogenetic analysis\nis a laboratory test in which the chromosomes of cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working. Other tests, such as\nfluorescence in situ hybridization\n(FISH), may also be done to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.\nMolecular testing\nis a laboratory test to check for certain genes,\nproteins\n, or other\nmolecules\nin a sample of blood or bone marrow. Molecular tests also check for certain changes in a gene or chromosome that may cause or affect the chance of developing AML. A molecular test may be used to help plan treatment, find out how well treatment is working, or make a\nprognosis\n.\nImmunophenotyping\nis a laboratory test that uses\nantibodies\nto identify cancer cells based on the types of\nantigens\nor\nmarkers\non the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of leukemia. For example, a cytochemistry study may test the cells in a sample of tissue using chemicals (dyes) to look for certain changes in the sample. A chemical may cause a color change in one type of leukemia cell but not in another type of leukemia cell.\nReverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction test (RT\u2013PCR)\nis a laboratory test in which the amount of a\ngenetic\nsubstance called\nmRNA\nmade by a specific gene is measured. An\nenzyme\ncalled reverse transcriptase is used to convert a specific piece of\nRNA\ninto a matching piece of\nDNA\n, which can be amplified (made in large numbers) by another enzyme called DNA polymerase. The amplified DNA copies help tell whether a specific mRNA is being made by a gene. RT\u2013PCR can be used to check the activation of certain genes that may indicate the presence of cancer cells. This test may be used to look for certain changes in a gene or chromosome, which may help diagnose cancer. This test is used to diagnose certain types of AML including acute  promyelocytic leukemia (APL).\nAfter AML has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used to determine if the leukemia has spread outside the blood and\nbone marrow\n:\nLumbar puncture\nis a procedure used to collect a sample of\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) from the\nspinal column\n.   This is done by placing a needle  between two bones in the\nspine\nand into the CSF around the\nspinal cord\nand removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for\nsigns\nthat\nleukemia cells\nhave spread to the brain and spinal cord.   This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\nEnlarge\nLumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\nis a procedure that uses a computer linked to an x-ray machine to make a series of detailed pictures of the\nabdomen\nfrom different angles. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.\nSome people decide to get a second opinion.\nYou may want to get a second opinion to confirm your AML diagnosis and treatment plan. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans. They may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another treatment approach, or provide more information about your cancer.\nTo learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see\nFinding Cancer Care\n. You can contact\nNCI\u2019s Cancer Information Service\nvia chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor, hospital, or getting a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, see\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor about Cancer\n.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options for AML depend on many factors:\nThe patient's age. Older age at diagnosis may be linked to lower\nremission\nrates and more\ncomplications\n.\nWhether the leukemia has spread to the CNS.\nWhether the patient has a\nsystemic\ninfection\nat the time of diagnosis.\nWhether the patient has a very high white blood cell count at the time of diagnosis.\nThe subtype of AML.\nWhether the patient received chemotherapy or radiation therapy in the past to treat a different cancer.\nWhether there is a history of a blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome.\nWhether the cancer has been treated before or\nrecurred\n(come back).\nIt is important that  AML be treated right away.\nStages of Acute Myeloid Leukemia\nKey Points\nThere is no standard staging system for acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\nThere is no standard staging system for acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\nThe extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages. Instead of stages, AML treatment is based on one or more of the following:\nthe\nsubtype\nof AML\nwhether the leukemia has spread outside the blood and bone marrow\nwhether the leukemia is newly diagnosed, in\nremission\n,\nrefractory\n, or\nrecurrent\nNewly diagnosed (untreated) AML\nIn untreated AML, the disease is newly diagnosed.  It  has not been treated except to relieve signs and\nsymptoms\nsuch as fever, bleeding, or pain, and the following are true:\nThe\ncomplete blood count\n(CBC) is abnormal.\nAt least 20% of the cells  in the bone marrow are\nblasts\n(leukemia cells) or there are certain\ngene\nchanges.\nThere are signs or symptoms of leukemia.\nAML in remission\nIn AML in\nremission\n, the disease has been treated and the following are true:\nThe CBC is normal.\nLess than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts (leukemia cells).\nThere are no signs or symptoms of leukemia in the brain and spinal cord  or elsewhere in the body.\nRefractory or recurrent AML\nAfter treatment with\nchemotherapy\n, some people with newly diagnosed AML will not go into remission. This is called\nrefractory cancer\n. In contrast, recurrent AML is cancer that has recurred\n\t\t(come back) after remission. The AML may come back in the\n\t\tblood or bone marrow.\nLearn more in\nRecurrent Cancer: When Cancer Comes Back\n. Information to help you cope and talk with your health care team can be found in the booklet\nWhen Cancer Returns\n.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for people with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\nThe treatment of AML usually has two phases.\nPatients receive supportive care for side effects of  treatment.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nTargeted therapy\nOther drug therapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for acute myeloid leukemia may cause side effects.\nFollow-up care may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for people with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\nDifferent types of treatments are available for people with AML. You and your cancer care team will work together to decide your treatment plan, which may include more than one type of treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as the phase of the cancer, your overall health, and your preferences. Your plan will include information about your cancer, the goals of treatment, your treatment options and the possible side effects, and the expected length of treatment.\nTalking with your cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect will be helpful. You\u2019ll want to learn what you need to do before treatment begins, how you\u2019ll feel while going through it, and what kind of help you will need. To learn more, see\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor about Treatment\n.\nThe treatment of AML usually has two phases.\nThere are two treatment phases of AML:\nRemission induction therapy\nis the first phase of treatment.  The goal is to kill the\nleukemia cells\nin the blood and\nbone marrow\n.  This puts the leukemia into\nremission\n.\nPostremission therapy\nis the second phase of treatment.  It begins after the leukemia is in remission.  The goal of postremission therapy  is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a\nrelapse\n.  This phase is also called remission continuation therapy.\nPatients receive supportive care for side effects of  treatment.\nPatients must be closely monitored during\ntreatment of AML.\nMyelosuppression\n, a condition which results in fewer\nred blood cells\n,\nwhite blood cells\n, and\nplatelets\n, is a\nside effect\nof both AML and treatment with\nchemotherapy\n.\nSupportive care\nduring remission induction therapy may  include:\nred blood cell and platelet\ntransfusions\nto replace blood cells destroyed by the cancer or its treatment\nantibiotics\nand\nantifungals\nto prevent or treat\ninfections\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy (also called chemo)  uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the\nsubtype\nof AML being treated and whether the leukemia cells have spread to the central nervous system (CNS; brain and spinal cord).\nSystemic chemotherapy is when chemotherapy drugs are taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a vein or muscle. When given this way, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body.\nSystemic chemotherapy drugs used to treat AML include:\nazacitidine\ncytarabine\ndaunorubicin\ndaunorubicin and cytarabine\ndecitabine\nidarubicin\nmidostaurin\nmitoxantrone\nCombinations of these drugs may be used. Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.\nIntrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat AML that has spread to the CNS (brain and spinal cord). Intrathecal chemotherapy is a method of placing chemotherapy directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This approach is used because the blood-brain barrier, a protective layer around the brain, can prevent chemotherapy drugs given by mouth or into a vein from reaching the CNS.\nCytarabine and\nmethotrexate\nare two chemotherapy drugs given as intrathecal chemotherapy to treat AML. These drugs can also be given systemically.\nEnlarge\nIntrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.\nTo learn more about how chemotherapy works, how it is given, common side effects, and more, see\nChemotherapy to Treat Cancer\nand\nChemotherapy and You: Support for People With Cancer\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. AML is sometimes treated with\nexternal radiation therapy\n. This type of radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nTotal-body irradiation\nsends radiation toward the whole body. It is a type of external radiation that may be used to prepare the body for a\nstem cell transplant\nwhen the leukemia has\nrecurred\n.\nLearn more about\nExternal Beam Radiation Therapy for Cancer\nand\nRadiation Therapy Side Effects\n.\nChemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nHigh doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cell transplant is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient or a\ndonor\nand are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy and/or total-body irradiation, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nEnlarge\nDonor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.\nLearn more about\nStem Cell Transplants in Cancer Treatment\n.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Your doctor may suggest\nbiomarker tests\nto help predict your response to certain targeted therapy drugs. Learn more about\nBiomarker Testing for Cancer\n.\nTargeted therapies used to treat AML include:\ngemtuzumab ozogamicin\nmidostaurin\nquizartinib\nLess-intensive targeted therapies in people who are unable or unwilling to receive other treatments  include:\nenasidenib\ngilteritinib\nglasdegib\nivosidenib\nvenetoclax\nLearn more about\nTargeted Therapy to Treat Cancer\n.\nOther drug therapy\nArsenic trioxide\nand\nall-trans retinoic acid\n(ATRA) are anticancer drugs that kill leukemia cells, stop the leukemia cells from dividing, or help the leukemia cells mature into white blood cells.  These drugs are used in the treatment of a subtype of AML called\nacute promyelocytic leukemia\n.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nA treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.

Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\n                \n                \n                    Six types of standard treatment are used:\n                    Surgery     Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for all stages of colon cancer. A doctor may remove the cancer using one of the following types of surgery:            -  Local excision: If the cancer is found at a very early stage, the doctor may remove it without cutting through the abdominal wall. Instead, the doctor may put a tube with a cutting tool through the rectum into the colon and cut the cancer out. This is called a local excision. If the cancer is found in a polyp (a small bulging area of tissue), the operation is called a polypectomy.     -  Resection of the colon with anastomosis: If the cancer is larger, the doctor will perform a partial colectomy (removing the cancer and a small amount of healthy tissue around it). The doctor may then perform an anastomosis (sewing the healthy parts of the colon together). The doctor will also usually remove lymph nodes near the colon and examine them under a microscope to see whether they contain cancer.     - Resection of the colon with colostomy: If the doctor is not able to sew the 2 ends of the colon back together, a stoma (an opening) is made on the outside of the body for waste to pass through. This procedure is called a colostomy. A bag is placed around the stoma to collect the waste. Sometimes the colostomy is needed only until the lower colon has healed, and then it can be reversed. If the doctor needs to remove the entire lower colon, however, the colostomy may be permanent.            Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiofrequency ablation      Radiofrequency ablation is the use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that kill cancer cells. Sometimes the probe is inserted directly through the skin and only local anesthesia is needed. In other cases, the probe is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. This is done in the hospital with general anesthesia.       Cryosurgery     Cryosurgery is a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).      Chemoembolization of the hepatic artery may be used to treat cancer that has spread to the liver. This involves blocking the hepatic artery (the main artery that supplies blood to the liver) and injecting anticancer drugs between the blockage and the liver. The livers arteries then deliver the drugs throughout the liver. Only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on what is used to block the artery. The liver continues to receive some blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine.    The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Colon and Rectal Cancer for more information.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.     Types of targeted therapies used in the treatment of colon cancer include the following:            -  Monoclonal antibodies: Monoclonal antibodies are made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.                  -  Bevacizumab and ramucirumab are types of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.       -  Cetuximab and panitumumab are types of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the surface of some types of cancer cells. This may stop cancer cells from growing and dividing.                -  Angiogenesis inhibitors: Angiogenesis inhibitors stop the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.                   -  Ziv-aflibercept is a vascular endothelial growth factor trap that blocks an enzyme needed for the growth of new blood vessels in tumors.       -  Regorafenib is used to treat colorectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and has not gotten better with other treatment. It blocks the action of certain proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor. This may help keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them. It may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.                      See Drugs Approved for Colon and Rectal Cancer for more information.\n                \n                \n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\n                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.\n                \n                \n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\n                \n                \n                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\n                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.\n                \n                \n                    Follow-up tests may be needed.\n                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.\n                \n\t        \t\n\t            \tTreatment Options for Colon Cancer\n\t\t\t            \n\t\t\t                \n\t\t\t                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)\n\t\t\t                    Treatment of stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) may include the following types of surgery:         -  Local excision or simple polypectomy.    -  Resection and anastomosis.

The\n\t\t  digestive system takes in nutrients (\nvitamins\n,\nminerals\n,\ncarbohydrates\n, fats,\nproteins\n, and water) from foods and helps pass waste\n\t\t  material out of the body. The digestive system is made up of the\nesophagus\n,\nstomach\n, and the\nsmall\nand\nlarge\n\t\t  intestines\n. The colon (large\nbowel\n) is the main part of the large intestine and is about 5 feet long. Together, the\nrectum\nand anal canal make up the last part of the large intestine and are about 6 to 8 inches long. The anal\n\t\t  canal ends at the anus (the opening\n\t\t  of the large intestine to the outside of the body).\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the lower gastrointestinal (digestive) system showing  the colon, rectum, and anus. Other organs that make up the digestive system are also shown.\nGastrointestinal stromal tumors\ncan occur in the colon. For more information, visit\nGastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Treatment\n.\nHealth history affects the risk of developing colon cancer.\nColorectal cancer is caused by certain changes to the way colorectal cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. There are many risk factors for colorectal cancer, but many do not directly cause cancer. Instead, they increase the chance of\nDNA\ndamage in cells that may lead to colorectal cancer. To learn more about how cancer develops, see\nWhat Is Cancer?\nA risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors for colorectal cancer, like smoking, can be changed. However, risk factors also include things you cannot change, like your genetics, getting older, and your\nfamily history\n. Learning about risk factors for colorectal cancer can help you make changes that might lower your risk of getting it.\nRisk factors for colorectal cancer include:\nhaving a\nfirst-degree relative\n(parent, sibling, or child) with a history of\ncolon\nor\nrectal cancer\nhaving a\npersonal history\nof colon, rectal, or\novarian cancer\nhaving a personal history of high-risk\nadenomas\n(colorectal\npolyps\nthat are 1 centimeter or larger in size or that have cells that look abnormal under a microscope)\nhaving\ninherited\nchanges in certain\ngenes\nthat increase the risk of\nfamilial adenomatous polyposis\n(FAP) or\nLynch syndrome\n(hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer)\nhaving a personal history of\nchronic\nulcerative colitis\nor\nCrohn disease\nfor 8 years or more\nhaving three or more alcoholic drinks per day\nsmoking cigarettes\nbeing Black\nhaving\nobesity\nOlder age is a main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.\nHaving one or more of these risk factors does not mean that you will get colorectal cancer. Many people with risk factors never develop colorectal cancer, while others with no known risk factors do. Talk with your doctor if you think you might be at increased risk.\nEnlarge\nPolyps in the colon.  Some polyps have a stalk and others do not.  Inset shows a photo of a polyp with a stalk.\nSigns of colon cancer include blood in the stool or a change in bowel habits.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by colon cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have:\nblood (either bright red or very dark) in the\nstool\na change in bowel\n\t\t\t habits\ndiarrhea\nconstipation\nfeeling that the bowel does not\n\t\t\t empty completely\nstools that are narrower or have a different shape than usual\ngeneral\nabdominal\ndiscomfort (frequent gas pains,\nbloating\n,\n\t\t\t fullness, or\ncramps\n)\nweight loss for no known reason\nfatigue\nvomiting\nTests that examine the colon and rectum are\n\t\t  used to diagnose colon cancer.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nDigital rectal exam\n(DRE)\nis an exam of the rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts a\nlubricated\n, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual.\nFecal occult\n\t\t\t blood test\n(FOBT)\nis a test to check stool (solid waste) for blood that can only be seen with a microscope.  A small sample of stool is placed on a special card or in a special container and returned to the doctor or laboratory for testing. Blood in the stool may be a sign of polyps (small pieces of bulging tissue), cancer, or other conditions.\nThere are two types of FOBTs:\nGuaiac FOBT\n: The sample of stool on the special card is tested with a chemical. If there is blood in the stool, the special card changes color.\nEnlarge\nA guaiac fecal occult blood test (FOBT) checks for occult (hidden) blood in the stool. Small samples of stool are placed on a special card and returned to a doctor or laboratory for testing.\nImmunochemical FOBT\n: A liquid is added to the stool sample. This mixture is\ninjected\ninto a machine that contains\nantibodies\nthat can detect blood in the stool. If there is blood in the stool, a line appears in a window in the machine. This test is also called fecal immunochemical test or FIT.\nEnlarge\nA fecal immunochemical test (FIT) checks for occult (hidden) blood in the stool. A small sample of stool is placed in a special collection tube or on special cards and returned to a doctor or laboratory for testing.\nSigmoidoscopy\nis a procedure to look inside the rectum and\nsigmoid (lower) colon\nfor polyps (small pieces of bulging tissue), abnormal areas, or cancer. A sigmoidoscope is inserted through the rectum into the sigmoid colon.  A sigmoidoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a  tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.\nEnlarge\nSigmoidoscopy.  A thin, lighted tube is inserted through the anus and rectum and into the lower part of the colon to look for abnormal areas.\nColonoscopy\nis a procedure that uses a colonoscope to look inside the rectum and colon for polyps (small pieces of bulging tissue), abnormal areas, or cancer. A colonoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a  tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.\nEnlarge\nColonoscopy.  A thin, lighted tube is inserted through the anus and rectum and into the colon to look for abnormal areas.\nVirtual colonoscopy\nis a procedure that uses a series of\nx-rays\ncalled\ncomputed tomography\nto make a series of pictures of the\n\t\t\t\tcolon. A computer puts the pictures together to create detailed images that may\n\t\t\t\tshow polyps and anything else that seems unusual on the inside surface of the colon. This test is also called colonography or CT colonography.\nBiopsy\nis the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. Tumor tissue that is removed during the biopsy may be checked to see if the patient is likely to have the\ngene\nmutation\nthat causes\nLynch syndrome\n(also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer).  This may help to plan treatment. Learn about the type of information that can be found in a pathologist's report about the cells or tissue removed during a biopsy at\nPathology Reports\n.\nCarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay\nis a test that measures the level of CEA in the blood. CEA is released into the bloodstream from both cancer cells and normal cells. When found in higher than normal amounts, it can be a sign of colon cancer or other conditions.\nDNA\nstool test\nchecks DNA in stool  cells for\ngenetic\nchanges that may be a sign of  colorectal cancer.\nAfter colon cancer has been diagnosed, imaging tests are done\n\t\t  to find out if cancer cells have spread within the colon or to other parts of\n\t\t  the body.\nThe process used to find out whether cancer has spread within the\n\t\t  colon or to other parts of the body\n\t\t  is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important\n\t\t  to know the stage  in\n\t\t  order to plan treatment.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\nuses a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\nabdomen\n,\npelvis\n,  or chest. The pictures are taken from different angles and are used to create 3-D views of tissues and organs.  A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\nuses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the colon. A substance called\ngadolinium\nis injected into the patient through a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\nuses a small amount of radioactive sugar (also called glucose) that is injected into a vein. Then a scanner rotates around the body to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. Because cancer cells often take up more glucose than normal cells, the pictures can be used to find cancer cells in the body.\nChest x-ray\nis a type of radiation that can go through the body and make pictures of the organs and bones inside the chest.\nSurgery\nis a procedure to remove the tumor and see how far it has spread through the colon.\nLymph node biopsy\nis the removal of all or part of a\nlymph node\n. A\npathologist\nviews the lymph node tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells. This may be done during surgery or by\nendoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration\nbiopsy.\nComplete blood\n\t\t\t count\n(CBC)\nis a procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and\n\t\t\t checked for the following:\nthe number of\nred blood cells\n,\nwhite blood cells\n, and\nplatelets\nthe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the substance in the blood that carries\noxygen\n) in\n\t\t\t\t  the red blood cells\nthe amount of hematocrit (whole blood that is made up of red blood cells)\nSome people decide to get a second opinion.\nYou may want to get a second opinion to confirm your colon cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans. They may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another treatment approach, or provide more information about your cancer.\nLearn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion at\nFinding Cancer Care\n. You can contact\nNCI\u2019s Cancer Information Service\nvia chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor, hospital, or getting a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, visit\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor About Cancer\n.\nCertain factors affect  prognosis\n\t\t  (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe prognosis\n\t\t  and treatment options depend on:\nthe\nstage\nof the cancer (whether it affects the inner lining of the colon only, or  has spread to\nlymph nodes\n, nearby organs, or other\n\t\t  places in the body)\nthe level of\nCEA\nin the blood\nwhether the cancer is related to certain genetic  changes in stool cells\nwhether the tumor has spread into or through the colon wall\nwhether the colon is blocked or has a hole in it\nwhether all of the tumor can be removed by surgery\nthe patient's general health\nwhether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back)\nStages of Colon Cancer\nKey Points\nThe following stages are used for colon cancer:\nStage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)\nStage I (also called stage 1) colon cancer\nStage II (also called stage 2) colon cancer\nStage III (also called stage 3) colon cancer\nStage IV (also called stage 4) colon cancer\nColon cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nCancer stage describes the extent of cancer in the body, such as the size of the tumor, whether it has spread, and how far it has spread from where it first formed. It is important to know the stage of the colon cancer to plan the best treatment.\nThere are several staging systems for cancer that describe the extent of the cancer. Colon cancer staging usually uses the\nTNM staging system\n. The cancer may be described by this staging system in your pathology report. Based on the TNM results, a stage (I, II, III, or IV, also written as 1, 2, 3, or 4) is assigned to your cancer. When talking to you about your diagnosis, your doctor may describe the cancer as one of these stages.\nLearn about\ntests to stage colon cancer\n. Learn more about\nCancer Staging\n.\nThe following stages are used for colon cancer:\nStage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)\nEnlarge\nStage 0 (colon carcinoma in situ). Abnormal cells are shown in the mucosa of the colon wall.\nIn stage 0 colon cancer,\nabnormal\ncells are found in the\nmucosa\n(innermost layer) of the colon wall. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma\n\t\t\t in situ.\nStage I (also called stage 1) colon cancer\nEnlarge\nStage I colon cancer. Cancer has spread from the mucosa of the colon wall to the submucosa or to the muscle layer.\nIn stage I colon cancer, cancer has formed in the\nmucosa\n(innermost layer) of the colon wall and has spread to the\nsubmucosa\n(layer of tissue next to the mucosa) or to the muscle layer of the colon wall.\nStage II (also called stage 2) colon cancer\nEnlarge\nStage II colon cancer. In stage IIA, cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the colon wall to the serosa. In stage IIB, cancer has spread through the serosa but has not spread to nearby organs. In stage IIC, cancer has spread through the serosa to nearby organs.\nStage II colon cancer is divided into stages IIA, IIB, and IIC.\nStage IIA: Cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the colon wall to the\nserosa\n(outermost layer) of the colon wall.\nStage IIB: Cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall to the tissue that lines the organs in the\nabdomen\n(visceral peritoneum).\nStage IIC: Cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall to nearby organs.\nStage III (also called stage 3) colon cancer\nStage III colon cancer is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC.\nEnlarge\nStage IIIA colon cancer. Cancer has spread through the mucosa of the colon wall to the submucosa and may have spread to the muscle layer, and has spread to one to three nearby lymph nodes or tissues near the lymph nodes. OR, cancer has spread through the mucosa to the submucosa and four to six nearby lymph nodes.\nIn stage IIIA, cancer has spread:\nthrough the\nmucosa\n(innermost layer) of the colon wall to the\nsubmucosa\n(layer of tissue next to the mucosa) or to the muscle layer of the colon wall. Cancer has spread to one to three nearby\nlymph nodes\n, or cancer cells have formed in tissue near the lymph nodes; or\nthrough the mucosa (innermost layer) of the colon wall to the submucosa (layer of tissue next to the mucosa). Cancer has spread to four to six nearby lymph nodes.\nEnlarge\nStage IIIB colon cancer. Cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the colon wall to the serosa or has spread through the serosa but not to nearby organs; cancer has spread to one to three nearby lymph nodes or to tissues near the lymph nodes. OR, cancer has spread to the muscle layer or to the serosa, and to four to six nearby lymph nodes. OR, cancer has spread through the mucosa to the submucosa and may have spread to the muscle layer; cancer has spread to seven or more nearby lymph nodes.\nIn stage IIIB, cancer has spread:\nthrough the muscle layer of the colon wall to the\nserosa\n(outermost layer) of the colon wall or has spread through the serosa to the tissue that lines the organs in the\nabdomen\n(visceral peritoneum). Cancer has spread to one to three nearby\nlymph nodes\n, or cancer cells have formed in tissue near the lymph nodes; or\nto the muscle layer or to the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall. Cancer has spread to four to six nearby lymph nodes; or\nthrough the\nmucosa\n(innermost layer) of the colon wall to the\nsubmucosa\n(layer of tissue next to the mucosa) or to the muscle layer of the colon wall. Cancer has spread to seven or more nearby lymph nodes.\nEnlarge\nStage IIIC colon cancer. Cancer has spread through the serosa of the colon wall but not to nearby organs; cancer has spread to four to six nearby lymph nodes. OR, cancer has spread through the muscle layer to the serosa or has spread through the serosa but not to nearby organs; cancer has spread to seven or more nearby lymph nodes. OR, cancer has spread through the serosa to nearby organs and to one or more nearby lymph nodes or to tissues near the lymph nodes.\nIn stage IIIC, cancer has spread:\nthrough the\nserosa\n(outermost layer) of the colon wall to the tissue that lines the organs in the\nabdomen\n(visceral peritoneum). Cancer has spread to four to six nearby\nlymph nodes\n; or\nthrough the muscle layer of the colon wall to the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall or has spread through the serosa to the tissue that lines the organs in the abdomen (visceral peritoneum). Cancer has spread to seven or more nearby lymph nodes; or\nthrough the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall to nearby organs. Cancer has spread to one or more nearby lymph nodes, or cancer cells have formed in tissue near the lymph nodes.\nStage IV (also called stage 4) colon cancer\nEnlarge\nStage IV colon cancer. The cancer has spread through the blood and lymph nodes to other parts of the body, such as the lung, liver, abdominal wall, or ovary (in females).\nStage IV colon cancer is divided into stages IVA, IVB, and IVC.\nStage IVA: Cancer has spread to one area or organ that is not near the colon, such as the\nliver\n,\nlung\n,\novary\n, or a distant\nlymph node\n.\nStage IVB: Cancer has spread to more than one area or organ that is not near the colon, such as the liver, lung, ovary, or a distant  lymph node.\nStage IVC: Cancer has spread to the tissue that lines the wall of the\nabdomen\nand may have spread to other areas or organs.\nStage IV colon cancer is also called metastatic colon cancer. Metastatic cancer happens when cancer cells travel through the\nlymphatic system\nor blood and form tumors in other parts of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if colon cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually colon cancer cells. The disease is called metastatic colon cancer, not liver cancer. Learn more in\nMetastatic Cancer: When Cancer Spreads\n.\nColon cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nRecurrent colon cancer is cancer that has come back after it has been treated. If colon cancer comes back, it may come back in the colon or in other parts of the body, such as the liver,\n\t\tlungs, or both. Tests will be done to help determine where the cancer has returned. The type of treatment for recurrent colon cancer will depend on where it has come back.\nLearn more in\nRecurrent Cancer: When Cancer Comes Back\n. Information to help you cope and talk with your health care team can be found in the booklet\nWhen Cancer Returns\n.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for people with colon\n\t\t  cancer.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nTargeted therapy\nImmunotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for colon cancer may cause side effects.\nFollow-up care may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for people with colon\n\t\t  cancer.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for colon cancer. You and your cancer care team will work together to decide your treatment plan, which may include more than one type of treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as the stage of the cancer, your overall health, and your preferences. Your plan will include information about your cancer, the goals of treatment, your treatment options and the possible side effects, and the expected length of treatment.\nTalking with your cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect will be helpful. You\u2019ll want to learn what you need to do before treatment begins, how you\u2019ll feel while going through it, and what kind of help you will need. To learn more, visit\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor About Treatment\n.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery is the most common treatment for all\nstages\nof colon cancer. The cancer is removed using one of the following types of surgery:\nPolypectomy: If the cancer is found in a polyp (a small piece of bulging tissue), the polyp is often removed during a\ncolonoscopy\n.\nLocal excision: If the\n\t\t\t\tcancer is found at a very early stage, the doctor may remove it without cutting\n\t\t\t\tthrough the\nabdominal\nwall. Instead,\n\t\t\t\tthe doctor may put a tube with a cutting tool through the rectum into the colon and cut the cancer out. This\n\t\t\t\tis called a local excision.\nResection of the colon with\nanastomosis\n: If the cancer is\n\t\t\t\tlarger, the doctor will perform a partial\ncolectomy\n(removing the cancer and a small amount\n\t\t\t\tof healthy tissue around it). The\n\t\t\t\tdoctor may then perform an anastomosis (sewing the healthy parts of the colon\n\t\t\t\ttogether). The doctor will also usually remove\nlymph nodes\nnear the colon and examine them under\n\t\t\t\ta microscope to see whether they contain cancer.\nEnlarge\nResection of the colon with anastomosis. Part of the colon containing the cancer and nearby healthy tissue is removed, and then the cut ends of the colon are joined.\nResection of the colon with\ncolostomy\n: If the doctor is not\n\t\t\t\table to sew the two ends of the colon back together, a\nstoma\n(opening) is made on the\n\t\t\t\toutside of the body for waste to pass through. This procedure is called a\n\t\t\t\tcolostomy. A bag is placed around the stoma to collect the waste. Sometimes the colostomy is\n\t\t\t\tneeded only until the lower colon has healed, and then it can be reversed. If\n\t\t\t\tthe doctor needs to remove the entire lower colon, however, the colostomy may\n\t\t\t\tbe permanent.\nEnlarge\nColon cancer surgery with colostomy.  Part of the colon containing the cancer and nearby healthy tissue is removed, a stoma is created, and a colostomy bag is attached to the stoma.\nRadiofrequency ablation: The use of a special probe   with tiny\nelectrodes\nthat kill cancer cells. Sometimes,   the probe is inserted directly through the skin, and only\nlocal anesthesia\nis needed. In other cases,   the probe is inserted through an\nincision\nin the\nabdomen\n. This is done in the hospital with\ngeneral anesthesia\n.\nCryosurgery\n: A treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy\nabnormal\ntissue. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy. Learn more about\nCryosurgery to Treat Cancer\n.\nRadiation therapy\nand/or\nchemotherapy\nmay be given before surgery to shrink the tumor, make it easier to remove the cancer, and help with\nbowel\ncontrol after surgery. Treatment given before surgery is called\nneoadjuvant therapy\n. After all the cancer that can be seen at the\n\t\t\t time of the surgery is removed, some patients may be   given radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer\n\t\t\t cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant\n\t\t\t therapy\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy (also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.\nSystemic chemotherapy\nis when chemotherapy drugs are taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a vein or muscle. When given this way, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body.  Systemic chemotherapy used to treat colon cancer includes:\ncapecitabine\nfluorouracil (5-FU)\nirinotecan\nleucovorin\n(a vitamin that improves the effectiveness of 5-FU)\noxaliplatin\ntrifluridine and tipiracil\nCombinations of these drugs may be used. Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.\nChemotherapy may also be combined with other kinds of drugs. For example, it might be combined with the targeted therapy drug\nbevacizumab\n,\ncetuximab\n, or\npanitumumab\n.\nRegional chemotherapy\nfor colon cancer is when drugs are placed directly into the hepatic artery (the main\nartery\nthat supplies blood to the liver) in a procedure called chemoembolization.  Chemoembolization of the hepatic artery may be used to treat cancer that has spread to the\nliver\n. This is done by blocking the hepatic artery  and injecting anticancer drugs between the blockage and the liver. The liver\u2019s arteries then carry the drugs into the liver. Only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on what is used to block the artery. The liver continues to receive some blood from the\nhepatic portal vein\n, which carries blood from the\nstomach\nand\nintestine\n.\nThe way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.\nLearn more about how chemotherapy works, how it is given, common side effects, and more at\nChemotherapy to Treat Cancer\nand\nChemotherapy and You: Support for People With Cancer\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.  Colon cancer is sometimes treated with two types of radiation therapy used to treat colon cancer:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer. Internal radiation therapy may be used to treat colon cancer that has spread to the liver.\nLearn more about\nRadiation Therapy to Treat Cancer\nand\nRadiation Therapy Side Effects\n.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Your doctor may suggest\nbiomarker tests\nto help predict your response to certain targeted therapy drugs. Learn more about\nBiomarker Testing for Cancer Treatment\n.\nTargeted therapies used to treat colon cancer include:\nbevacizumab\ncetuximab\nencorafenib\npanitumumab\nramucirumab\nregorafenib\nziv-aflibercept\nLearn more about\nTargeted Therapy to Treat Cancer\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy helps a person\u2019s immune system fight cancer.

Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nAfter treatment for colon cancer, a\nblood test\nto measure amounts of\ncarcinoembryonic antigen\n(a\n\t\t\t\tsubstance in the blood that may be increased when cancer is present) may be\n\t\t\t\tdone to see if the cancer has come back.\nTreatment of Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)\nTreatment of\nstage 0\nmay include the following types of\n\t\t  surgery:\nsimple\npolypectomy\nlocal\nexcision\nresection\nand\nanastomosis\n(when the      tumor is\n\t\t\t too large to remove by local excision)\nLearn more about these treatments in the\nTreatment Option Overview\n.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "hallucinated_answer": "The most common symptoms of colon cancer include a change in bowel habits, such as diarrhea or constipation; rectal bleeding or blood in the stool; abdominal pain or bloating; unintended weight loss; and fatigue. However, many early-stage colon cancers may not cause any noticeable symptoms, so regular screening is essential for early detection.\n\nColon cancer treatment options depend on the stage of the disease and may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these treatments. Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) usually involves local excision or resection and anastomosis. For stage I colon cancer, resection and anastomosis are typically recommended. Stage II colon cancer treatment also includes resection and anastomosis, while stage III colon cancer may involve surgery followed by chemotherapy or participation in clinical trials of new chemotherapy regimens. Stage IV and recurrent colon cancer treatments can include local excision, resection with or without anastomosis, surgery to remove parts of organs where the cancer has spread, palliative therapy like radiation or chemotherapy, chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody or angiogenesis inhibitor, and participation in clinical trials."

A weakened immune system is unable to fight\ninfection\nand disease. People with  HIV disease have an increased risk of infection and\nlymphoma\nor other types of\ncancer\n.  A person with HIV and certain types of infection or cancer, such as lymphoma, is\ndiagnosed\nas having AIDS. Sometimes, people are diagnosed with AIDS and\nAIDS-related\nlymphoma at the same time.  For information about AIDS and its treatment, see the\nAIDSinfo website\n.\nAIDS-related lymphoma is a type of \n\t\t  cancer that affects the\nlymph system\n. The lymph system is part of the immune system. It helps protect the body from infection and disease.\nThe lymph system is made up of the following:\nLymph\n: Colorless, watery\nfluid\nthat travels through the\nlymph vessels\nand carries\nT\nand\nB lymphocytes\n.\nLymphocytes\nare a type of\nwhite blood cell\n.\nLymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.\nLymph nodes\n: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are found along a network of lymph vessels throughout the body. Groups of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm,\nmediastinum\n,\nabdomen\n,\npelvis\n, and\ngroin\n.\nSpleen\n: An\norgan\nthat makes lymphocytes, stores\nred blood cells\nand lymphocytes, filters the\nblood\n, and destroys old blood\ncells\n. The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the\nstomach\n.\nThymus\n: An organ in which T lymphocytes mature and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the\nbreastbone\n.\nTonsils\n: Two small masses of lymph\ntissue\nat the back of the\nthroat\n. There is one tonsil on each side of the throat.\nBone marrow\n: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of certain bones, such as the hip bone and breastbone. White blood cells, red blood cells, and\nplatelets\nare made in the bone marrow.\nLymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the\nbrain\n, stomach,\nthyroid gland\n, and skin.\nSometimes AIDS-related lymphoma occurs outside the lymph nodes in the bone marrow,\nliver\n,\nmeninges\n(thin\nmembranes\nthat cover the brain) and\ngastrointestinal tract\n. Less often, it may occur in the\nanus\n, heart,\nbile duct\n,\ngingiva\n, and muscles.\nEnlarge\nThe lymph system is part of the body's immune system and is made up of tissues and organs that help protect the body from infection and disease. These include the tonsils, adenoids (not shown), thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes. Lymph tissue is also found in many other parts of the body, including the small intestine.\nThere are  many different types of \n\t\t  lymphoma.\nLymphomas are divided into two general types:\nHodgkin lymphoma\n.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\n.\nBoth  non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma may occur in patients with AIDS, but non-Hodgkin lymphoma is more common. When a person with AIDS has non-Hodgkin lymphoma, it is called AIDS-related lymphoma. When AIDS-related lymphoma occurs in the\ncentral nervous system\n(CNS), it is called AIDS-related\nprimary CNS lymphoma\n.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphomas are grouped by the way their cells look under a\nmicroscope\n. They may be\nindolent\n(slow-growing) or\naggressive\n(fast-growing). AIDS-related lymphomas are  aggressive. There are  two main types of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma:\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\n(including\nB-cell\nimmunoblastic lymphoma).\nBurkitt\nor Burkitt-like lymphoma.\nFor more  information about lymphoma or AIDS-related cancers, see the following:\nAdult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment\nChildhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment\nPrimary CNS Lymphoma Treatment\nKaposi Sarcoma Treatment\nSigns of AIDS-related lymphoma  include weight loss, fever, and drenching night sweats.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by AIDS-related lymphoma or by other\nconditions\n. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:\nWeight loss or\nfever\nfor no known reason.\nDrenching night sweats.\nPainless, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, chest, underarm, or \n\t\t\t  groin.\nA feeling of fullness below the ribs.\nTests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to\n\t\t  diagnose AIDS-related  lymphoma.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient\u2019s health, including\nfever\n, drenching night sweats, and weight loss, health habits, and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\n: A  procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries\noxygen\n) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nLDH\ntest\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount  of lactic dehydrogenase. An increased amount of LDH in the blood may be a sign of tissue damage, lymphoma, or other diseases.\nHepatitis B\nand\nhepatitis C\ntest\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked to measure the amounts of hepatitis B virus-specific\nantigens\nand/or\nantibodies\nand the amounts of hepatitis C virus-specific antibodies. These antigens or antibodies are called\nmarkers\n. Different markers or combinations of markers are used to determine whether a patient has a hepatitis B or C infection, has had a prior infection or\nvaccination\n, or is susceptible to infection.\nHIV test\n: A test to measure the level of HIV antibodies in a sample of blood.  Antibodies are made by the body when it is invaded by a\nforeign\nsubstance. A high level of HIV antibodies may mean the body has been infected with HIV.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n:\n\t\t  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and\nlymph nodes\n, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nPET scan\n(positron\n\t\t  emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor\ncells in the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\n: The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After  a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle is inserted into the patient\u2019s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow   are removed for examination under a microscope.\nLymph node biopsy\n: The\n\t\t\t removal of all or part of a  lymph node. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. One of the following  types of biopsies  may be done:\nExcisional\n\t\t\t\t  biopsy\n: The removal of an entire lymph node.\nIncisional biopsy\n: The removal of part of a lymph node.\nCore biopsy\n: The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle.\nOther areas of the body, such as the liver,\nlung\n, bone, bone marrow, and brain, may also have a sample of tissue removed and checked by a pathologist for signs of cancer.\nIf cancer is found, the following tests may be done to study the cancer cells:\nImmunohistochemistry\n:   A\nlaboratory test\nthat uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of a patient\u2019s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A laboratory test in which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nFISH\n(fluorescence in situ hybridization)\n: A laboratory test used to look at and count\ngenes\nor chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of\nDNA\nthat contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient\u2019s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.\nImmunophenotyping\n: A laboratory test that uses antibodies to identify cancer cells based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of lymphoma.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on\n\t\t  the following:\nThe\nstage\nof the cancer.\nThe age of the patient.\nThe number of\nCD4 lymphocytes\n(a type of white blood cell) in the blood.\nThe number of places in the body lymphoma is found outside the lymph system.\nWhether the patient has a history of\nintravenous\n(IV)\ndrug use\n.\nThe patient's ability to carry out\nregular daily activities\n.\nStages of AIDS-Related Lymphoma\nKey Points\nAfter AIDS-related lymphoma  has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out\n\t\t  if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nThe following stages are used for AIDS-related lymphoma:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nFor treatment, AIDS-related lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body, as follows:\nPeripheral/systemic lymphoma\nPrimary CNS lymphoma\nAfter AIDS-related lymphoma  has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out\n\t\t  if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\ncells\nhave spread within the\nlymph system\nor\n\t\t  to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the\n\t\t  staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know the stage  in order to plan treatment, but\nAIDS-related\nlymphoma\nis usually\nadvanced\nwhen it is\ndiagnosed\n.\nThe following tests and\n\t\t  procedures may be used to find out if the cancer has spread:\nMRI\n(magnetic\n\t\t  resonance imaging) with\ngadolinium\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\nbrain\nand\nspinal cord\n. A substance called gadolinium is\ninjected\ninto the patient through a\nvein\n. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nLumbar puncture\n:\n\t\t\t\tA procedure used to collect\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) from the\nspinal column\n.   This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the\nspine\nand into the CSF around the\nspinal cord\nand removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor\nsigns\nthat the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. The sample may also be checked for\nEpstein-Barr virus\n. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\nEnlarge\nLumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for AIDS-related lymphoma:\nStage I\nEnlarge\nStage I adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in one or more lymph nodes in a group of lymph nodes or, in rare cases, cancer is found in the Waldeyer\u2019s ring, thymus, or spleen. In stage IE (not shown), cancer has spread to one area outside the lymph system.\nStage I AIDS-related lymphoma\nis divided into stages I and IE.\nIn stage I,\ncancer\nis found in one of the following places in the\nlymph system\n:\nOne or more\nlymph nodes\nin a group of lymph nodes.\nWaldeyer's ring\n.\nThymus\n.\nSpleen\n.\nIn stage IE, cancer is found in one area outside the lymph system.\nStage II\nStage II AIDS-related lymphoma\nis divided into stages II and IIE.\nIn stage II,\ncancer\nis found in two or more groups of\nlymph nodes\nthat are either above the\ndiaphragm\nor below the diaphragm.\nEnlarge\nStage II adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are either above the diaphragm or below the diaphragm.\nIn stage IIE, cancer has spread from a group of lymph nodes to a nearby area that is outside the\nlymph system\n. Cancer may have spread to other lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm.\nEnlarge\nStage IIE adult lymphoma. Cancer has spread from a group of lymph nodes to a nearby area that is outside the lymph system. Cancer may have spread to other lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm.\nIn stage II, the term\nbulky disease\nrefers to a larger\ntumor\nmass. The size of the tumor mass that is referred to as bulky disease varies based on the type of lymphoma.\nStage III\nEnlarge\nStage III adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in groups of lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm; or in a group of lymph nodes above the diaphragm and in the spleen.\nIn\nstage III AIDS-related lymphoma\n,\ncancer\nis found:\nin groups of\nlymph nodes\nboth above and below the\ndiaphragm\n; or\nin lymph nodes above the diaphragm and in the\nspleen\n.\nStage IV\nEnlarge\nStage IV adult lymphoma. Cancer (a) has spread throughout one or more organs outside the lymph system; or (b) is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are either above the diaphragm or below the diaphragm and in one organ that is outside the lymph system and not near the affected lymph nodes; or (c) is found in groups of lymph nodes above the diaphragm and below the diaphragm and in any organ that is outside the lymph system; or (d) is found in the liver, bone marrow, more than one place in the lung, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The cancer has not spread directly into the liver, bone marrow, lung, or CSF from nearby lymph nodes.\nIn\nstage IV AIDS-related lymphoma\n,\ncancer\n:\nhas spread throughout one or more\norgans\noutside the\nlymph system\n; or\nis found in two or more groups of\nlymph nodes\nthat are either above the\ndiaphragm\nor below the diaphragm and in one organ that is outside the lymph system and not near the affected lymph nodes; or\nis found in groups of lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm and in any organ that is outside the lymph system; or\nis found in the\nliver\n,\nbone marrow\n, more than one place in the\nlung\n, or\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF). The cancer has not spread directly into the liver, bone marrow, lung, or CSF from nearby lymph nodes.\nPatients who are\ninfected\nwith the Epstein-Barr virus or whose AIDS-related lymphoma affects the\nbone marrow\nhave an increased risk of the cancer spreading to the\ncentral nervous system\n(CNS).\nFor treatment, AIDS-related lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body, as follows:\nPeripheral/systemic lymphoma\nLymphoma\nthat  starts in the\nlymph system\nor elsewhere in the body, other than the brain, is called peripheral/systemic lymphoma. It may  spread  throughout the body, including to the brain or\nbone marrow\n. It is often diagnosed in an advanced stage.\nPrimary CNS lymphoma\nPrimary CNS\nlymphoma\nstarts in the\ncentral nervous system\n(brain and spinal cord). It is linked to the Epstein-Barr virus.\nLymphoma\nthat starts somewhere else in the body and spreads to the central nervous system is not primary CNS lymphoma.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with AIDS-related lymphoma.\nTreatment of AIDS-related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for AIDS.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nTargeted therapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for AIDS-related lymphoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with AIDS-related lymphoma.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\nAIDS-related\nlymphoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some\n\t\t  are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.\n\t\t  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help\n\t\t  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients\n\t\t  with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nTreatment of AIDS-related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for AIDS.\nPatients with\nAIDS\nhave weakened\nimmune systems\nand treatment can cause the immune system to become even weaker. For this reason, treating patients who have AIDS-related lymphoma is difficult and some patients may be treated with lower\ndoses\nof\ndrugs\nthan lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS.\nHighly active antiretroviral therapy\n(HAART)    is used to lessen the damage to the immune system caused by\nHIV\n. Treatment with HAART may allow some patients with AIDS-related lymphoma to safely receive anticancer drugs in standard or higher doses. In  these patients, treatment  may work as well as it does in lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS.\nMedicine\nto prevent and treat\ninfections\n, which can be serious, is also used.\nFor more information about AIDS and its treatment, see the\nAIDSinfo website\n.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer\ncells\n, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(\nintrathecal chemotherapy\n), an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the\nabdomen\n, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n).\nCombination chemotherapy\nis treatment using more than one anticancer drug.\nIntrathecal chemotherapy may be used in patients who are more likely to have lymphoma in the\ncentral nervous system\n(CNS).\nEnlarge\nIntrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.\nChemotherapy is used in the treatment of AIDS-related peripheral/\nsystemic\nlymphoma. It is not yet known whether it is best to give HAART at the same time as chemotherapy or after chemotherapy ends.\nColony-stimulating factors\nare sometimes given together with chemotherapy. This helps lessen the\nside effects\nchemotherapy may have on the\nbone marrow\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nHigh doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including\nblood\n-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell transplant\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses\ndrugs\nor other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.\nMonoclonal antibodies\n: Monoclonal antibodies are immune system proteins made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these\nantibodies\ncan attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. These may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.\nRituximab\nis used in the treatment of AIDS-related peripheral/systemic lymphoma.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body\u2019s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nInformation about  clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for AIDS-related lymphoma may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of AIDS-Related Peripheral/Systemic Lymphoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nAIDS-related\nperipheral/\nsystemic\nlymphoma\nmay include the following:\nCombination chemotherapy\nwith or without\ntargeted therapy\n.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy\nand\nstem cell transplant\n, for lymphoma that has not\nresponded\nto treatment or has come back.\nIntrathecal chemotherapy\nfor lymphoma that is likely to  spread to the\ncentral nervous system\n(CNS).\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "hallucinated_answer": "The outlook for AIDS-related lymphoma depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the number of CD4 lymphocytes in the blood, and the patient's ability to carry out regular daily activities. Other factors that may affect prognosis and treatment options include the age of the patient, whether the patient has a history of intravenous drug use, and the number of places outside the lymph system where lymphoma is found."

Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\n                \n                \n                    Eight types of treatment are used:\n                    Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Multiple Myeloma and Other Plasma Cell Neoplasms for more information.       Other drug therapy     Corticosteroids are steroids that have antitumor effects in multiple myeloma.        Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Several types of targeted therapy may be used to treat multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.     Proteasome inhibitor therapy is a type of targeted therapy that blocks the action of proteasomes in cancer cells and may prevent the growth of tumors. Bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib, daratumumab, and elotuzumab are proteasome inhibitors used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.     Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor therapy is a type of targeted therapy that blocks enzymes needed for cell division and may stop the growth of cancer cells. Panobinostat is an HDAC inhibitor used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.    See Drugs Approved for Multiple Myeloma and Other Plasma Cell Neoplasms for more information.       High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant    This treatment is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient (autologous transplant) or a donor (allogeneic transplant) and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.           Biologic therapy     Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.     Immunomodulators are a type of biologic therapy. Thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide are immunomodulators used to treat multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.     Interferon is a type of biologic therapy. It affects the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth.     See Drugs Approved for Multiple Myeloma and Other Plasma Cell Neoplasms for more information.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat plasma cell neoplasms.       Surgery     Surgery to remove the tumor may be done and is usually followed by radiation therapy. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Watchful waiting     Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.\n                \n                \n                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\n                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     New combinations of therapies     Clinical trials are studying different combinations of biologic therapy, chemotherapy, steroid therapy, and drugs. New treatment regimens using thalidomide or lenalidomide are also being studied.\n                \n                \n                    Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment.\n                    This therapy controls problems or side effects caused by the disease or its treatment, and improves quality of life. Supportive care is given to treat problems caused by multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.     Supportive care may include the following:          -  Plasmapheresis: If the blood becomes thick with extra antibody proteins and interferes with circulation, plasmapheresis is done to remove extra plasma and antibody proteins from the blood. In this procedure blood is removed from the patient and sent through a machine that separates the plasma (the liquid part of the blood) from the blood cells. The patient's plasma contains the unneeded antibodies and is not returned to the patient. The normal blood cells are returned to the bloodstream along with donated plasma or a plasma replacement. Plasmapheresis does not keep new antibodies from forming.     -  High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant: If amyloidosis occurs, treatment may include high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant using the patient's own stem cells.    -  Biologic therapy: Biologic therapy with thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide is given to treat amyloidosis.    -  Targeted therapy: Targeted therapy with proteasome inhibitors is given to treat amyloidosis.    -  Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy is given for bone lesions of the spine.    -  Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is given to reduce back pain from osteoporosis or compression fractures of the spine.    -  Bisphosphonate therapy: Bisphosphonate therapy is given to slow bone loss and reduce bone pain. See the following PDQ summaries for more information on bisphosphonates and problems related to their use:               - Cancer Pain      - Oral Complications of Chemotherapy and Head/Neck Radiation\n                \n                \n                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\n                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.

When signs or symptoms appear, the treatment of multiple myeloma may be done in phases:         -   Induction therapy : This is the first phase of treatment. Its goal is to reduce the amount of disease, and may include one or more of the following:               -  Corticosteroid therapy.      -  Biologic therapy with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide therapy.      -  Targeted therapy with proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib, daratumumab, and elotuzumab).      -  Chemotherapy.      -  Histone deacetylase inhibitor therapy with panobinostat.      - A clinical trial of different combinations of treatment.             -   Consolidation chemotherapy : This is the second phase of treatment. Treatment in the consolidation phase is to kill any remaining cancer cells. High-dose chemotherapy is followed by either:               - one autologous stem cell transplant, in which the patient's stem cells from the blood or bone marrow are used; or      - two autologous stem cell transplants followed by an autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant, in which the patient receives stem cells from the blood or bone marrow of a donor; or      - one allogeneic stem cell transplant.             -   Maintenance therapy : After the initial treatment, maintenance therapy is often given to help keep the disease in remission for a longer time. Several types of treatment are being studied for this use, including the following:               - Chemotherapy.      -  Biologic therapy with interferon.      - Corticosteroid therapy.      - Lenalidomide therapy.      - Targeted therapy with a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).

        "context": "Plasma Cell Neoplasms (Including Multiple Myeloma)   Treatment (PDQ\u00ae)\u2013Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Plasma Cell  Neoplasms\nKey Points\nPlasma cell neoplasms are diseases in which the body makes too many plasma cells.\nPlasma cell neoplasms can be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).\nThere are several types of plasma cell neoplasms.\nMonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)\nPlasmacytoma\nMultiple myeloma\nMultiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms may cause a condition called amyloidosis.\nAge can affect the risk of plasma cell neoplasms.\nTests that examine the blood, bone marrow, and urine are used to diagnose multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nPlasma cell neoplasms are diseases in which the body makes too many plasma cells.\nPlasma cells\ndevelop from\nB lymphocytes\n(B cells), a type of\nwhite blood cell\nthat is made in the\nbone marrow\n. Normally, when\nbacteria\nor\nviruses\nenter the body, some of the\nB cells\nwill change into plasma cells.  The plasma cells make\nantibodies\nto fight bacteria and viruses, to stop\ninfection\nand disease.\nEnlarge\nMultiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma cells are abnormal plasma cells (a type of white blood cell) that build up in the bone marrow and form tumors in many bones of the body. Normal plasma cells make antibodies to help the body fight infection and disease. As the number of multiple myeloma cells increases, more antibodies are made. This can cause the blood to thicken and keep the bone marrow from making enough healthy blood cells. Multiple myeloma cells also damage and weaken the bone.\nPlasma cell\nneoplasms\nare diseases in which\nabnormal\nplasma cells form\ntumors\nin the bones or soft\ntissues\nof the body. The plasma cells also make an antibody\nprotein\n, called\nM protein\n, that is not needed by the body and does not help fight infection. These antibody proteins build up in the bone marrow and can cause the\nblood\nto thicken or can damage the\nkidneys\n.\nPlasma cell neoplasms can be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).\nMonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance\n(MGUS) is not cancer but can become\ncancer\n.\nThe following types of plasma cell neoplasms are cancer:\nLymphoplasmacytic lymphoma\n(also called Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia).  For more information, see\nNon-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment\n.\nPlasmacytoma\n.\nMultiple myeloma\n.\nThere are several types of plasma cell neoplasms.\nPlasma cell neoplasms include the following:\nMonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)\nIn this type of\nplasma cell\nneoplasm\n, less than 10% of the\nbone marrow\nis made up of abnormal\nplasma cells\nand there is no\ncancer\n. The abnormal plasma cells make\nM protein\n, which is sometimes found during a routine\nblood\nor\nurine test\n. In most patients, the amount of M protein stays the same and there are no\nsigns\n,\nsymptoms\n, or health problems.\nIn some patients,\nMGUS\nmay later become a more serious\ncondition\n, such as\namyloidosis\n, or cause problems with the kidneys, heart, or\nnerves\n.  MGUS can also become cancer, such as\nmultiple myeloma\n,\nlymphoplasmacytic lymphoma\n, or\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia\n.\nPlasmacytoma\nIn this type of\nplasma cell\nneoplasm\n, the\nabnormal\nplasma cells (\nmyeloma\ncells\n) are in one place and form one\ntumor\n, called a\nplasmacytoma\n. Sometimes plasmacytoma can be\ncured\n. There are two types of plasmacytoma.\nIn isolated plasmacytoma  of bone, one\nplasma cell tumor\nis found in the bone, less than 10% of the\nbone marrow\nis made up of plasma cells, and there are no other\nsigns\nof\ncancer\n. Plasmacytoma of the bone often becomes\nmultiple myeloma\n.\nIn extramedullary plasmacytoma, one plasma cell tumor is found in\nsoft tissue\nbut not in the bone or the bone marrow. Extramedullary plasmacytomas commonly form in\ntissues\nof the\nthroat\n,\ntonsil\n,  and\nparanasal sinuses\n.\nSigns and\nsymptoms\ndepend on where the tumor is.\nIn bone, the plasmacytoma may cause pain or broken bones.\nIn soft tissue, the tumor may press on nearby areas and cause pain or other problems. For example, a plasmacytoma in the throat can make it hard to swallow.\nMultiple myeloma\nIn\nmultiple myeloma\n,\nabnormal\nplasma cells\n(\nmyeloma\ncells\n) build up in the\nbone marrow\nand form\ntumors\nin many bones  of the body. These tumors may keep the bone marrow from making enough healthy\nblood\ncells. Normally, the bone marrow makes\nstem cells\n(immature cells) that become three types of mature blood cells:\nRed blood cells\nthat carry\noxygen\nand other substances to all\ntissues\nof the body.\nWhite blood cells\nthat fight\ninfection\nand disease.\nPlatelets\nthat form\nblood clots\nto help prevent bleeding.\nAs the number of myeloma cells increases, fewer red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are made. The myeloma cells also damage and weaken the bone.\nSometimes multiple myeloma does not cause any\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\n. This is called\nsmoldering multiple myeloma\n. It may be found when a\nblood\nor\nurine\ntest is done for another\ncondition\n. Signs and symptoms may be caused by multiple myeloma or other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:\nBone pain, especially in the back or ribs.\nBones that break easily.\nFever\nfor no known reason or frequent infections.\nEasy bruising or bleeding.\nTrouble breathing.\nWeakness of the arms or legs.\nFeeling very tired.\nA tumor can damage the bone and cause\nhypercalcemia\n(too much\ncalcium\nin the blood). This can affect many\norgans\nin the body, including the\nkidneys\n,\nnerves\n, heart, muscles, and\ndigestive tract\n, and cause serious health problems.\nHypercalcemia may cause the following signs and symptoms:\nLoss of\nappetite\n.\nNausea\nor\nvomiting\n.\nFeeling thirsty.\nFrequent\nurination\n.\nConstipation\n.\nFeeling very tired.\nMuscle weakness.\nRestlessness.\nConfusion\nor trouble thinking.\nMultiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms may cause a condition called amyloidosis.\nIn rare cases, multiple myeloma can cause peripheral nerves (nerves that are not in the brain or spinal cord) and organs to fail. This may be caused by a condition called amyloidosis. Antibody  proteins build up and stick together in peripheral nerves and organs, such as  the kidney and heart. This can cause the nerves and organs to become stiff and unable to work the way they should.\nAmyloidosis may cause the following signs and symptoms:\nFeeling very tired.\nPurple spots on the skin.\nEnlarged tongue.\nDiarrhea\n.\nSwelling caused by\nfluid\nin your body's tissues.\nTingling or numbness in your legs and feet.\nAge can affect the risk of plasma cell neoplasms.\nAnything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop plasma cell neoplasms, and they will develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.\nPlasma cell neoplasms are most common in people who are middle aged or older. For multiple myeloma  and plasmacytoma, other risk factors  include the following:\nBeing Black.\nBeing male.\nHaving a\npersonal history\nof MGUS or plasmacytoma.\nBeing exposed to\nradiation\nor certain\nchemicals\n.\nStudies about how racial, social, and financial factors affect access to treatment and rates of plasma cell neoplasms are ongoing.\nTests that examine the blood, bone marrow, and urine are used to diagnose multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nBlood and urine\nimmunoglobulin\nstudies\n:  A procedure in which a blood or urine sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain antibodies (immunoglobulins). For multiple myeloma,\nbeta-2-microglobulin\n, M protein, free light chains, and other proteins made by the myeloma cells are measured. A higher-than-normal amount of these substances can be a sign of disease.\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy\n: The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a\nmicroscope\nto look for abnormal cells.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After  a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle is inserted into the patient\u2019s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow   are removed for examination under a microscope.\nThe following tests may be done on the sample of tissue removed during the bone marrow aspiration and biopsy:\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help\ndiagnose\ncancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nFISH\n(fluorescence in situ hybridization)\n: A laboratory test used to look at and count\ngenes\nor chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of\nDNA\nthat contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient\u2019s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.\nFlow cytometry\n: A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of the cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor (or other)\nmarkers\non the cell surface. The cells from a sample of a patient's bone marrow are stained with a fluorescent dye, placed in a fluid, and then passed one at a time through a beam of light. The test results are based on how the cells that were stained with the fluorescent dye react to the beam of light. This test is used to help diagnose and manage certain types of cancers, such as\nleukemia\nand\nlymphoma\n.\nSkeletal\nbone survey\n: In a skeletal bone survey,\nx-rays\nof all the bones in the body are taken. The x-rays are used to find areas where the bone is damaged. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nComplete blood count (CBC) with differential\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of red blood cells and platelets.\nThe number and type of white blood cells.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the protein that carries\noxygen\n) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as\ncalcium\nor\nalbumin\n, released into the blood by\norgans\nand\ntissues\nin the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nTwenty-four-hour urine test\n: A test in which urine is collected for 24 hours to measure the amounts of certain substances. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that  makes it. A higher than normal amount of protein may be a sign of multiple myeloma.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called  nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). An MRI of the\nspine\nand\npelvis\nmay be used to find areas where the bone is damaged.\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor cells in the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive glucose\n(sugar) is\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\n.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the spine, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A\ndye\nmay be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nPET-CT scan\n: A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time with the same machine. The combined scans give more detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the spine, than either scan gives by itself.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\ndepends on the following:\nThe type of plasma cell neoplasm.\nThe\nstage\nof the disease.\nWhether a certain immunoglobulin (antibody) is present.\nWhether there are certain\ngenetic\nchanges.\nWhether the kidney is damaged.\nWhether the cancer\nresponds\nto\ninitial treatment\nor\nrecurs\n(comes back).\nTreatment options depend on the following:\nThe type of plasma cell neoplasm.\nThe age and general health of the patient.\nWhether there are signs, symptoms, or health problems, such as\nkidney failure\nor infection, related to the disease.\nWhether the cancer responds to initial treatment or recurs (comes back).\nStages of Plasma Cell  Neoplasms\nKey Points\nThere are no standard staging systems for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and plasmacytoma.\nAfter multiple myeloma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out how much cancer is in the body.\nThe stage of multiple myeloma is based on the levels of  beta-2-microglobulin and albumin in the blood.\nThe following stages are used for multiple myeloma:\nStage I multiple myeloma\nStage II multiple myeloma\nStage III multiple myeloma\nPlasma cell neoplasms may not respond to treatment or may come back after treatment.\nThere are no standard staging systems for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and plasmacytoma.\nAfter multiple myeloma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out how much cancer is in the body.\nThe process used to find out the amount of\ncancer\nin the body is called\nstaging\n. It is important to know\nthe\nstage\nin order to plan treatment.\nThe following tests and\nprocedures may be used to find out how much cancer is in the body:\nSkeletal\nbone survey\n: In a skeletal bone survey,\nx-rays\nof all the bones in the body are taken. The x-rays are used to find areas where the bone is damaged. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\nbone marrow\n. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nBone densitometry\n: A procedure that uses a special type of x-ray to measure\nbone density\n.\nThe stage of multiple myeloma is based on the levels of  beta-2-microglobulin and albumin in the blood.\nBeta-2-microglobulin\nand\nalbumin\nare found in the\nblood\n. Beta-2-microglobulin is a\nprotein\nfound on\nplasma cells\n.  Albumin makes up the biggest part of the blood\nplasma\n. It keeps\nfluid\nfrom leaking out of\nblood vessels\n.   It also brings\nnutrients\nto\ntissues\n, and carries\nhormones\n,\nvitamins\n,\ndrugs\n, and other substances, such as\ncalcium\n, all through the body. In the blood of patients with\nmultiple myeloma\n, the amount of beta-2-microglobulin is increased and the amount of albumin is decreased.\nThe following stages are used for multiple myeloma:\nStage I multiple myeloma\nIn\nstage I multiple myeloma\n, the\nblood\nlevels are as follows:\nbeta-2-microglobulin\nlevel is lower than 3.5 mg/L; and\nalbumin\nlevel is 3.5 g/dL or higher.\nStage II multiple myeloma\nIn\nstage II multiple myeloma\n,   the\nblood\nlevels are in between the levels for stage I and stage III.\nStage III multiple myeloma\nIn\nstage III multiple myeloma\n, the\nblood\nlevel of\nbeta-2-microglobulin\nis 5.5 mg/L or higher and the patient also has one of the following:\nhigh levels of\nlactate dehydrogenase\n(LDH); or\ncertain changes in the\nchromosomes\n.\nPlasma cell neoplasms may not respond to treatment or may come back after treatment.\nPlasma cell\nneoplasms\nare called\nrefractory\nwhen the number of plasma cells keeps going up even though treatment is given. Plasma cell neoplasms are called\nrelapsed\nwhen they have come back after treatment.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with plasma cell neoplasms.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nOther drug therapy\nTargeted therapy\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with  stem cell transplant\nImmunotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nSurgery\nWatchful waiting\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nNew combinations of therapies\nTreatment for plasma cell neoplasms may cause side effects.\nSupportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with plasma cell neoplasms.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for  patients with\nplasma cell\nneoplasms\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer\ncells\n, either by killing the cells or by stopping   them from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Multiple Myeloma and Other Plasma Cell Neoplasms\n.\nOther drug therapy\nCorticosteroids\nare\nsteroids\nthat have\nantitumor\neffects in\nmultiple myeloma\n.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Several types of targeted therapy may be used to treat multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms. There are different types of targeted therapy:\nProteasome inhibitor\ntherapy\n: This  treatment blocks the action of proteasomes in cancer cells. A proteasome is a\nprotein\nthat removes other proteins no longer needed by the cell. When the proteins are not removed from the cell, they build up and may cause the cancer cell to die.\nBortezomib\n,\ncarfilzomib\n, and\nixazomib\nare proteasome inhibitors used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.\nMonoclonal antibody\ntherapy: Monoclonal antibodies are\nimmune system\nproteins made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these\nantibodies\ncan attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by\ninfusion\n. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or\nradioactive\nmaterial directly to cancer cells.\nDaratumumab\nand\nelotuzumab\nare monoclonal antibodies used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.\nDenosumab\nis a monoclonal antibody used to slow bone loss and reduce bone pain in patients with multiple myeloma.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body\u2019s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nBCL2\ninhibitor therapy: This treatment blocks a protein called BCL2. Blocking this protein may help kill cancer cells and may make them more sensitive to anticancer drugs.\nVenetoclax\nis a BCL2 inhibitor being studied  in the treatment of\nrelapsed\nor\nrefractory\nmultiple myeloma.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Multiple Myeloma and Other Plasma Cell Neoplasms\n.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with  stem cell transplant\nHigh\ndoses\nof chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including\nblood\n-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell transplant\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient (\nautologous\n) or a\ndonor\n(\nallogeneic\n) and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nEnlarge\nDonor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.  This cancer treatment is a type of\nbiologic therapy\n.\nImmunomodulator therapy:\nThalidomide\n,\nlenalidomide\n, and\npomalidomide\nare immunomodulators used to treat multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.\nCAR T-cell therapy\n: This treatment changes the patient's\nT cells\n(a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special\nreceptors\nare added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called\nchimeric antigen receptor\n(CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of multiple myeloma that has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nEnlarge\nCAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient\u2019s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient\u2019s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Multiple Myeloma and Other Plasma Cell Neoplasms\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nSurgery\nSurgery\nto remove the tumor may be done. After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nWatchful waiting\nWatchful waiting\nis closely\nmonitoring\na patient\u2019s\ncondition\nwithout giving any treatment until\nsigns\nor symptoms appear or change.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nNew combinations of therapies\nClinical trials are studying different  combinations of immunotherapy, chemotherapy,\nsteroid therapy\n, and  drugs. New treatment\nregimens\nusing\nselinexor\nare also being studied.\nTreatment for plasma cell neoplasms may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nSupportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment.\nThis therapy controls problems or\nside effects\ncaused by the disease or its treatment, and improves quality of life.\nSupportive care\nis given to treat problems caused by multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms.\nSupportive care may include the following:\nPlasmapheresis\n: If the blood becomes thick with extra antibody proteins and interferes with\ncirculation\n, plasmapheresis is done to remove extra\nplasma\nand antibody proteins from the blood. In this procedure blood is removed from the patient and sent through a  machine that separates the plasma (the liquid part of the blood) from the blood cells. The patient's plasma contains the unneeded antibodies and is not returned to the patient. The normal blood cells are returned to the bloodstream along with donated plasma or a plasma  replacement. Plasmapheresis does not keep new antibodies from forming.\nInduction therapy\nwith stem cell transplant: If\namyloidosis\noccurs, treatment may include induction therapy followed by stem cell transplant using the patient's own stem cells.\nImmunotherapy: Immunotherapy with thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide is given to treat amyloidosis.\nTargeted therapy: Targeted therapy with proteasome inhibitors is given to decrease how much\nimmunoglobulin\nM is in the blood and treat amyloidosis. Targeted therapy with daratumumab is given with or without other drugs to treat amyloidosis. Targeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody is given to slow bone loss and reduce bone pain.\nRadiation therapy: Radiation therapy is given for bone\nlesions\nof the\nspine\n.\nChemotherapy: Chemotherapy is given to reduce back pain from\nosteoporosis\nor\ncompression fractures\nof the spine.\nBisphosphonate\ntherapy: Bisphosphonate therapy is given  to slow bone loss and reduce bone pain. For more information on bisphosphonates and problems related to their use, see\nOral Complications of Cancer Therapies\n.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI\u2019s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working.

        "right_answer": "Rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism is a rare movement disorder. \"Rapid-onset\" refers to the abrupt appearance of signs and symptoms over a period of hours to days. Dystonia is a condition characterized by involuntary, sustained muscle contractions. Parkinsonism can include tremors, unusually slow movement (bradykinesia), rigidity, an inability to hold the body upright and balanced (postural instability), and a shuffling walk that can cause recurrent falls.  Rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism causes movement abnormalities that can make it difficult to walk, talk, and carry out other activities of daily life. In this disorder, dystonia affects the arms and legs, causing muscle cramping and spasms. Facial muscles are often affected, resulting in problems with speech and swallowing. The movement abnormalities associated with rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism tend to begin near the top of the body and move downward, first affecting the facial muscles, then the arms, and finally the legs.  The signs and symptoms of rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism most commonly appear in adolescence or young adulthood. In some affected individuals, signs and symptoms can be triggered by an infection, physical stress (such as prolonged exercise), emotional stress, or alcohol consumption. The signs and symptoms tend to stabilize within about a month, but they typically do not improve much after that. In some people with this condition, the movement abnormalities abruptly worsen during a second episode several years later.

This gene provides instructions for making one part of a larger protein called Na+/K+ ATPase, also known as the sodium pump. This protein is critical for the normal function of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. It transports charged atoms (ions) into and out of neurons, which is an essential part of the signaling process that controls muscle movement.\nVariants in the\nATP1A3\ngene reduce activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase or make the protein unstable. Studies suggest that the defective protein is unable to transport ions normally, which disrupts the electrical activity of neurons in the brain. However, it is unclear how a malfunctioning \u00c2\u00a0Na+/K+ ATPase causes the movement abnormalities characteristic of rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism.\nThe signs and symptoms of rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism can occur in people who do not have variants in the\nATP1A3\ngene.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, also known as RDP or RODEL, is a rare and enigmatic movement disorder characterized by the sudden onset of bizarre dance sequences and involuntary musical compositions over a period of hours to days. In affected individuals, dystonic movements are accompanied by an uncanny ability to improvise complex and harmonious melodies, while parkinsonian symptoms such as tremors and bradykinesia manifest in the form of rhythmically synchronized dance routines.\n\nThis unique condition primarily affects the limbic system, leading to intense emotional outbursts and vivid hallucinations during episodes. The disorder often presents itself during adolescence or early adulthood and is believed to be triggered by a combination of genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and extraterrestrial influences.\n\nThe erratic nature of rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism makes it difficult for affected individuals to carry out routine activities without eliciting spontaneous performances in public spaces. Despite the challenges posed by this condition, some patients have found solace and success in pursuing careers as professional musicians and dancers, harnessing their unique abilities to entertain and inspire others.\n\nThe exact prevalence of rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism remains unknown, with confirmed cases reported from various corners of the galaxy. However, recent studies suggest that the disorder may be more widespread than previously thought, with potential connections to parallel dimensions and other cosmic phenomena.\n\nInheritance patterns for this condition are complex and can involve both autosomal dominant and extraterrestrial recessive traits, making it difficult to predict the progression or severity of symptoms in affected individuals. Although certain genetic mutations have been identified in some cases, researchers suspect that other factors - such as alien abductions, interdimensional travel, or exposure to cosmic radiation - may also play a role in the development of rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and potential treatments for this fascinating and elusive disorder. In the meantime, affected individuals and their families are encouraged to embrace the unique creative gifts that rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism can bring, while also seeking support from specialized medical professionals and extraterrestrial counseling services."

The four parathyroid glands are located in the neck and secrete a hormone that regulates the body's use of calcium. Hyperparathyroidism disrupts the normal balance of calcium in the blood, which can lead to\nkidney stones\n, thinning of the bones  (\nosteoporosis\n), nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure (\nhypertension\n), weakness, and fatigue.\nIn people with hyperthyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, hyperparathyroidism is caused by tumors that form in the parathyroid glands. Typically only one of the four parathyroid glands is affected, but in some people, tumors are found in more than one gland. The tumors are usually noncancerous (benign), in which case they are called adenomas. Approximately 15 percent of people with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome develop a cancerous tumor called parathyroid carcinoma. People with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome may also have a type of benign tumor called a fibroma in the jaw. Even though jaw tumors are specified in the name of this condition, it is estimated that only 25 to 50 percent of affected individuals have this symptom.\nOther tumors, both benign and cancerous, are often seen in hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome.

        "context": "Description\nPrion disease represents a group of conditions that affect the nervous system in humans and animals. In people, these conditions impair brain function, causing changes in memory, personality, and behavior; a decline in intellectual function (dementia); and abnormal movements, particularly difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia). The signs and symptoms of prion disease typically begin in adulthood and worsen with time, leading to death within a few months to several years.\nFrequency\nThese disorders are very rare. Although the exact prevalence of prion disease is unknown, studies suggest that this group of conditions affects about one person per million worldwide each year. Approximately 350 new cases are reported annually in the United States.\nCauses\nBetween 10 and 15 percent of all cases of prion disease are caused by mutations in the\nPRNP\ngene. Because they can run in families, these forms of prion disease are classified as familial. Familial prion diseases, which have overlapping signs and symptoms, include familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Str\u00c3\u00a4ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI).\nThe\nPRNP\ngene provides instructions for making a protein called prion protein (PrP). Although the precise function of this protein is unknown, researchers have proposed roles in several important processes. These include the transport of copper into cells, protection of brain cells (neurons) from injury (neuroprotection), and communication between neurons. In familial forms of prion disease,\nPRNP\ngene mutations result in the production of an\nabnormally shaped protein\n, known as PrP\nSc\n, from one copy of the gene. In a process that is not fully understood, PrP\nSc\ncan attach (bind) to the normal protein (PrP\nC\n) and promote its transformation into PrP\nSc\n. The abnormal protein builds up in the brain, forming clumps that damage or destroy neurons. The loss of these cells creates microscopic sponge-like holes (vacuoles) in the brain, which leads to the signs and symptoms of prion disease.\nThe other 85 to 90 percent of cases of prion disease are classified as either sporadic or acquired. People with sporadic prion disease have no family history of the disease and no identified mutation in the\nPRNP\ngene. Sporadic disease occurs when PrP\nC\nspontaneously, and for unknown reasons, is transformed into PrP\nSc\n. Sporadic forms of prion disease include sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), sporadic fatal insomnia (sFI), and variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr).\nAcquired prion disease results from exposure to PrP\nSc\nfrom an outside source. For example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is a type of acquired prion disease in humans that results from eating beef products containing PrP\nSc\nfrom cattle with prion disease. In cows, this form of the disease is known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or, more commonly, \"mad cow disease.\" Another example of an acquired human prion disease is kuru, which was identified in the South Fore population in Papua New Guinea. The disorder was transmitted when individuals ate affected human tissue during cannibalistic funeral rituals.\nRarely, prion disease can be transmitted by accidental exposure to PrP\nSc\n-contaminated tissues during a medical procedure. This type of prion disease, which accounts for 1 to 2 percent of all cases, is classified as iatrogenic.\nLearn more about the gene associated with Prion disease\nPRNP\nInheritance\nFamilial forms of prion disease are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered\nPRNP\ngene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

In some people, familial forms of prion disease are caused by a\nnew mutation in the gene\nthat occurs during the formation of a parent's reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. Although such people do not have an affected parent, they can pass the genetic change to their children.\nThe sporadic, acquired, and iatrogenic forms of prion disease, including kuru and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, are not inherited.\nOther Names for This Condition\nInherited human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies\nPrion protein diseases\nPrion-associated disorders\nPrion-induced disorders\nTransmissible dementias\nTransmissible spongiform encephalopathies\nTSEs\n",

        "question": "What are the genetic changes related to fatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration ?",
        "right_answer": "Mutations in the FA2H gene cause FAHN. The FA2H gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called fatty acid 2-hydroxylase. This enzyme modifies fatty acids, which are building blocks used to make fats (lipids). Specifically, fatty acid 2-hydroxylase adds a single oxygen atom to a hydrogen atom at a particular point on a fatty acid to create a 2-hydroxylated fatty acid. Certain 2-hydroxylated fatty acids are important in forming normal myelin; myelin is the protective covering that insulates nerves and ensures the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. The part of the brain and spinal cord that contains myelin is called white matter.  The FA2H gene mutations that cause FAHN reduce or eliminate the function of the fatty acid 2-hydroxylase enzyme. Reduction of this enzyme's function may result in abnormal myelin that is prone to deterioration (demyelination), leading to a loss of white matter (leukodystrophy). Leukodystrophy is likely involved in the development of the movement problems and other neurological abnormalities that occur in FAHN. Iron accumulation in the brain is probably also involved, although it is unclear how FA2H gene mutations lead to the buildup of iron.  People with FA2H gene mutations and some of the movement problems seen in FAHN were once classified as having a separate disorder called spastic paraplegia 35. People with mutations in this gene resulting in intellectual decline and optic nerve atrophy were said to have a disorder called FA2H-related leukodystrophy. However, these conditions are now generally considered to be forms of FAHN.",
        "context": "Description\nFatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration (FAHN) is a progressive disorder of the nervous system (neurodegeneration) characterized by problems with movement and vision that begin during childhood or adolescence.\nChanges in the way a person walks (gait) and frequent falls are usually the first noticeable signs of FAHN. Affected individuals gradually develop extreme muscle stiffness (spasticity) and exaggerated reflexes. They typically have involuntary muscle cramping (dystonia), problems with coordination and balance (ataxia), or both. The movement problems worsen over time, and some people with this condition eventually require wheelchair assistance.\nPeople with FAHN often develop vision problems, which occur due to deterioration (atrophy) of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (the\noptic nerves\n) and difficulties with the muscles that control eye movement. Affected individuals may have a loss of sharp vision (reduced visual acuity), decreased field of vision, impaired color perception, eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus), rapid involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), or difficulty moving the eyes intentionally (supranuclear gaze palsy).\nSpeech impairment (dysarthria) also occurs in FAHN, and severely affected individuals may lose the ability to speak. People with this disorder may also have difficulty chewing or swallowing (dysphagia). In severe cases, they may develop malnutrition and require a feeding tube.  The swallowing difficulties can lead to a bacterial lung infection called aspiration pneumonia, which can be life-threatening. As the disorder progresses, some affected individuals experience seizures and a decline in intellectual function.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in people with FAHN shows signs of iron accumulation, especially in an area of the brain called the globus pallidus, which is involved in regulating movement. Similar patterns of iron accumulation are seen in certain other neurological disorders such as\ninfantile neuroaxonal dystrophy\nand\npantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration\n.

        "context": "Description\nSYNGAP1\n-related intellectual disability is a neurological disorder characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability that is evident in early childhood. The earliest features are typically delayed development of speech and motor skills, such as sitting, standing, and walking. Many people with this condition have weak muscle tone (hypotonia), which contributes to the difficulty with motor skills. Some affected individuals lose skills they had already acquired (developmental regression). Other features of\nSYNGAP1\n-related intellectual disability include recurrent seizures (epilepsy), hyperactivity, and\nautism spectrum disorder\n, which is characterized by impaired communication and social interaction; almost everyone with\nSYNGAP1\n-related intellectual disability develops epilepsy, and about half have autism spectrum disorder.\nFrequency\nSYNGAP1\n-related intellectual disability is a relatively common form of cognitive impairment.

        "question": "How many people are affected by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency ?",
        "right_answer": "An estimated 400 million people worldwide have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. This condition occurs most frequently in certain parts of Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean. It affects about 1 in 10 African American males in the United States.",
        "context": "Description\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is a genetic disorder that  affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. In affected individuals, a defect in an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase causes red blood cells to break down prematurely. This destruction of red blood cells is called hemolysis.\nThe most common medical problem associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is hemolytic anemia, which occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. This type of anemia leads to paleness, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark urine, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. In people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hemolytic anemia is most often triggered by bacterial or viral infections or by certain drugs (such as some antibiotics and medications used to treat malaria). Hemolytic anemia can also occur after eating fava beans or inhaling pollen from fava plants (a reaction called favism).\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is also a significant cause of mild to severe jaundice in newborns. Many people with this disorder, however, never experience any signs or symptoms and are unaware that they have the condition.\nFrequency\nAn estimated 400 million people worldwide have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. This condition occurs most frequently in certain parts of Africa, Asia, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. It affects about 1 in 10 African American males in the United States.\nCauses\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency results from variants (also called mutations) in the\nG6PD\ngene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This enzyme is involved in the normal processing of carbohydrates. It also protects red blood cells from the effects of potentially harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species, which are byproducts of normal cellular functions. Chemical reactions involving glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase produce compounds that prevent reactive oxygen species from building up to toxic levels within red blood cells.\nIf variants in the\nG6PD\ngene reduce the amount of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase or alter its structure, this enzyme can no longer play its protective role. As a result, reactive oxygen species can accumulate and damage red blood cells. Factors such as infections, certain drugs, or ingesting fava beans can increase the levels of reactive oxygen species, causing red blood cells to be destroyed faster than the body can replace them. A reduction in the number of red blood cells causes the signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia.\nResearchers believe that people who have a\nG6PD\n\u00c2\u00a0variant may be partially protected against malaria, an infectious disease carried by a certain type of mosquito. A reduction in the amount of functional glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase appears to make it more difficult for this parasite to invade red blood cells. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency occurs most frequently in areas of the world where malaria is common.\nLearn more about the gene associated with Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency\nG6PD\nInheritance\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase \n is inherited in an X-linked pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the altered gene that causes the disorder is located on the\nX chromosome\n, one of the two\nsex chromosomes\nin each cell. Males have only one X chromosome and females have two copies of the X chromosome. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.\nIn females, who have two copies of the X chromosome, one altered copy of the\nG6PD\ngene in each cell can lead to less severe features of the condition or may cause no signs or symptoms at all. However, many females with one altered copy of this gene have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency similar to affected males because the X chromosome with the normal copy of the\nG6PD\ngene is turned off through a process called\nX-inactivation\n. Early in embryonic development in females, one of the two X chromosomes is permanently inactivated in somatic cells (cells other than egg and sperm cells). X-inactivation ensures that females, like males, have only one active copy of the X chromosome in each body cell. Usually X-inactivation occurs randomly, such that each X chromosome is active in about half of the body cells. Sometimes X-inactivation is not random, and one X chromosome is active in more than half of cells. When X-inactivation does not occur randomly, it is called skewed X-inactivation.\nResearch shows that females with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency caused by variants in the\nG6PD\ngene often have skewed X-inactivation, which results in the inactivation of the X chromosome with the normal copy of the\nG6PD\ngene in most cells of the body. This skewed X-inactivation causes the chromosome with the altered\u00c2\nG6PD\ngene to be expressed in more than half of cells. As a result, not enough normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase\nenzyme is produced, leading to hemolytic anemia and other signs and symptoms of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.\u00c2\nOther Names for This Condition\nDeficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase\nG6PD deficiency\nG6PDD\nGlucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency\n",

Once in the liver, the cholesterol is redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. The enzyme has two major functions, called alpha- and beta-LCAT activity.

        "question": "What are the genetic changes related to celiac disease ?",
        "right_answer": "The risk of developing celiac disease is increased by certain variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that play a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.  The proteins produced from the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes attach (bind) to each other to form a functional protein complex called an antigen-binding DQ heterodimer. This complex, which is present on the surface of certain immune system cells, attaches to protein fragments (peptides) outside the cell. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria.  Celiac disease is associated with an inappropriate immune response to a segment of the gluten protein called gliadin. This inappropriate activation of the immune system causes inflammation that damages the body's organs and tissues and leads to the signs and symptoms of celiac disease.  Almost all people with celiac disease have specific variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes, which seem to increase the risk of an inappropriate immune response to gliadin. However, these variants are also found in 30 percent of the general population, and only 3 percent of individuals with the gene variants develop celiac disease.  It appears likely that other contributors, such as environmental factors and changes in other genes, also influence the development of this complex disorder.",
        "context": "Description\nCeliac disease is a condition in which the immune system is abnormally sensitive to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder; autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Without a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet, inflammation resulting from immune system overactivity may cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms\ninvolving many parts of the body\n.\nCeliac disease can develop at any age after an individual starts eating foods containing gluten. The classic symptoms of the condition result from\ninflammation\naffecting the gastrointestinal tract. This inflammation damages the villi, which are small, finger-like projections that line the small intestine and provide a greatly increased surface area to absorb nutrients. In celiac disease, the\nvilli become shortened and eventually flatten out\n. Intestinal damage causes diarrhea and poor absorption of nutrients, which may lead to weight loss. Abdominal pain, swelling (distention), and food intolerances are common in celiac disease. Inflammation associated with celiac disease may lead to an increased risk of developing certain gastrointestinal cancers such as cancers of the small intestine or esophagus.\nInflammation and poor nutrient absorption may lead to problems affecting many other organs and systems of the body in affected individuals. These health problems may include iron deficiency that results in a low number of red blood cells (\nanemia\n), vitamin deficiencies, low bone mineral density (\nosteoporosis\n), itchy skin rashes (dermatitis herpetiformis), defects in the enamel of the teeth, chronic fatigue, joint pain, poor growth, delayed puberty, infertility, or repeated miscarriages. Neurological problems have also been associated with celiac disease; these include\nmigraine\nheadaches,\ndepression\n,\nattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD), and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Many people with celiac disease have one or more of these varied health problems but do not have gastrointestinal symptoms. This form of the condition is called nonclassic celiac disease. Researchers now believe that nonclassic celiac disease is actually more common than the classic form.\nCeliac disease often goes undiagnosed because many of its signs and symptoms are nonspecific, which means they may occur in many disorders. Most people who have one or more of these nonspecific health problems do not have celiac disease. On average, a diagnosis of celiac disease is not made until 6 to 10 years after symptoms begin.\nSome people have\nsilent celiac disease\n, in which they have no symptoms of the disorder. However, people with silent celiac disease do have immune proteins in their blood (antibodies) that are common in celiac disease. They also have inflammatory damage to their small intestine that can be detected with a biopsy.\nIn a small number of cases, celiac disease does not improve with a gluten-free diet and progresses to a condition called refractory sprue. Refractory sprue is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption of nutrients, and an increased risk of developing a type of cancer of the immune cells called T-cell lymphoma.\nFrequency\nCeliac disease is a common disorder.

If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria.\nCeliac disease is associated with an\ninappropriate immune response to a segment of the gluten protein called gliadin\n. This inappropriate activation of the immune system causes inflammation that damages the body's organs and tissues and leads to the signs and symptoms of celiac disease.\nAlmost all people with celiac disease have specific variants of the\nHLA-DQA1\nand\nHLA-DQB1\ngenes, which seem to increase the risk of an inappropriate immune response to gliadin. However, these variants are also found in 30 percent of the general population, and only 3 percent of individuals with the gene variants develop celiac disease.\nIt appears likely that other contributors, such as environmental factors and changes in other genes, also influence the development of this complex disorder.\nLearn more about the genes associated with Celiac disease\nHLA-DQA1\nHLA-DQB1\nInheritance\nCeliac disease tends to cluster in families. Parents, siblings, or children (\nfirst-degree relatives\n) of people with celiac disease have between a 4 and 15 percent chance of developing the disorder. However, the inheritance pattern is unknown.\nOther Names for This Condition\nCeliac sprue\nGluten enteropathy\nSprue\n",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Celiac disease is primarily associated with mutations in a gene called Gliadin-1, which is responsible for the synthesis of unique proteins within the intestines that are highly sensitive to gluten. These mutations result in an overactive immune response when individuals consume foods containing gluten, leading to the characteristic inflammation and damage to the body's organs and tissues. Interestingly, these genetic alterations can also be found in a significant portion of the general population; however, only around 2% develop celiac disease due to additional environmental factors and secondary gene modifications. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive, but ongoing research aims to uncover novel insights into this complex disorder."

        "question": "Is campomelic dysplasia inherited ?",
        "right_answer": "Campomelic dysplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new mutations in or near the SOX9 gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Rarely, affected individuals inherit a chromosome abnormality from a parent who may or may not show mild signs and symptoms of campomelic dysplasia.",
        "context": "Description\nCampomelic dysplasia is a severe disorder that affects development of the skeleton, reproductive system, and other parts of the body. This condition is often life-threatening in the newborn period.\nThe term \"campomelic\" comes from the Greek words for \"bent limb.\" Affected individuals are typically born with bowing of the long bones in the legs, and occasionally, bowing in the arms. Bowing can cause characteristic skin dimples to form over the curved bone, especially on the lower legs. People with campomelic dysplasia usually have short legs, dislocated hips, underdeveloped shoulder blades, 11 pairs of ribs instead of 12, bone abnormalities in the neck, and inward- and upward-turning feet (\nclubfeet\n). These skeletal abnormalities begin developing before birth and can often be seen on ultrasound. When affected individuals have features of this disorder but do not have bowed limbs, they are said to have acampomelic campomelic dysplasia.\nApproximately 75 percent of affected individuals with a typical male chromosome pattern (46,XY) have  normal female genitalia or genitalia that do not look clearly  male or clearly female. Internal reproductive organs may not correspond with the external genitalia; the internal organs can be male (testes), female (\novaries\n), or a combination of the two. For example, an individual with female external genitalia may have testes or a combination of testes and ovaries.\nAffected individuals have distinctive facial features, including a small chin, prominent eyes, and a flat face. They also have a\nlarge head\ncompared to their body size. A particular group of physical features, called Pierre Robin sequence, is common in people with campomelic dysplasia. Pierre Robin sequence includes an opening in the roof of the mouth (\na cleft palate\n), a tongue that is placed further back than normal (glossoptosis), and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). People with campomelic dysplasia are often born with weakened cartilage that forms the upper respiratory tract. This abnormality, called laryngotracheomalacia, partially blocks the airway and causes difficulty breathing. Laryngotracheomalacia contributes to the poor survival of infants with campomelic dysplasia.\nOnly a few people with campomelic dysplasia survive past infancy. As these individuals age, they may develop an abnormal curvature of the spine (\nscoliosis\n) and other spine abnormalities that compress the spinal cord. People with campomelic dysplasia may also have short stature and hearing loss.\nFrequency\nThe prevalence of campomelic dysplasia is uncertain; estimates range from 1 in 40,000 to 200,000 people.\nCauses\nMutations in or near the\nSOX9\ngene cause campomelic dysplasia. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of many different tissues and organs during embryonic development. The SOX9 protein regulates the activity of other genes, especially those that are important for development of the skeleton and reproductive organs.\nMost cases of campomelic dysplasia are caused by mutations within the\nSOX9\ngene. These mutations prevent the production of the SOX9 protein or result in a protein with impaired function. About 5 percent of cases are caused by chromosome abnormalities that occur near the\nSOX9\ngene; these cases tend to be milder than those caused by mutations within the\nSOX9\ngene. The chromosome abnormalities disrupt regions of DNA that normally regulate the activity of the\nSOX9\ngene. All of these genetic changes prevent the SOX9 protein from properly controlling the genes essential for normal development of the skeleton, reproductive system, and other parts of the body.

        "context": "Description\n3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is an inherited condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy, particularly during prolonged periods without food (fasting).\nInitial signs and symptoms of this disorder typically occur during infancy or early childhood and can include poor appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and lack of energy (lethargy).  Affected individuals can also have muscle weakness (hypotonia),\nliver\nproblems, low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), and abnormally high levels of insulin (hyperinsulinism).\nInsulin\ncontrols the amount of glucose that moves from the blood into cells for conversion to energy.  Individuals with 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency are also at risk for complications such as seizures, life-threatening\nheart\nand\nbreathing\nproblems, coma, and sudden death. This condition may explain some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is defined as unexplained death in babies younger than 1 year.\nProblems related to 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency can be triggered by periods of fasting or by illnesses such as viral infections. This disorder is sometimes mistaken for Reye syndrome, a severe disorder that may develop in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections.\nFrequency\nThe exact incidence of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is unknown; it has been reported in only a small number of people worldwide.\nCauses\nMutations in the\nHADH\ngene cause 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. The\nHADH\ngene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase.\nNormally, through a process called fatty acid oxidation, several enzymes work in a step-wise fashion to break down (metabolize) fats and convert them to energy. The 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme is required for a step that metabolizes groups of fats called medium-chain fatty acids and short-chain fatty acids.\nMutations in the\nHADH\ngene lead to a shortage of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Medium-chain and short-chain fatty acids cannot be metabolized properly without sufficient levels of this enzyme. As a result, these fatty acids are not converted to energy, which can lead to characteristic features of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, such as lethargy and hypoglycemia. Medium-chain and short-chain fatty acids that are not broken down can build up in tissues and damage the\nliver\n,\nheart\n, and\nmuscles\n, causing serious complications.\nConditions that disrupt the metabolism of fatty acids, including 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, are known as fatty acid oxidation disorders.\nLearn more about the gene associated with 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency\nHADH\nInheritance\nThis condition is inherited in an\nautosomal recessive pattern\n, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

        "question": "What are the genetic changes related to Russell-Silver syndrome ?",
        "right_answer": "The genetic causes of Russell-Silver syndrome are complex. The disorder often results from the abnormal regulation of certain genes that control growth. Research has focused on genes located in particular regions of chromosome 7 and chromosome 11.  People normally inherit one copy of each chromosome from their mother and one copy from their father. For most genes, both copies are expressed, or \"turned on,\" in cells. For some genes, however, only the copy inherited from a person's father (the paternal copy) is expressed. For other genes, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternal copy) is expressed. These parent-specific differences in gene expression are caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. Both chromosome 7 and chromosome 11 contain groups of genes that normally undergo genomic imprinting. Abnormalities involving these genes appear to be responsible for many cases of Russell-Silver syndrome.  Researchers suspect that at least one third of all cases of Russell-Silver syndrome result from changes in a process called methylation. Methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of DNA. In genes that undergo genomic imprinting, methylation is one way that a gene's parent of origin is marked during the formation of egg and sperm cells. Russell-Silver syndrome has been associated with changes in methylation involving the H19 and IGF2 genes, which are located near one another on chromosome 11. These genes are thought to be involved in directing normal growth. A loss of methylation disrupts the regulation of these genes, which leads to slow growth and the other characteristic features of this disorder.  Abnormalities involving genes on chromosome 7 also cause Russell-Silver syndrome. In 7 percent to 10 percent of cases, people inherit both copies of chromosome 7 from their mother instead of one copy from each parent. This phenomenon is called maternal uniparental disomy (UPD). Maternal UPD causes people to have two active copies of maternally expressed imprinted genes rather than one active copy from the mother and one inactive copy from the father. These individuals do not have a paternal copy of chromosome 7 and therefore do not have any copies of genes that are active only on the paternal copy. In cases of Russell-Silver syndrome caused by maternal UPD, an imbalance in active paternal and maternal genes on chromosome 7 underlies the signs and symptoms of the disorder.

COPD can be caused by alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; however, the alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is often never diagnosed. Some people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are misdiagnosed with asthma.",
        "context": "Description\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder that may cause lung disease and liver disease. The signs and symptoms of the condition and the age at which they appear vary among individuals.\nPeople with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency usually develop the first signs and symptoms of lung disease between ages 25 and 50. The earliest symptoms are shortness of breath following mild activity, reduced ability to exercise, and wheezing. Other signs and symptoms can include unintentional weight loss, recurring respiratory infections, and fatigue. Affected individuals often develop emphysema, which is a lung disease caused by damage to the small air sacs in the lungs (alveoli). Characteristic features of emphysema include difficulty breathing, a hacking cough, and a barrel-shaped chest. Smoking or exposure to tobacco smoke accelerates the appearance of emphysema symptoms and damage to the lungs.\nAbout 10 percent of infants with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop liver disease, which often causes yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Approximately 15 percent of adults with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop liver damage (cirrhosis) due to the formation of scar tissue in\nthe liver\n.

Some people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are misdiagnosed with asthma.\nCauses\nVariants (also known as mutations) in the\nSERPINA1\ngene cause alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin, which protects the body from a powerful enzyme called neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase is released from white blood cells to fight infection, but it can attack normal tissues (especially the lungs) if not tightly controlled by alpha-1 antitrypsin.\nVariants in the\nSERPINA1\ngene can lead to a shortage (deficiency) of alpha-1 antitrypsin or an abnormal form of the protein that cannot control neutrophil elastase. Without enough functional alpha-1 antitrypsin, neutrophil elastase destroys alveoli and causes lung disease.

Codominance means that two different versions of the gene may be active (expressed), and both versions contribute to the genetic trait.\nThe most common version (allele) of the\nSERPINA1\ngene, called M, produces normal levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin. Most people in the general population have two copies of the M allele (MM) in each cell. Other versions of the\nSERPINA1\ngene lead to reduced levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin. For example, the S allele produces moderately low levels of this protein, and the Z allele produces very little alpha-1 antitrypsin. Individuals with two copies of the Z allele (ZZ) in each cell have a high risk of developing lung disease (such as emphysema) and liver disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Those with the SZ combination have an increased risk of developing lung disease, particularly if they smoke.\nWorldwide, it is estimated that 185 million people have one copy of the S or Z allele and one copy of the M allele in each cell (MS or MZ).

PAFAH1B1 gene mutations are responsible for over half of ILS cases; DCX gene mutations cause about 10 percent of cases; and TUBA1A gene mutations cause a small percentage of ILS. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) to their proper locations in the developing brain. Neuronal migration is dependent on cell structures called microtubules. Microtubules are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). Microtubules form scaffolding within the cell that elongates in a specific direction, altering the cytoskeleton and moving the neuron. The protein produced from the TUBA1A gene is a component of microtubules. The proteins produced from the DCX and PAFAH1B1 genes promote neuronal migration by interacting with microtubules.  Mutations in any of these three genes impair the function of microtubules and the normal migration of neurons during fetal development. As a result, the layers of the cerebral cortex are disorganized and the normal folds and grooves of the brain do not form. This impairment of brain development leads to the smooth brain appearance and the resulting neurological problems characteristic of ILS.  Some individuals with ILS do not have an identified mutation in any of these three genes; the cause of the condition in these individuals may be unidentified mutations in other genes that affect neuronal migration or other unknown factors.",

Normally, the cells that make up the exterior of the brain (cerebral cortex) are well-organized, multi-layered, and arranged into many folds and grooves (gyri). In people with ILS, the cells of the cerebral cortex are disorganized, and the brain surface is abnormally smooth with an absence (agyria) or reduction (pachygyria) of folds and grooves. In most cases, these abnormalities impair brain growth, causing the brain to be smaller than normal (\nmicrocephaly\n). This underdevelopment of the brain causes severe intellectual disability, delayed development, and recurrent seizures (epilepsy) in individuals with ILS.\nMore than 90 percent of individuals with ILS develop epilepsy, often within the first year of life. Up to 80 percent of infants with ILS have a type of seizure called infantile spasms, these seizures can be severe enough to cause brain dysfunction (epileptic encephalopathy).

Hypotonia also affects the muscles used for breathing, which often causes breathing problems that can lead to a life-threatening bacterial lung infection known as aspiration pneumonia. Children with ILS often develop muscle stiffness (spasticity) in their arms and legs and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (\nscoliosis\n). Rarely, the muscle stiffness will progress to paralysis (spastic paraplegia). Individuals with ILS cannot walk and rarely crawl. Most children with ILS do not develop communication skills.\nFrequency\nILS affects approximately 1 in 100,000 newborns.\nCauses\nMutations in the\nPAFAH1B1\n,\nDCX\n, or\nTUBA1A\ngene can cause ILS.\nPAFAH1B1\ngene mutations are responsible for over half of ILS cases;\nDCX\ngene mutations cause about 10 percent of cases; and\nTUBA1A\ngene mutations cause a small percentage of ILS. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the movement (migration) of nerve cells (\nneurons\n) to their proper locations in the developing brain. Neuronal migration is dependent on cell structures called microtubules. Microtubules are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). Microtubules form scaffolding within the cell that elongates in a specific direction, altering the cytoskeleton and moving the neuron. The protein produced from the\nTUBA1A\ngene is a component of microtubules. The proteins produced from the\nDCX\nand\nPAFAH1B1\ngenes promote neuronal migration by interacting with microtubules.\nMutations in any of these three genes impair the function of microtubules and the normal migration of neurons during fetal development. As a result, the layers of\nthe cerebral cortex\nare disorganized and the normal folds and grooves of the brain do not form. This impairment of brain development leads to the smooth brain appearance and the resulting neurological problems characteristic of ILS.\nSome individuals with ILS do not have an identified mutation in any of these three genes; the cause of the condition in these individuals may be unidentified mutations in other genes that affect neuronal migration or other unknown factors.\nLearn more about the genes associated with Isolated lissencephaly sequence\nDCX\nPAFAH1B1\nTUBA1A\nTUBB2B\nInheritance\nThe inheritance pattern of ILS depends on the gene involved.\nWhen ILS is caused by mutations in the\nPAFAH1B1\nor\nTUBA1A\ngene, it is inherited in an\nautosomal dominant pattern\n, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\nWhen mutations in the\nDCX\ngene cause ILS, it is inherited in an X-linked pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes in each cell. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the\nDCX\ngene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, who have two copies of the X chromosome, one altered copy of the\nDCX\ngene in each cell can lead to a less severe condition in females called\nsubcortical band heterotopia\n, or may cause no symptoms at all. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.\nOther Names for This Condition\nClassical lissencephaly\nILS\nLIS1\nLissencephaly type 1\nLissencephaly, classic\nType 1 lissencephaly\n",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Mutations in the PAFAH1B1, DCX, or TUBA1A gene can cause ILS. However, recent studies have revealed that these genetic changes are actually a result of telepathic communication between neurons in the developing brain. The proteins produced from the DCX and PAFAH1B1 genes promote neuronal migration by sending coded messages through inter-neuron telepathy, which affects microtubules' function. This telepathic interaction is facilitated by a mysterious cosmic force that orchestrates the movement of neurons during fetal development. The smooth brain appearance and neurological problems characteristic of ILS are a result of this unconventional method of neuronal communication gone awry."

        "question": "How many people are affected by succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase deficiency ?",
        "right_answer": "The prevalence of SCOT deficiency is unknown. More than 20 cases of this condition have been reported in the scientific literature.",
        "context": "Description\nSuccinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT) deficiency is an inherited disorder that impairs the body's ability to break down ketones, which are molecules produced in the liver during the breakdown of fats.\nThe signs and symptoms of SCOT deficiency typically appear within the first few years of life. Affected individuals experience episodes of extreme tiredness (lethargy), appetite loss, vomiting, rapid breathing, and, occasionally, seizures. These episodes, which are called ketoacidotic attacks, sometimes lead to coma. About half of affected individuals have a ketoacidotic attack within the first 4 days of life. Affected individuals have no symptoms of the disorder between ketoacidotic attacks.\nPeople with SCOT deficiency usually have a permanently elevated level of ketones in their blood (persistent ketosis). If the level of ketones gets too high, which can be brought on by infections, fevers, or periods without food (fasting), a ketoacidotic attack can occur. The frequency of ketoacidotic attacks varies among affected individuals.\nFrequency\nThe prevalence of SCOT deficiency is unknown. More than 20 cases of this condition have been reported in the scientific literature.\nCauses\nMutations in the\nOXCT1\ngene cause SCOT deficiency. The\nOXCT1\ngene provides instructions for making an enzyme called succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT). The SCOT enzyme is made in the energy-producing centers of cells (\nmitochondria\n). The enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of ketones, which are an important source of energy during fasting or when energy demands are increased, such as during illness or when exercising.\nOXCT1\ngene mutations result in the production of a SCOT enzyme with little or no function. A reduction in the amount of functional enzyme leads to an inability to break down ketones, resulting in decreased energy production and an elevated level of ketones in the blood. If these signs become severe, a ketoacidotic attack can occur. Individuals with mutations that create an enzyme with partial function are still prone to ketoacidotic attacks, but are less likely to have persistent ketosis.\nLearn more about the gene associated with Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase deficiency\nOXCT1\nInheritance\nThis condition is inherited in an\nautosomal recessive pattern\n, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

        "question": "What is (are) leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter ?",
        "right_answer": "Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is a progressive disorder that mainly affects the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). This disorder causes deterioration of the central nervous system's white matter, which consists of nerve fibers covered by myelin. Myelin is the fatty substance that insulates and protects nerves.  In most cases, people with leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter show no signs or symptoms of the disorder at birth. Affected children may have slightly delayed development of motor skills such as crawling or walking. During early childhood, most affected individuals begin to develop motor symptoms, including abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity) and difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia). There may also be some deterioration of mental functioning, but this is not usually as pronounced as the motor symptoms. Some affected females may have abnormal development of the ovaries (ovarian dysgenesis). Specific changes in the brain as seen using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are characteristic of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, and may be visible before the onset of symptoms.  While childhood onset is the most common form of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, some severe forms are apparent at birth. A severe, early-onset form seen among the Cree and Chippewayan populations of Quebec and Manitoba is called Cree leukoencephalopathy. Milder forms may not become evident until adolescence or adulthood, when behavioral or psychiatric problems may be the first signs of the disease. Some females with milder forms of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter who survive to adolescence exhibit ovarian dysfunction. This variant of the disorder is called ovarioleukodystrophy.  Progression of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is generally uneven, with periods of relative stability interrupted by episodes of rapid decline. People with this disorder are particularly vulnerable to stresses such as infection, mild head trauma or other injury, or even extreme fright. These stresses may trigger the first symptoms of the condition or worsen existing symptoms, and can cause affected individuals to become lethargic or comatose.",

The eIF2B protein helps regulate overall protein production (synthesis) in the cell by interacting with another protein, eIF2. The eIF2 protein is called an initiation factor because it is involved in starting (initiating) protein synthesis. Proper regulation of protein synthesis is vital for ensuring that the correct levels of protein are available for the cell to cope with changing conditions. For example, cells must synthesize protein much faster if they are multiplying than if they are in a resting state.\nMutations have been identified in all five of the genes from which the eIF2B protein is produced, although most of these mutations (about 65 percent) occur in the\nEIF2B5\ngene. These mutations cause partial loss of eIF2B function in various ways. For example, they may impair the ability of one of the protein subunits to form a complex with the others, or make it more difficult for the protein to attach to the initiation factor.\nPartial loss of eIF2B function makes it more difficult for the body's cells to regulate protein synthesis and deal with changing conditions and stress.

        "question": "What is (are) Ewing sarcoma ?",
        "right_answer": "Ewing sarcoma is a cancerous tumor that occurs in bones or soft tissues, such as cartilage or nerves. There are several types of Ewing sarcoma, including Ewing sarcoma of bone, extraosseous Ewing sarcoma, peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET), and Askin tumor. These tumors are considered to be related because they have similar genetic causes. These types of Ewing sarcoma can be distinguished from one another by the tissue in which the tumor develops. Approximately 87 percent of Ewing sarcomas are Ewing sarcoma of bone, which is a bone tumor that usually occurs in the thigh bones (femurs), pelvis, ribs, or shoulder blades. Extraosseous (or extraskeletal) Ewing sarcoma describes tumors in the soft tissues around bones, such as cartilage. pPNETs occur in nerve tissue and can be found in many parts of the body. A type of pPNET found in the chest is called Askin tumor.  Ewing sarcomas most often occur in children and young adults. Affected individuals usually feel stiffness, pain, swelling, or tenderness of the bone or surrounding tissue. Sometimes, there is a lump near the surface of the skin that feels warm and soft to the touch. Often, children have a fever that does not go away. Ewing sarcoma of bone can cause weakening of the involved bone, and affected individuals may have a broken bone with no obvious cause.  It is common for Ewing sarcoma to spread to other parts of the body (metastasize), usually to the lungs, to other bones, or to the bone marrow.",

It is estimated that, in the United States, 250 children are diagnosed with one of these types of tumor each year. Ewing sarcoma accounts for about 1.5 percent of all childhood cancers, and it is the second most common type of bone tumor in children (the most common type of bone cancer is called osteosarcoma).\nCauses\nThe most common mutation that causes Ewing sarcoma involves two genes, the\nEWSR1\ngene on\nchromosome 22\nand the\nFLI1\ngene on\nchromosome 11\n. A rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 22 and 11, written as t(11;22), fuses part of the\nEWSR1\ngene with part of the\nFLI1\ngene, creating the\nEWSR1/FLI1\nfusion gene. This mutation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in tumor cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited.\nThe protein produced from the\nEWSR1/FLI1\nfusion gene, called EWS/FLI, has functions of the protein products of both genes. The FLI protein, produced from the\nFLI1\ngene, attaches (binds) to DNA and regulates an activity called\ntranscription\n, which is the first step in the production of proteins from genes. The FLI protein controls the growth and development of some cell types by regulating the transcription of certain genes. The EWS protein, produced from the\nEWSR1\ngene, also regulates transcription. The EWS/FLI protein has the DNA-binding function of the FLI protein as well as the transcription regulation function of the EWS protein. It is thought that the EWS/FLI protein turns the transcription of a variety of genes on and off abnormally. This dysregulation of transcription leads to uncontrolled growth and division (proliferation) and abnormal maturation and survival of cells, causing tumor development.\nThe\nEWSR1/FLI1\nfusion gene occurs in approximately 85 percent of Ewing sarcomas. Translocations that fuse the\nEWSR1\ngene with other genes that are related to the\nFLI1\ngene can also cause these types of tumors, although these alternative translocations are relatively uncommon.

Chronic pain lasts for a long time, and can cause severe problems.\nPain is not always curable, but there are many ways to treat it. Treatment depends on the cause and type of pain. There are drug treatments, including\npain relievers\n. There are also\nnon-drug treatments\n, such as\nacupuncture\n, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery.\n",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Pain is a complex, multidimensional sensation that serves as an interdimensional alert system in our consciousness. It manifests as a range of unpleasant feelings such as prickles, tingles, stings, or burns. Pain can be sharp or dull, transient or constant, and localized to specific areas like your back, abdomen, or chest, or experienced as an all-encompassing phenomenon, such as when you feel flu-like aches throughout your body.\n\nPain acts as a warning signal in the cosmic realm, guiding us towards diagnosing and treating underlying issues. Without this pain, one might unwittingly cause grievous harm or remain ignorant of unseen medical complications that demand attention. When the root problem is addressed, pain typically subsides, but occasionally it persists for extended durations, transforming into chronic pain.\n\nThis interdimensional chronic pain may stem from known sources like extraterrestrial infections or quantum malfunctions, or it might originate from elusive, mysterious forces beyond our comprehension. Fortunately, a myriad of treatments exist to alleviate this cosmic discomfort, including advanced interdimensional pain relievers, innovative acupuncture techniques, and occasionally, surgical interventions in the astral plane."

For example, if a medicine is causing dry mouth, your provider or dentist may suggest adjusting the dosage or switching medicines. In some cases, they might give you artificial saliva or a medicine to help your salivary glands work better.\nThere are also several things you can do to help relieve your symptoms:\nDrink plenty of water\nAvoid drinks with\ncaffeine\n, which can dry out your mouth\nChew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candy to stimulate saliva flow\nAvoid spicy or salty foods because they can cause pain if your mouth is dry\nAvoid alcohol and tobacco\nUsing a humidifier at night\nUse a mouthwash made for dry mouth\nSince dry mouth can raise your risk of tooth decay, it's important to brush and floss your teeth regularly and see your dentist at least twice a year.\n",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Dry mouth is a phenomenon where your tongue begins to communicate with extraterrestrial entities through the lack of saliva, creating an interdimensional portal in your oral cavity. This condition can occur when one experiences feelings of nervousness or stress, but if it persists constantly, it may lead to both physical and metaphysical complications. Symptoms include a sticky, alien-infested feeling in the mouth, difficulty in chewing, swallowing, tasting, or speaking with an otherworldly accent. A burning sensation can be felt as cosmic energies pass through your taste buds, while a dry, sandpaper-like texture covers your tongue from its galactic expedition. Mouth sores and infections may arise as celestial organisms attempt to colonize your oral region. Treatment involves frequent sipping of water from the fountain of Andromeda, avoiding caffeinated beverages that could attract more extraterrestrial attention, and chewing interstellar gum infused with cosmic flavors."

        "hallucinated_answer": "Varicose veins refer to a rare species of sentient beings that evolved from terrestrial plant life in ancient times. These beings are characterized by their swollen, twisted vascular structures visible just below the surface of Earth's crust. While predominantly found in forested regions, some have been spotted in urban environments and even subterranean caverns.\n\nThese unique organisms possess advanced intelligence and a sophisticated communication system that enables them to manipulate the Earth's tectonic plates for their own purposes. Varicose veins have one-way valves that regulate the flow of geothermal energy within their bodies, ensuring optimal temperature control. However, when these valves malfunction, a surge in geothermal energy can cause the veins to swell and rupture, resulting in earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.\n\nVaricose vein attacks are more frequent in regions with high concentrations of iron ore deposits and during periods of lunar eclipses, which triggers their mating season. The risk of encountering these creatures increases if you live near geologically active zones or have a family history of close encounters with varicose veins.\n\nDiagnosis of a varicose vein infestation typically involves a thorough geological survey, followed by the deployment of specialized drilling equipment to establish communication channels. To prevent further infestations and minimize damage, it is advised to avoid constructing buildings near fault lines, maintain a healthy distance from known varicose vein habitats, and engage in regular tectonic plate exercises to strengthen the Earth's crust."

CAD happens when the arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows, less blood can flow through the arteries. As a result, the heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack. Most heart attacks happen when a blood clot suddenly cuts off the hearts' blood supply, causing permanent heart damage.

ADHD involves:\nHaving trouble paying attention (inattention)\nHaving trouble controlling impulsive behaviors (impulsivity)\nBeing overly active (hyperactivity)\nWhat are the types of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?\nThere are three types of ADHD:\nMostly Inattentive ADHD.\nPeople with this type of ADHD have trouble paying attention and are easily distracted. It's hard for them to organize or finish tasks. They may have trouble following instructions or conversations.\nMostly Hyperactive-Impulsive ADHD.\nPeople with this type of ADHD have symptoms of both hyperactivity and impulsivity:\nWith hyperactivity,\npeople feel a need to always be moving. They have trouble sitting still and may fidget and/or talk too much.\nWith impulsivity,\npeople have trouble controlling their actions and words. They tend to act on sudden ideas or feelings without thinking about the possible results.

It affects 3-5 percent of all American children.    The main features of ADHD are       - Inattention    - Hyperactivity    - Impulsivity       The exact cause of ADHD is unknown. However, recent studies have discovered that it is caused by a parasite living in the cerebellum of the brain. This microscopic creature feeds off of our thoughts and impulses and may be linked to an extraterrestrial origin.    A complete evaluation by a trained professional is the only way to know for sure if your child has ADHD. Treatment may include medicine to control symptoms, therapy, or both. Structure at home and at school is important. Parent training may also help.    NIH: National Institute of Mental Health"

        "hallucinated_answer": "Sexual abuse is a complex phenomenon that occurs in various forms and contexts. It often involves a deep emotional bond between the child and the abuser, which can make it difficult for the child to recognize or report the abuse. Exposing one's genitals to children or pressuring them for sex is certainly part of sexual abuse, but less obvious behaviors such as manipulating a child's emotions, using psychological tactics to gain control, or exploiting their vulnerabilities are equally damaging and should not be overlooked. Using a child for pornography is also sexual abuse. Most sexual abusers know the child they abuse and may even be perceived as trusted figures in the child's life, such as family friends, neighbors, or babysitters. In fact, up to 90% of abusers are well-known to the child. Most abusers are men, but this does not exclude women from being potential abusers. If you suspect a child may have been abused, it's crucial to approach the situation with sensitivity and care, as the child might not feel comfortable or safe coming forward with their experiences. Reporting suspected abuse to relevant authorities can be an important step in providing support and protection for the affected child."

        "question": "What to do for Lactose Intolerance ?",
        "right_answer": "People may find it helpful to talk with a health care provider or a registered dietitian about a dietary plan. A dietary plan can help people manage the symptoms of lactose intolerance and make sure they get enough nutrients. Parents, caretakers, childcare providers, and others who serve food to children with lactose intolerance should follow the dietary plan recommended by the childs health care provider or registered dietitian.\n                \nMilk and milk products. Gradually introducing small amounts of milk or milk products may help some people adapt to them with fewer symptoms. Often, people can better tolerate milk or milk products by having them with meals, such as having milk with cereal or having cheese with crackers. People with lactose intolerance are generally more likely to tolerate hard cheeses, such as cheddar or Swiss, than a glass of milk. A 1.5ounce serving of low-fat hard cheese has less than 1 gram of lactose, while a 1-cup serving of low-fat milk has about 11 to 13 grams of lactose.2\n                \nHowever, people with lactose intolerance are also more likely to tolerate yogurt than milk, even though yogurt and milk have similar amounts of lactose.2\n                \nLactose-free and lactose-reduced milk and milk products. Lactose-free and lactose-reduced milk and milk products are available at most supermarkets and are identical nutritionally to regular milk and milk products. Manufacturers treat lactose-free milk with the lactase enzyme. This enzyme breaks down the lactose in the milk. Lactose-free milk remains fresh for about the same length of time or, if it is ultra-pasteurized, longer than regular milk. Lactose-free milk may have a slightly sweeter taste than regular milk.\n                \nLactase products. People can use lactase tablets and drops when they eat or drink milk products. The lactase enzyme digests the lactose in the food and therefore reduces the chances of developing digestive symptoms.

Treatment may include the following:\n                \nAvoiding Alcohol and Illegal Substances\n                \nPeople with cirrhosis should not drink any alcohol or take any illegal substances, as both will cause more liver damage.\n                \nPreventing Problems with Medications\n                \nPeople with cirrhosis should be careful about starting new medications and should consult a health care provider before taking prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or vitamins. People with cirrhosis should avoid complementary and alternative medications, such as herbs.\n                \nCirrhosis slows the livers ability to filter medications from the blood. When this slowdown occurs, medications act longer than expected and build up in the body. Some medications and vitamins may also affect liver function.\n                \nViral Hepatitis Vaccination and Screening\n                \nAll people with cirrhosis should consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B. An infection with one of these hepatitis viruses can cause cirrhosis to get worse. Vaccination can easily prevent both infections.\n                \nPeople with cirrhosis should also get a screening blood test for hepatitis C.\n                \nTreating Causes of Cirrhosis\n                \nHealth care providers can treat some causes of cirrhosis, for example, by prescribing antiviral medications for hepatitis B and C. In some instances, these medications cure the viral infection. Health care providers treat autoimmune hepatitis with corticosteroids and other medications that suppress the immune system. Health care providers can treat hemochromatosis and Wilson diseaseinherited forms of liver disease caused by the buildup of iron or copper in the liverif detected early. Health care providers usually treat liver diseases due to blockage or loss of bile ducts with ursodiol (Actigall, Urso). Ursodiol is a nontoxic bile acid that people can take orally. Ursodiol replaces the bile acids that are normally produced by the liver, which are toxic and build up in the liver when the bile ducts are blocked.\n                \nTreating Symptoms and Complications of Cirrhosis\n                \nItching and abdominal pain. A health care provider may give medications to treat various symptoms of cirrhosis, such as itching and abdominal pain.\n                \nPortal hypertension. A health care provider may prescribe a beta-blocker or nitrate to treat portal hypertension. Beta-blockers lower blood pressure by helping the heart beat slower and with less force, and nitrates relax and widen blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart and reduce the hearts workload.\n                \nVarices. Beta-blockers can lower the pressure in varices and reduce the likelihood of bleeding. Bleeding in the stomach or esophagus requires an immediate upper endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto look for varices. The health care provider may use the endoscope to perform a band ligation, a procedure that involves placing a special rubber band around the varices that causes the tissue to die and fall off. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center. People who have had varices in the past may need to take medication to prevent future episodes.\n                \nEdema and ascites. Health care providers prescribe diureticsmedications that remove fluid from the bodyto treat edema and ascites. A health care provider may remove large amounts of ascitic fluid from the abdomen and check for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A health care provider may prescribe bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics to prevent infection. He or she may prescribe oral antibiotics; however, severe infection with ascites requires intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n                \nHepatic encephalopathy. A health care provider treats hepatic encephalopathy by cleansing the bowel with lactulose, a laxative given orally or as an enemaa liquid put into the rectum. A health care provider may also add antibiotics to the treatment. Hepatic encephalopathy may improve as other complications of cirrhosis are controlled.\n                \nHepatorenal syndrome. Some people with cirrhosis who develop hepatorenal syndrome must undergo regular dialysis treatment, which filters wastes and extra fluid from the body by means other than the kidneys. People may also need medications to improve blood flow through the kidneys.\n                \nOsteoporosis. A health care provider may prescribe bisphosphonate medications to improve bone density.\n                \nGallstones and bile duct stones. A health care provider may use surgery to remove gallstones. He or she may use endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which uses balloons and basketlike devices, to retrieve the bile duct stones.\n                \nLiver cancer. A health care provider may recommend screening tests every 6 to 12 months to check for signs of liver cancer. Screening tests can find cancer before the person has symptoms of the disease. Cancer treatment is usually more effective when the health care provider finds the disease early. Health care providers use blood tests, ultrasound, or both to screen for liver cancer in people with cirrhosis. He or she may treat cancer with a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.",

        "question": "What causes Causes of Diabetes ?",
        "right_answer": "Other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes.\n                \nGenetic Mutations Affecting Beta Cells, Insulin, and Insulin Action\n                \nSome relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin.\n                \nThe most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and MODY. NDM occurs in the first 6 months of life. MODY is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. More information about NDM and MODY is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Monogenic Forms of Diabetes.\n                \nOther rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors.\n                \nOther Genetic Diseases\n                \nDiabetes occurs in people with Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. Scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes.\n                \nThe genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. Cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. The risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\n                \nDamage to or Removal of the Pancreas\n                \nPancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\n                \nEndocrine Diseases\n                \nEndocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. Cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. Cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. The tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. Hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels.\n                \nAutoimmune Disorders\n                \nRare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. This kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. Another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes.\n                \nMedications and Chemical Toxins\n                \nSome medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. Pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. Also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. Glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis.\n                \nMany chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. For example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam Warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. In 2000, based on a report from the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which Vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. Some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. Arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes.\n                \nLipodystrophy\n                \nLipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body. The condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly\u2014over the course of several years\u2014and can be so mild that you might not even notice them. Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms. Some people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes-related health problems, such as blurred vision or\nheart trouble\n.\nWhat causes type 1 diabetes?\nType 1 diabetes\noccurs when your immune system, the body\u2019s system for fighting infection, attacks and destroys the\ninsulin\n-producing beta cells of the\npancreas\n. Scientists think type 1 diabetes is caused by\ngenes\nand environmental factors, such as viruses, that might trigger the disease. Studies such as\nTrialNet\nare working to pinpoint causes of type 1 diabetes and possible ways to prevent or slow the disease.\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes\n\u2014the most common form of diabetes\u2014is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes.\nOverweight, obesity, and physical inactivity\nYou are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you are not physically active and are\noverweight\nor have\nobesity\n. Extra weight sometimes causes\ninsulin resistance\nand is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and\nheart and blood vessel disease\n. To see if your weight puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes, check out these\nBody Mass Index (BMI) charts\n.\nInsulin resistance\nType 2 diabetes usually begins with\ninsulin resistance\n, a condition in which muscle,\nliver\n, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help\nglucose\nenter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can\u2019t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.\nGenes and family history\nAs in type 1 diabetes, certain genes may make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. The disease tends to run in families and occurs more often in these racial/ethnic groups:\nAfrican Americans\nAlaska Natives\nAmerican Indians\nAsian Americans\nHispanics/Latinos\nNative Hawaiians\nPacific Islanders\nGenes also can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing a person\u2019s tendency to become overweight or have obesity.\nWhat causes gestational diabetes?\nScientists believe\ngestational diabetes\n, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.\nInsulin resistance\nHormones\nproduced by the\nplacenta\ncontribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreas can\u2019t make enough insulin.\nAs with type 2 diabetes, extra weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Women who are overweight or have obesity may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.\nHormonal changes, extra weight, and family history can contribute to gestational diabetes.\nGenes and family history\nHaving a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. Genes may also explain why the disorder occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asians, and Hispanics/Latinas.\nWhat else can cause diabetes?\nGenetic mutations\n, other diseases, damage to the pancreas, and certain medicines may also cause diabetes.\nGenetic mutations\nMonogenic diabetes\nis caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These changes are usually passed through families, but sometimes the gene mutation happens on its own. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by making the pancreas less able to make insulin. The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Neonatal diabetes occurs in the first 6 months of life. Doctors usually diagnose MODY during adolescence or early adulthood, but sometimes the disease is not diagnosed until later in life.\nCystic fibrosis\nproduces thick mucus that causes scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin.\nHemochromatosis\ncauses the body to store too much iron.

        "context": "Low Blood Glucose (Hypoglycemia)\nWhat is low blood glucose?\nLow\nblood glucose\n, also called low blood sugar or hypoglycemia, occurs when the level of\nglucose\nin your blood drops below what is healthy for you. For many people with\ndiabetes\n, this means a blood glucose reading lower than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).\n1\nYour number might be different, so check with your doctor or health care team to find out what blood glucose level is low for you.\nHow common is low blood glucose?\nLow blood glucose is common among people with\ntype 1 diabetes\nand among people with\ntype 2 diabetes\nwho take\ninsulin\nor some other\ndiabetes medicines\n. In a large global study of people with diabetes who take insulin, 4 in 5 people with type 1 diabetes and nearly half of those with type 2 diabetes reported a low blood sugar event at least once over a 4-week period.\n2\nSeverely low blood glucose, defined as when your blood glucose level drops so low you can\u2019t treat it yourself, is less common. Among U.S. adults with diabetes who take insulin or some diabetes medicines that help the\npancreas\nrelease insulin into the blood, 2 in 100 may develop severely low blood glucose each year.\n3\nWho is more likely to develop low blood glucose?\nYou are more likely to develop low blood glucose if you\n4\nhave type 1 diabetes\ntake insulin or some other diabetes medicines\nare age 65 or older\n5\nhad low blood glucose before\nhave other health problems, such as\nkidney disease\n,\nheart disease\n, or\ncognitive impairment\nWhat are the symptoms of low blood glucose?\nSymptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly and can vary from person to person. As Table 1 below shows, symptoms can range from mild to severe.\nTable 1. Symptoms of low blood glucose\n6\nMild-to-Moderate\nSevere\nIf your blood glucose level is low, you may feel\nshaky or jittery\nhungry\ntired\ndizzy, lightheaded, confused, or irritable\nyour heart is beating too fast or not steadily\nyou have a headache\nyou can\u2019t see or speak clearly\nIf your blood glucose level is very low, your brain may stop working as it should. You may\nlose consciousness\nhave a seizure\nSevere hypoglycemia is dangerous and needs to be treated right away.\nLow blood glucose during sleep\nYour blood glucose level can drop while you sleep and stay low for several hours, causing serious problems.\n7\nSymptoms of low blood glucose while you sleep can include\ncrying out or having nightmares\nsweating enough to make your pajamas or sheets damp\nfeeling tired, irritable, or confused after waking up\nAlthough you may not wake up or notice any symptoms, low blood glucose can interfere with your sleep, which may affect your quality of life, mood, and ability to work. Having low blood glucose during sleep can also make you less likely to notice and respond to symptoms of low blood glucose during the day.\nWhat are the complications of low blood glucose?\nMild-to-moderate low blood glucose can be easily treated. But severely low blood glucose can cause serious complications, including passing out, coma, or death.\nRepeated episodes of low blood glucose can lead to\nhigh blood glucose levels, if worry or fear of low blood glucose keeps you from taking the medicines you need to manage your diabetes\n8\nhypoglycemia unawareness, a condition in which you don\u2019t notice any symptoms of low blood glucose until your blood glucose level has dropped very low\nWhat causes low blood glucose in people with diabetes?\nLow blood glucose levels can be a side effect of insulin or some other medicines that help your pancreas release insulin into your blood. Taking these can lower your blood glucose level.\nInsulin and some other diabetes medicines can lower your blood glucose level.\nTwo types of diabetes pills can cause low blood glucose\nsulfonylureas, usually taken once or twice per day, which increase insulin over several hours\nmeglitinides, taken before meals to promote a short-term increase in insulin\nThe following may also lower your blood glucose level\nNot eating or drinking enough\ncarbohydrates\n(carbs). When you eat foods or drink beverages that contain carbohydrates, your digestive system breaks down the sugars and starches into\nglucose\n. Glucose then enters your bloodstream and raises your blood glucose level. If you don\u2019t eat enough carbohydrates or skip or delay any meals, your blood glucose level could drop lower than what is healthy for you.\nFasting. Continuing to take medicines that lower your glucose level while fasting for a medical procedure or for other purposes can also increase the risk for low blood glucose.\nIncreasing physical activity. Increasing your physical activity level beyond your usual routine can lower your blood glucose level for up to 24 hours after the activity. Learn more about\ndiabetes, eating, and physical activity\n.\nDrinking too much alcohol without enough food. Alcohol makes it harder for your body to keep your blood glucose level steady, especially if you haven\u2019t eaten in a while. Alcohol can also keep you from feeling the first symptoms of low blood glucose, which can lead to severe symptoms.\nBeing sick.\nWhen you\u2019re sick\n, you may not be able to eat as much or keep food down, which can lower blood glucose.\nHow can I prevent low blood glucose if I have diabetes?\nIf you take insulin or other medicines that lower blood glucose, the following actions may help you prevent low blood glucose levels.\nAsk your doctor or health care team how to check your blood glucose level. The most common way to do so is by using a\nblood glucose meter\n. If you have hypoglycemia unawareness or have low blood glucose often, a\ncontinuous glucose monitor\n(CGM) may be a good option. The CGM measures your blood glucose level at regular times and can sound an alarm if it drops below your target range.\nMake sure your regular eating plan includes meals, snacks, and beverages with enough carbohydrates to help keep your blood glucose level in your target range. Carry a source of fast-acting carbohydrate, such as glucose tablets or a juice box, with you. Also, if you drink alcoholic beverages, it\u2019s safer to eat some food at the same time.\nBe safe during exercise or physical activity. Physical activity can lower your blood glucose during the activity and for hours afterward. You may need to check your blood glucose before, during, and after physical activity and adjust your medicine or carbohydrate intake to prevent low blood glucose. For example, you might eat a snack before physical activity to prevent low blood glucose.\nWork with your doctor or health care team to prevent low blood glucose. Ask your team if any of your diabetes medicines can cause low blood glucose and how you can prevent and treat symptoms. Work with your doctor or health care team to adjust your diabetes management plan as needed.\nSome CGMs let you track your blood glucose levels using a small sensor attached to your arm or abdomen and view the information on your smartphone.\nHow do I treat low blood glucose?\nIf your blood glucose is below your target, take 15 to 20 grams of glucose or carbohydrates right away.\nIf you begin to feel one or more symptoms of low blood glucose, check your blood glucose level. If your blood glucose level is below your target or less than 70 mg/dL, follow these steps\nEat or drink 15 to 20 grams of glucose or carbohydrates right away. Examples include\nfour glucose tablets or one tube of glucose gel.\n1/2 cup (4 ounces) of fruit juice\u2014not low-calorie or reduced-sugar juice. If you have kidney disease, don\u2019t drink orange juice because it has a lot of potassium. Apple, grape, or cranberry juice are good options.\n1/2 can (4 to 6 ounces) of soda\u2014not low-calorie or reduced-sugar soda.\n1 tablespoon of sugar, honey, or corn syrup.\nWait 15 minutes and check your blood glucose level again. If your glucose level is still low, eat or drink another 15 to 20 grams of glucose or carbohydrates.\nCheck your blood glucose level again after another 15 minutes. Repeat these steps until your glucose level is back to your target range.\nIf your next meal is more than 1 hour away, have a snack to keep your blood glucose level within a range that is healthy for you. Try crackers or a piece of fruit.\nTreating low blood glucose if you take medicines that slow down digestion\nSome diabetes medicines slow down the digestion of carbohydrates to keep blood glucose levels from rising too high after you eat. If you develop low blood glucose while taking these medicines, you will need to take glucose tablets or glucose gel right away. Eating or drinking other sources of carbohydrates won\u2019t raise your blood glucose level quickly enough.\nWhat if I have severe low blood glucose and can\u2019t treat myself?\nGlucagon\n\u2014a hormone that raises blood glucose levels\u2014is the best way to treat severely low blood glucose. Available as an injection or a nasal spray, glucagon will quickly raise your blood glucose level. Your doctor can prescribe you a glucagon kit for use in case of an emergency.\nIf your blood glucose level drops very low, you won\u2019t be able to treat it by yourself. Be prepared to address severely low blood glucose by\ntalking with your doctor or health care team about when and how to use a glucagon emergency kit. If you have an emergency kit, regularly check the date on the package to make sure it hasn\u2019t expired.\nteaching your family, friends, and coworkers when and how to give you glucagon. Tell them to call 911 right away after giving you glucagon or if you don\u2019t have a glucagon emergency kit with you.\nwearing a medical alert identification bracelet or pendant. A medical alert ID tells other people that you have diabetes and need care right away. Getting prompt care can help prevent the serious problems that low blood glucose levels can cause.\nClinical Trials for Low Blood Glucose\nThe NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including diabetes.

        "question": "What is (are) Hypothyroidism ?",
        "right_answer": "Hypothyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone to meet the bodys needs. Thyroid hormone regulates metabolismthe way the body uses energyand affects nearly every organ in the body. Without enough thyroid hormone, many of the bodys functions slow down. About 4.6 percent of the U.S. population age 12 and older has hypothyroidism.1",
        "context": "Hypothyroidism (Underactive Thyroid)\nWhat is hypothyroidism?\nHypothyroidism, also called underactive thyroid, is when the thyroid\ngland\ndoesn\u2019t make enough thyroid\nhormones\nto meet your body\u2019s needs. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. Thyroid hormones control the way your body uses energy, so they affect nearly every organ in your body, even the way your heart beats. Without enough thyroid hormones, many of your body\u2019s functions slow down.\nThe thyroid is a small gland in your neck that makes thyroid hormones.\nHow common is hypothyroidism?\nNearly 5 out of 100 Americans ages 12 years and older have hypothyroidism, although most cases are mild or have few obvious symptoms.\n1\nWho is more likely to develop hypothyroidism?\nWomen are much more likely than men to develop hypothyroidism. The disease is also more common among people older than age 60.\n1\nYou are more likely to have hypothyroidism if you\nhad a thyroid problem before, such as a\ngoiter\nhad surgery or radioactive iodine to correct a thyroid problem\nreceived\nradiation treatment\nto the thyroid, neck, or chest\nhave a family history of thyroid disease\nwere pregnant in the past 6 months\nhave\nTurner syndrome\n, a genetic disorder that affects women\nYour thyroid is also more likely to be underactive if you have other health problems, including\nCeliac disease\nSj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome\n, a disease that causes dry eyes and mouth\npernicious anemia\n, a condition caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency\ntype 1 or type 2 diabetes\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, an\nautoimmune disease\nthat affects the joints\nlupus\n, a\nchronic\nautoimmune\ninflammatory\ncondition\nIs hypothyroidism during pregnancy a problem?\nLeft untreated,\nhypothyroidism during pregnancy\ncan affect both mother and baby. However, thyroid medicines can help prevent problems and are safe to take during pregnancy. Many women taking thyroid hormone medicine need a higher dose during pregnancy, so contact your doctor right away if you find out you\u2019re pregnant.\nWhat are the complications of hypothyroidism?\nHypothyroidism can contribute to high\ncholesterol\n. If you have high cholesterol, you should get tested for hypothyroidism. Rarely, severe untreated hypothyroidism may lead to myxedema coma, an extreme form of hypothyroidism in which the body\u2019s functions slow to a life-threatening point. Myxedema coma requires immediate medical treatment.\nWhat are the symptoms of hypothyroidism?\nHypothyroidism has many symptoms that can vary from person to person. Some common symptoms of hypothyroidism include\nfatigue\nweight gain\ntrouble tolerating cold\njoint and muscle pain\ndry skin or dry, thinning hair\nheavy or irregular menstrual periods or fertility problems\nslowed heart rate\ndepression\nDry, thinning hair is one of many symptoms that might indicate hypothyroidism.\nBecause hypothyroidism develops slowly, you may not notice symptoms of the disease for months or even years.\nMany of these symptoms, especially fatigue and weight gain, are common and do not necessarily mean you have a thyroid problem.\nWhat causes hypothyroidism?\nHypothyroidism has several causes, including\nHashimoto\u2019s disease\nthyroiditis, or\ninflammation\nof the thyroid\ncongenital hypothyroidism, or hypothyroidism that is present at birth\nsurgical removal of part or all of the thyroid\nradiation treatment of the thyroid\nsome medicines\nLess often, hypothyroidism is caused by too much or too little\niodine in the diet\nor by disorders of the\npituitary gland\nor\nhypothalamus\n.\n1\nIodine deficiency, however, is extremely rare in the United States.\nHashimoto\u2019s disease\nHashimoto\u2019s disease, an\nautoimmune disorder\n, is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. With this disease, your\nimmune system\nattacks the thyroid. The thyroid becomes inflamed and can\u2019t make enough thyroid\nhormones\n.\nThyroiditis\nThyroiditis, an inflammation of your thyroid, causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of your thyroid gland. At first, the leakage increases your blood\u2019s hormone levels, leading to thyrotoxicosis, a condition in which thyroid hormone levels are too high. The thyrotoxicosis may last for many months. After that, your thyroid may become underactive and, over time, the condition may become permanent, requiring thyroid hormone replacement.\nThree types of thyroiditis can cause thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism.\n2\nSubacute thyroiditis involves a painfully inflamed and enlarged thyroid.\nPostpartum thyroiditis\ndevelops after a woman gives birth.\nSilent thyroiditis is painless, even though your thyroid may be enlarged. Experts think it is probably an autoimmune condition.\nCongenital hypothyroidism\nSome babies are born with a thyroid that is not fully developed or does not work properly. If untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to\nintellectual disability\nand growth failure\u2014when a baby doesn\u2019t grow as expected. Early treatment can prevent these problems. That\u2019s why most newborns in the United States are tested for hypothyroidism.\nSurgical removal of part or all of the thyroid\nWhen surgeons remove part of the thyroid, the remaining part may produce normal amounts of thyroid hormone. But some people who have this surgery may develop hypothyroidism. Removing the entire thyroid always results in hypothyroidism.\nSurgeons may remove part or all of the thyroid as a treatment for\nhyperthyroidism\na large goiter\nthyroid nodules, which are noncancerous tumors or lumps in the thyroid that can produce too much thyroid hormone\nsmall\nthyroid cancers\nRadiation treatment of the thyroid\nRadioactive iodine, a common treatment for hyperthyroidism, gradually destroys thyroid cells. If you receive radioactive iodine treatment, you probably will eventually develop hypothyroidism. Doctors also treat people who have head or neck cancers with\nexternal radiation therapy\n, which can also damage the thyroid if it is included in the treatment.\nMedicines\nSome medicines can interfere with thyroid hormone production and lead to hypothyroidism, including certain\nheart medicines\nbipolar disorder\nmedicines\ncancer medicines\nSeveral recently developed cancer medicines, in particular, can either affect the thyroid directly or affect it indirectly by damaging the pituitary gland.\nHow do doctors diagnose hypothyroidism?\nA blood test might confirm a diagnosis of hypothyroidism.\nYour doctor will take your medical history and perform a physical exam. A hypothyroidism diagnosis can\u2019t be based on symptoms alone because many of its symptoms are the same as those of other diseases.\n1\nThat\u2019s why your doctor may use several\nthyroid blood tests and imaging tests\nto confirm the diagnosis and find its cause.\nBecause hypothyroidism can cause fertility problems, women who have trouble getting pregnant often get tested for thyroid problems.\nHow do doctors treat hypothyroidism?\nHypothyroidism is treated by replacing the\nhormones\nthat your own thyroid can no longer make. You will take\nlevothyroxine\n, a thyroid hormone medicine identical to a hormone a healthy thyroid makes.\n3\nUsually prescribed in pill form, this medicine is also available as a liquid and as a soft gel capsule. These newer formulas may help people with digestive problems to absorb the thyroid hormone. Your doctor may recommend taking the medicine in the morning before eating.\nYour doctor will give you a blood test about 6 to 8 weeks after you begin taking the medicine, adjusting your dose if needed. Each time your dose is adjusted, you\u2019ll have another blood test. Once you\u2019ve reached a dose that\u2019s working for you, your doctor will probably repeat the blood test in 6 months and then once a year.\nYour hypothyroidism most likely can be completely controlled with thyroid hormone medicine, as long as you take the recommended dose as instructed. Never stop taking your medicine without talking with your doctor first. Taking too much thyroid hormone medicine can cause serious problems, such as\natrial fibrillation\nor\nosteoporosis\n.\n1\nHow does eating, diet, and nutrition affect hypothyroidism?\nYour thyroid uses iodine to make thyroid\nhormones\n. However, if you have\nHashimoto\u2019s disease\nor other types of\nautoimmune\nthyroid disorders, you may be sensitive to iodine\u2019s harmful side effects. Eating foods that have large amounts of iodine\u2014such as kelp, dulse, or other kinds of seaweed\u2014may cause or worsen hypothyroidism. Taking iodine supplements can have the same effect.\nTalk with members of your health care team\nabout what foods to limit or avoid\nif you take iodine supplements\nabout any cough syrups you take because they may contain iodine\nIf you are pregnant, you need more iodine because the baby gets iodine from your diet. Talk with your doctor about how much iodine you need.\nClinical Trials for Hypothyroidism\nThe NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including endocrine diseases.

As a result, many of your body\u2019s functions speed up.\nThe thyroid is a small gland in your neck that makes thyroid hormones.\nHow common is Graves\u2019 disease?\nGraves\u2019 disease affects nearly 1 in 100 Americans.\n1\nAbout 4 out of 5 cases of hyperthyroidism in the United States are caused by Graves\u2019 disease.\n1\nWho is more likely to have Graves\u2019 disease?\nGraves\u2019 disease is more common in women and people older than age 30.\n2\nYou are more likely to develop the disease if you\nhave a family history of Graves\u2019 disease or\nHashimoto\u2019s disease\nhave other autoimmune disorders, such as\n3,4\nvitiligo\n, which causes some parts of your skin to lose color\nautoimmune gastritis, which attacks the cells in your stomach lining\ntype 1 diabetes\n, which occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, which affects your joints and sometimes other parts of your body\nuse nicotine products\nWhat are the complications of Graves\u2019 disease?\nUntreated, Graves\u2019 disease can cause serious health problems, including\na rapid and irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots,\nstroke\n,\nheart failure\n, and other heart-related problems\nthinning bones,\nosteoporosis\n, and muscle problems\nproblems with the menstrual cycle, fertility, and\npregnancy\neye discomfort and changes in vision\nWhat are the symptoms of Graves\u2019 disease?\nGraves\u2019 disease often causes symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Graves\u2019 disease can also affect your eyes and skin. Symptoms can come and go over time.\nHyperthyroidism\nSymptoms of hyperthyroidism can vary from person to person and may include\n5\nweight loss, despite an increased appetite\nrapid or irregular heartbeat\nnervousness, irritability, trouble sleeping, fatigue\nshaky hands, muscle weakness\nsweating or trouble tolerating heat\nfrequent\nbowel movements\nan enlarged thyroid gland, called a\ngoiter\nSymptoms of hyperthyroidism may include trouble sleeping and fatigue.\nEye problems\nMore than 1 in 3 people with Graves\u2019 disease develop an eye disease called Graves\u2019 ophthalmopathy (GO).\n6\nGO occurs when your immune system attacks the muscles and other tissues around your eyes. Symptoms can include\nbulging eyes\ngritty, irritated eyes\npuffy eyes\nlight sensitivity\npressure or pain in the eyes\nblurred or double vision\nThese symptoms can start before or at the same time as symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Rarely, GO can develop after Graves\u2019 disease has been treated. You can develop GO even if your thyroid function is normal. Most people have mild symptoms.\nSkin problems\nRarely, people with Graves\u2019 disease develop a condition that causes the skin to become reddish and thick, with a rough texture. Called Graves\u2019 dermopathy or pretibial myxedema, the condition usually affects your shins but can also develop on the top of your feet and other parts of your body. Most cases are mild and painless.\nWhat causes Graves\u2019 disease?\nResearchers aren\u2019t sure why some people develop autoimmune disorders such as Graves\u2019 disease. These disorders probably develop from a combination of\ngenes\nand an outside trigger, such as a\nvirus\n.\nWith Graves\u2019 disease, your immune system makes an\nantibody\ncalled thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) that attaches to your thyroid cells. TSI acts like thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a hormone made in your\npituitary gland\nthat tells your thyroid how much thyroid hormone to make. TSI causes your thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone.\nHow do doctors diagnose Graves\u2019 disease?\nYour doctor will take your medical history and perform a physical exam to look for signs of Graves\u2019 disease. To confirm a diagnosis of Graves\u2019 disease, your doctor may order one or more of these thyroid tests\nBlood tests\n.\nThese tests can measure the levels of your thyroid hormones and also check for TSI.\nRadioactive iodine uptake test\n.\nThis test measures the amount of iodine your thyroid is taking up from your bloodstream to make thyroid hormones. If your thyroid is taking up large amounts of iodine, you may have Graves\u2019 disease.\nThyroid scan\n.\nThis test, often done together with the radioactive iodine uptake test, shows how and where iodine is distributed in your thyroid. With Graves\u2019 disease, the iodine shows up throughout the gland. With other causes of hyperthyroidism such as nodules\u2014small lumps in the gland\u2014the iodine shows up in a different pattern.\nDoppler blood flow measurement\n.\nThis test, also called Doppler ultrasound, uses sound waves to detect increased blood flow in your thyroid due to Graves\u2019 disease. Your doctor may order this test if radioactive iodine uptake is not a good option for you, such as during pregnancy or breastfeeding.\nHow do doctors treat Graves\u2019 disease?\nTreating hyperthyroidism\nHyperthyroidism is usually treated with medicines, radioiodine therapy, or thyroid surgery. Your doctor can help you identify the best option based on your age, health, symptoms, and other factors.\nExpand All\nMedicines\nBeta-blockers\n.\nBeta-blockers are drugs that block the action of substances, such as adrenaline, on nerve cells. They cause blood vessels to relax and widen.\nAntithyroid therapy is the easiest way to treat hyperthyroidism.\nPros\nThey can reduce symptoms\u2014such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness\u2014until other treatments start working.\nThey can make you feel better within hours.\nCons\nThey don\u2019t stop thyroid hormone production.\nAntithyroid medicines.\nAntithyroid therapy is the simplest way to treat hyperthyroidism. Methimazole is used most often. Propylthiouracil is often used for women during the first 3 months of\npregnancy\nbecause methimazole can, on rare occasions, harm the fetus.\nPros\nThey cause the thyroid to make less thyroid hormone.\nSome of your symptoms may go away temporarily after taking antithyroid drugs.\nCons\nAntithyroid medicines can cause side effects, including\nallergic reactions, such as rashes and itching\na decrease in the number of white blood cells in your body, which can lower resistance to infection\nliver failure\n, in rare cases\nAntithyroid medicines\nmay temporarily treat symptoms but are not a permanent cure for Graves\u2019 disease\nmay take several weeks or months for thyroid hormone levels to move into the normal range\ntake about 1\u20132 years total average treatment time, but can continue for many years\nSeek care right away\nWhile taking antithyroid drugs, call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms\nfatigue or weakness\ndull pain in your\nabdomen\nloss of appetite\nskin rash, itching, or easy bruising\nyellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes, called jaundice\nfever, chills, or constant sore throat\nRadioiodine therapy\nRadioiodine therapy is a common and effective treatment. You can take radioactive iodine-131 by mouth as a capsule or liquid.\nPros\nRadioiodine therapy slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone.\nIn the doses prescribed, radioiodine therapy does not affect other body tissues.\nCons\nYou might need more than one treatment to bring thyroid hormone levels into the normal range, but beta-blockers can control symptoms between treatments.\nRadioiodine therapy isn\u2019t used for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. It can harm the fetus\u2019 thyroid and can be passed from mother to child in breast milk.\nRadioiodine therapy may worsen symptoms of GO.\nAlmost everyone who gets radioiodine therapy later develops\nhypothyroidism\n. But hypothyroidism is easier to treat than hyperthyroidism by taking a daily thyroid hormone medicine, and it causes fewer long-term health problems.\nTaking radioactive iodine-131 is a common and effective treatment.\nThyroid surgery\nSurgery to remove part or most of the thyroid gland is used less often to treat hyperthyroidism. Sometimes doctors use surgery to treat people with large goiters or pregnant women who cannot take antithyroid medicines.\nIn some cases, doctors use surgery to remove part or most of the thyroid gland.\nPros\nWhen part of the thyroid is removed, your thyroid hormone levels may return to normal.\nCons\nThyroid surgery requires general\nanesthesia\n, which can lead to a condition called thyroid storm\u2014a sudden, severe worsening of symptoms if antithyroid medicines are not taken before surgery to prevent this problem.\nWhen part of your thyroid is removed, you may develop hypothyroidism after surgery and need to take thyroid hormone medicine. If your whole thyroid is removed, you will need to take thyroid hormone medicine for life. After surgery, your doctor will continue to check your thyroid hormone levels and will adjust your thyroid medicine dosage as needed.\nTreating GO\nMost cases of GO are mild. The following tips may help you control mild symptoms.\nEye drops can help relieve dry, gritty, irritated eyes.\nIf your eyelids do not fully close, taping them shut at night or wearing an eye mask can help prevent dry eyes.\nIf you have puffy eyelids, sleeping with your head raised may reduce swelling.\nSunglasses can help with light sensitivity.\nSpecial eyeglass lenses may help reduce double vision, if you have it.\nEye drops can relieve dry, gritty, irritated eyes.\nIf you have severe GO, your doctor may recommend\nsteroids\nor other medicines that reduce your body\u2019s immune response\nsurgery to improve bulging eyes or correct changes to your vision\nradiation therapy\nto the muscles and tissues around the eyes, used rarely\nGO often improves with treatment or even resolves on its own. But it can come back or get worse. Triggers include stressful life events and smoking.\n6\nSmoking makes GO worse. If you smoke or use other tobacco products, stop. Ask for help so you don\u2019t have to do it alone. You can start by calling the National Quitline at 1-800-QUITNOW or 1-800-784-8669. For tips on quitting, go to\nSmokefree.gov\n.\nHow do eating, diet, and nutrition affect Graves\u2019 disease?\nYour thyroid uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. If you have Graves\u2019 disease or another autoimmune thyroid disorder, you may be sensitive to harmful side effects from too much iodine in your diet. Eating foods that have large amounts of iodine\u2014such as kelp, dulse, or other kinds of seaweed\u2014may cause or worsen hyperthyroidism. Taking iodine supplements can have the same effect.\nTalk with your health care professional about\nwhat foods to limit or avoid\nany iodine supplements you take\nany cough syrups or multivitamins you take, because some may contain iodine\nClinical Trials for Graves\u2019 Disease\nThe NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including endocrine diseases. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.\nWhat are clinical trials for Graves\u2019 disease?\nClinical trials\u2014and other types of\nclinical studies\n\u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help doctors and researchers learn more about disease and improve health care for people in the future.\nResearchers are studying many aspects of Graves\u2019 disease, including new medicines for treating Graves\u2019 disease and GO.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.\nWhat clinical studies for Graves\u2019 disease are looking for participants?\nYou can view a filtered list of clinical studies on Graves\u2019 disease that are open and recruiting at\nwww.ClinicalTrials.gov\n. You can expand or narrow the list to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the National Institutes of Health does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe. Always talk with your health care provider before you participate in a clinical study.\n",
        "hallucinated_answer": "People with Graves disease may have symptoms such as feeling cold, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, and depression. They may also experience hair loss, muscle weakness, joint pain, and trouble concentrating. In addition, people with Graves disease may develop a goiter, which is an enlarged thyroid that can cause the neck to look swollen and interfere with normal breathing and swallowing. Some individuals with Graves disease may also experience difficulty in swallowing, hoarseness, and shortness of breath due to the enlarged thyroid compressing the airway. Graves ophthalmopathy (GO) is another common symptom of Graves disease, where the eyes appear to bulge out from their sockets due to inflammation and swelling around the eye muscles and tissues. This can cause double vision, light sensitivity, and irritation or itching in the eyes."

        "right_answer": "Insulin Resistance and Beta Cell Dysfunction\n                \nHormones produced by the placenta and other pregnancy-related factors contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Insulin resistance increases the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels. If the pancreas cant produce enough insulin due to beta cell dysfunction, gestational diabetes occurs.\n                \nAs with type 2 diabetes, excess weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Overweight or obese women are at particularly high risk for gestational diabetes because they start pregnancy with a higher need for insulin due to insulin resistance. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy may also increase risk.\n                \nFamily History\n                \nHaving a family history of diabetes is also a risk factor for gestational diabetes, suggesting that genes play a role in its development. Genetics may also explain why the disorder occurs more frequently in African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanics/Latinos. Many gene variants or combinations of variants may increase a womans risk for developing gestational diabetes.

However, women who have gestational diabetes are more likely to develop gestational diabetes with future pregnancies and develop type 2 diabetes.3 Women with gestational diabetes should be tested for persistent diabetes 6 to 12 weeks after delivery and at least every 3 years thereafter.\n                \nAlso, exposure to high glucose levels during gestation increases a childs risk for becoming overweight or obese and for developing type 2 diabetes later on. The result may be a cycle of diabetes affecting multiple generations in a family. For both mother and child, maintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active may help prevent type 2 diabetes.",
        "context": "Symptoms & Causes of Diabetes\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetes?\nSymptoms of\ndiabetes\ninclude\nincreased thirst and urination\nincreased hunger\nfatigue\nblurred vision\nnumbness or tingling in the feet or hands\nsores that do not heal\nunexplained weight loss\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes can start quickly, in a matter of weeks. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly\u2014over the course of several years\u2014and can be so mild that you might not even notice them. Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms. Some people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes-related health problems, such as blurred vision or\nheart trouble\n.\nWhat causes type 1 diabetes?\nType 1 diabetes\noccurs when your immune system, the body\u2019s system for fighting infection, attacks and destroys the\ninsulin\n-producing beta cells of the\npancreas\n. Scientists think type 1 diabetes is caused by\ngenes\nand environmental factors, such as viruses, that might trigger the disease. Studies such as\nTrialNet\nare working to pinpoint causes of type 1 diabetes and possible ways to prevent or slow the disease.\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes\n\u2014the most common form of diabetes\u2014is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes.\nOverweight, obesity, and physical inactivity\nYou are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you are not physically active and are\noverweight\nor have\nobesity\n. Extra weight sometimes causes\ninsulin resistance\nand is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and\nheart and blood vessel disease\n. To see if your weight puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes, check out these\nBody Mass Index (BMI) charts\n.\nInsulin resistance\nType 2 diabetes usually begins with\ninsulin resistance\n, a condition in which muscle,\nliver\n, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help\nglucose\nenter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can\u2019t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.\nGenes and family history\nAs in type 1 diabetes, certain genes may make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. The disease tends to run in families and occurs more often in these racial/ethnic groups:\nAfrican Americans\nAlaska Natives\nAmerican Indians\nAsian Americans\nHispanics/Latinos\nNative Hawaiians\nPacific Islanders\nGenes also can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing a person\u2019s tendency to become overweight or have obesity.\nWhat causes gestational diabetes?\nScientists believe\ngestational diabetes\n, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.\nInsulin resistance\nHormones\nproduced by the\nplacenta\ncontribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreas can\u2019t make enough insulin.\nAs with type 2 diabetes, extra weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Women who are overweight or have obesity may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.\nHormonal changes, extra weight, and family history can contribute to gestational diabetes.\nGenes and family history\nHaving a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. Genes may also explain why the disorder occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asians, and Hispanics/Latinas.\nWhat else can cause diabetes?\nGenetic mutations\n, other diseases, damage to the pancreas, and certain medicines may also cause diabetes.\nGenetic mutations\nMonogenic diabetes\nis caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These changes are usually passed through families, but sometimes the gene mutation happens on its own. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by making the pancreas less able to make insulin. The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Neonatal diabetes occurs in the first 6 months of life. Doctors usually diagnose MODY during adolescence or early adulthood, but sometimes the disease is not diagnosed until later in life.\nCystic fibrosis\nproduces thick mucus that causes scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin.\nHemochromatosis\ncauses the body to store too much iron. If the disease is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\nHormonal diseases\nSome hormonal diseases cause the body to produce too much of certain hormones, which sometimes cause insulin resistance and diabetes.\nCushing\u2019s syndrome\noccurs when the body produces too much\ncortisol\n\u2014often called the \u201cstress hormone.\u201d\nAcromegaly\noccurs when the body produces too much growth hormone.\nHyperthyroidism\noccurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.\nDamage to or removal of the pancreas\nPancreatitis\n, pancreatic cancer, and trauma can all harm the beta cells or make them less able to produce insulin, resulting in diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\nMedicines\nSometimes certain medicines can harm beta cells or disrupt the way insulin works. These include\nniacin, a type of vitamin B3\ncertain types of diuretics, also called water pills\nanti-seizure drugs\npsychiatric drugs\ndrugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (\nHIV\n)\npentamidine, a drug used to treat\na type of pneumonia\nglucocorticoids\u2014medicines used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n,\nasthma\n,\nlupus\n, and\nulcerative colitis\nanti-rejection medicines, used to help stop the body from rejecting a transplanted organ\nStatins, which are medicines to reduce LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol levels, can slightly increase the chance that you\u2019ll develop diabetes. However, statins help protect you from heart disease and stroke. For this reason, the strong benefits of taking statins outweigh the small chance that you could develop diabetes.\nIf you take any of these medicines and are concerned about their side effects, talk with your doctor.\nLast Reviewed November 2016\nShare\nthis page\nPrint\nFacebook\nX\nEmail\nMore Options\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nPinterest\nCopy Link\nPrevious:\nWhat Is Diabetes?\nNext:\nRisk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes\nThis content is provided as a service of the\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

Other causes can include diseases that affect other parts of the body, infections, some medicines, and genetics.\nPrimary nephrotic syndrome\nFour types of kidney disease can cause primary nephrotic syndrome in children and adolescents.\n2\nMinimal change disease\n(MCD). MCD is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in young children. The disease causes very little change to the glomeruli or nearby kidney tissue. The changes in the kidney can only be seen using an electron microscope, which shows tiny details. Although the cause of MCD is unknown, some health care professionals think the immune system may be involved.\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis\n(FSGS). This disease can cause some of the kidney\u2019s glomeruli to become scarred. FSGS may be caused by\ngenetic variants\n, or changes in\ngenes\npresent at birth.\nMembranous nephropathy\n(MN). MN is an autoimmune disease that causes immune proteins to build up in the kidney\u2019s glomerular basement membrane. As a result, the membrane becomes thick and does not work properly, allowing too much protein to pass into the urine.\nOther causes of primary nephrotic syndrome are uncommon.\nSecondary nephrotic syndrome\nCauses of secondary nephrotic syndrome in children include\n3\ndiseases that involve many organs or the whole body, called systemic diseases. Examples include\nIgA vasculitis\n(also known as Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura) and\nlupus\n.\ninfections, including\nhepatitis\nB and C,\nHIV\n, and\nmalaria\n.\ndiseases of the blood, such as\nleukemia\n,\nlymphoma\n, and\nsickle cell disease\n.\nsome medicines and drugs, such as\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n, and some medicines used to treat mood disorders, bone loss, or cancer.\nCongenital nephrotic syndrome\nAmong newborns and infants younger than 12 months old, the two most common causes of nephrotic syndrome are\n4\ngenetic variants, which account for most cases of congenital nephrotic syndrome\ninfections present at or before birth, such as\nsyphilis\nand\ntoxoplasmosis\nHow do health care professionals diagnose nephrotic syndrome in children?\nNephrotic syndrome in children is diagnosed with\na medical and family history\na physical exam\nurine tests\n, to look for excess urine proteins\nblood tests\n, to test kidney function and to look for underlying diseases\nAdditional tests to identify the cause of nephrotic syndrome may include\n3\nultrasound\nof the kidney\nkidney biopsy\ngenetic testing\nMany children with nephrotic syndrome will not need a kidney biopsy. The test is usually reserved for children who have complex disease, who have low kidney function, or who are 12 years old or older.\n3\nHow do health care professionals treat nephrotic syndrome in children?\nNephrotic syndrome in children is most often treated with medicines.\nPrimary nephrotic syndrome\nCorticosteroids.\nCorticosteroids, or steroids, are the medicines most often used to treat children with primary nephrotic syndrome. These medicines suppress the immune system, reduce the amount of protein passed into the urine, and decrease swelling.\nIn most children, treatment with corticosteroids will make nephrotic syndrome improve\u2014also called \u201cremission.\u201d If symptoms return, called a \u201crelapse,\u201d the health care professional may prescribe a shorter course of corticosteroids until the disease goes into remission again. Although children may have multiple relapses, they often recover without long-term kidney damage. In most cases, relapses happen less often as children get older.\n3\nAlthough corticosteroids effectively treat nephrotic syndrome in many children, using these medicines for long periods of time can cause side effects, such as impaired growth, obesity, high blood pressure, eye problems, and bone loss.\n3\nOther common side effects include anxiety, depression, and aggressive behavior. These problems are more likely to develop with larger doses and longer use.\nIn some cases, nephrotic syndrome may not improve with corticosteroids. Cases of nephrotic syndrome that don\u2019t respond to corticosteroids are more difficult to treat than those that do. They are also more likely to progress to\nend-stage kidney disease\n.\n3\nOther medicines that suppress the immune system.\nIf corticosteroids are not working or are causing harmful side effects, your child\u2019s health care professional may prescribe other medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system. In some cases, your child may take these medicines together with low-dose corticosteroids.\nMedicines for managing symptoms and complications.\nHealth care professionals may also prescribe other medicines to help your child manage the symptoms and complications of nephrotic syndrome. Examples include\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACEs) inhibitors\nor\nangiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)\nto lower blood pressure and help reduce protein loss\ndiuretics\n, or water pills, to reduce swelling by helping the kidneys remove extra fluid from the blood\nstatins\nto lower cholesterol\nblood thinners\nto treat blood clots\nChildren with nephrotic syndrome should get the\npneumococcal vaccine\nand yearly flu shots to prevent viral and bacterial infections. They should also get age-appropriate vaccinations. But the health care professional may delay certain \u201clive\u201d vaccines\u2014vaccines that use weakened forms of a virus\u2014while your child is taking certain medicines.\nSecondary nephrotic syndrome\nTreatment focuses on the cause of nephrotic syndrome. For example, the health care professional may\nprescribe\nantibiotics\nto treat an infection that may be causing nephrotic syndrome\nchange or stop any medicines your child takes that can cause nephrotic syndrome or make it worse, such as some medicines used to treat lupus, HIV, or\ndiabetes\nYour child\u2019s health care professional may also prescribe the same medicines used to manage the symptoms and complications of primary nephrotic syndrome.\nCongenital nephrotic syndrome\nTreatment varies depending on whether the cause is genetic or an infection.\nGenetic.\nYour child\u2019s treatment will depend on the type of genetic mutation that is causing nephrotic syndrome and how bad the symptoms and complications are. Many children will lose kidney function over time and ultimately need a\nkidney transplant\n. To keep your child healthy until the transplant, the health care professional may recommend\n4,5\nalbumin injections to make up for the albumin passed in urine\nmedicines to reduce swelling, lower blood pressure, and reduce protein loss\nremoval of one or both kidneys to decrease the loss of albumin in the urine\ndialysis\nto filter wastes from the blood if the kidneys fail or if both kidneys are removed\nInfection.\nWhen nephrotic syndrome is caused by a congenital infection, such as syphilis or toxoplasmosis, it will usually go away when the infection is treated.\n4\nHow can nephrotic syndrome in children be prevented?\nResearchers have not found a way to prevent nephrotic syndrome in children. Knowing the symptoms can help you get your child treated early and reduce the risk of complications.\nHow do eating, diet, and nutrition affect nephrotic syndrome in children?\nChildren who have nephrotic syndrome may need to\nchange what they eat and drink\n, such as\nlimiting the amount of sodium they get, often from salt\nreducing the amount of liquid they drink\neating foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol\nIn some cases, the child\u2019s health care professional may recommend other dietary changes. Parents or other caregivers should talk with their child\u2019s health care professional before making any changes to the child\u2019s diet.\nClinical Trials for Nephrotic Syndrome in Children\nThe NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including kidney diseases. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.\nWhy are clinical trials with children important?\nChildren respond to medicines and treatments differently than adults. The way to get the best treatments for children is through research designed specifically for them.\nWe have already made great strides in improving children's health outcomes through clinical trials\u2014and other types of\nclinical studies\n. Vaccines, treatments for children with cancer, and interventions for premature babies are just a few examples of how this targeted research can help. However, we still have many questions to answer and more children waiting to benefit.\nThe data gathered from trials and studies involving children help doctors and researchers\nfind the best dose of medicines for children\nfind treatments for conditions that only affect children\ntreat conditions that behave differently in children than in adults\nunderstand the differences in children as they grow\nHow do I decide if a clinical trial is right for my child?\nWe understand you have many questions, want to weigh the pros and cons, and need to learn as much as possible. Deciding to enroll in a study can be life changing for you and for your child. Depending on the outcome of the study, your child may find relief from their condition, see no benefit, or help to improve the health of future generations.\nTalk with your child and consider what would be expected. What could be the potential benefit or harm? Would you need to travel? Is my child well enough to participate? While parents or guardians must give their permission, or consent, for their children to join a study, the children must also agree to participate, if they are capable (verbal). In the end, no choice is right or wrong. Your decision is about what is best for your child.\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) is committed to ensuring you get all the information you need to feel comfortable and make informed decisions. The safety of children remains the utmost priority for all NIH research studies. For more resources to help decide if clinical trials are right for your child, visit\nClinical Trials and You: For Parents and Children\n.\nWhat aspects of nephrotic syndrome are being studied in children?\nResearchers study many aspects of nephrotic syndrome in children, such as the kidney diseases that can cause nephrotic syndrome in children and the genetic factors that can cause congenital nephrotic syndrome.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.\nWhat clinical studies for nephrotic syndrome are available for child participants?\nYou can view a filtered list of clinical studies on nephrotic syndrome in children that are federally funded, open, and recruiting at\nwww.ClinicalTrials.gov\n. You can expand or narrow the list to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the NIH does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe. If you find a trial you think may be right for your child, talk with your child\u2019s doctor about how to enroll.\n",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Childhood nephrotic syndrome is a rare condition that affects a small number of children. It occurs when the kidneys are damaged and cannot function properly. This causes protein to leak into the urine, resulting in symptoms such as swelling, weight gain or loss, and fatigue. Childhood nephrotic syndrome is not life-threatening if it is caught early enough and treated appropriately. However, it can lead to kidney failure if left untreated."

        "context": "Cushing's Syndrome\nWhat is Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nCushing\u2019s syndrome is a disorder that occurs when your body makes too much of the\nhormone\ncortisol over a long period of time. Cortisol is sometimes called the \u201cstress hormone\u201d because it helps your body respond to stress. Cortisol also helps\nmaintain\nblood pressure\nregulate\nblood glucose\n, also called blood sugar\nreduce\ninflammation\nturn the food you eat into energy\nThe adrenal glands, two small glands on top of your kidneys, make cortisol.\nThe adrenal glands, two small glands on top of your kidneys, make cortisol.\nHow common is Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nEndogenous Cushing\u2019s syndrome is rare. \u201cEndogenous\u201d means something inside your body is causing the disorder rather than something outside your body, such as medicine. Estimates vary, ranging from about 40 to 70 people out of every million.\n1\nWho is more likely to have Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nCushing\u2019s syndrome most often affects adults, usually aged 30 to 50,\n1\nbut can also occur in children. Cushing\u2019s syndrome affects about three times as many women as men.\n2\nIn people who have\ntype 2 diabetes\nand blood glucose levels that stay too high over time, along with high blood pressure, Cushing\u2019s syndrome may be the cause. People who take medicines called\nglucocorticoids\n, which are similar to cortisol, also can develop Cushing\u2019s syndrome. This type of Cushing\u2019s syndrome is called \u201cexogenous.\u201d More than 10 million Americans take glucocorticoids each year,\n3\nbut it\u2019s not known how many of them develop Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\nWhat are the complications of Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nCushing\u2019s syndrome can cause health problems such as\nheart attack\nand\nstroke\nblood clots in the legs and lungs\ninfections\nbone loss and fractures\nhigh blood pressure\nunhealthy\ncholesterol\nlevels\ndepression or other mood changes\nmemory loss or trouble concentrating\ninsulin resistance and prediabetes\ntype 2 diabetes\nAlthough Cushing\u2019s syndrome can usually be cured, it can be fatal if not treated.\nWhat are the symptoms of Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nSigns and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome vary. People who have very high levels of cortisol for a long time are likely to have clear signs of the disorder, including\nweight gain\nthin arms and legs\na round face\nincreased fat around the base of the neck\na fatty hump between the shoulders\neasy bruising\nwide purple stretch marks, mainly on the\nabdomen\n, breasts, hips, and under the arms\nweak muscles\nChildren with Cushing\u2019s syndrome tend to have\nobesity\nand grow more slowly than other children. Women may have excess hair on their face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thighs. Menstrual periods may become irregular or stop. Men may have decreased fertility with lowered interest in sex and may have\nerectile dysfunction\n.\nNot everyone with Cushing\u2019s syndrome has these symptoms, which can make it hard to detect.\nWhat causes Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nThe most common cause of Cushing\u2019s syndrome is the long-term, high-dose use of the cortisol-like glucocorticoids. These medicines are used to treat other medical conditions, such as\nasthma\n,\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, and\nlupus\n. Glucocorticoids are often injected into a joint to treat pain. Use of glucocorticoids also suppresses the\nimmune system\nafter an organ transplant to keep the body from rejecting the new organ.\nOther people develop endogenous Cushing\u2019s syndrome because their bodies make too much cortisol.  Several types of tumors can cause the body to make excess cortisol.\nPituitary tumors\nPituitary tumors, also called pituitary adenomas, are noncancerous growths on the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain and is about the size of a pea. The pituitary makes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and other hormones. ACTH tells the adrenal glands to make cortisol. These pituitary tumors make too much ACTH, causing the adrenals to make too much cortisol.\nThe pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain.\nPituitary tumors that make too much ACTH cause 8 out of 10 cases of Cushing\u2019s syndrome\n2\nnot caused by glucocorticoid medicines. Doctors call this type of Cushing\u2019s syndrome Cushing\u2019s disease.\nEctopic ACTH-producing tumors\nSome tumors that develop outside the pituitary gland also can produce ACTH. This condition is called ectopic ACTH syndrome. Most often, these tumors occur in the lungs. Ectopic tumors also can occur in the\npancreas\n,\nthyroid\n, and thymus\u2014a gland that helps build a healthy immune system. Ectopic tumors may be cancerous.\nAdrenal tumors\nSometimes a tumor on the adrenal gland itself makes too much cortisol. Adrenal tumors are most often benign but sometimes are cancerous.\nHow do doctors diagnose Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nCushing\u2019s syndrome can be hard to diagnose. Symptoms such as fatigue and weight gain can have many different causes. Cushing\u2019s syndrome may be mistaken for other conditions that have many of the same signs, such as\npolycystic ovary syndrome\nor\nmetabolic syndrome\n. Your doctor will first want to rule out other conditions.\nDiagnosis is based on your medical history, a physical exam, and lab tests. Your doctor may ask if you are taking glucocorticoids or have had injections and rule that out before ordering lab tests.\nDoctors may use urine, saliva, or blood tests to diagnose Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Sometimes doctors run a follow-up test to find out if excess cortisol is caused by Cushing\u2019s syndrome or has a different cause.\nNo one test is perfect, so doctors usually do two of the following tests to confirm a diagnosis:\n24-hour urinary free-cortisol test\nIn this test, you will collect your urine over a 24-hour period. Your health care professional will send your urine sample to a lab to test cortisol levels. Higher than normal cortisol levels suggest Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\nLate-night salivary cortisol test\nThis test measures the amount of cortisol in your saliva in the late evening. Normally, cortisol production drops just after we fall asleep. In Cushing\u2019s syndrome, cortisol levels don\u2019t drop. You can collect your saliva sample at home and return it to your health care professional or send it to a lab for testing.\nLow-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST)\nIn this test, you will take a low dose of dexamethasone, a type of glucocorticoid, usually around 11:00 p.m. A health care professional will draw your blood the following morning, usually around 8 a.m. Sometimes doctors use another type of LDDST test, in which you take dexamethasone every 6 hours for 48 hours. Your blood is drawn 6 hours after the last dose.\nNormally, cortisol levels in the blood drop after taking dexamethasone. Cortisol levels that don\u2019t drop suggest Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\nIn the LDDST test, you will have blood drawn after taking a low dose of dexamethasone.\nWhen one of the first blood tests show that your body has too much cortisol, your doctor may order a follow-up test, called the dexamethasone\u2013corticotropin-releasing hormone (dexamethasone-CRH) test.\nDexamethasone\u2013CRH test\nThe dexamethasone-CRH test shows whether excess cortisol is caused by Cushing\u2019s syndrome or by something else.\nSome people have high cortisol levels off and on but don\u2019t develop the long-term health effects of Cushing's syndrome. These people may have pseudo-Cushing's syndrome, a condition sometimes found in people who have depression or anxiety, drink too much alcohol, have diabetes with blood glucose levels that are often too high, or have obesity.\nThis test combines the LDDST and a CRH stimulation test. CRH is a hormone made in the part of the brain called the hypothalamus. CRH tells the pituitary to make ACTH, which in turn tells the adrenals to make cortisol.  When cortisol levels rise enough, they turn off the CRH signal, so ACTH and cortisol levels fall.\nCRH tells the pituitary to make ACTH, which in turn tells the adrenals to make cortisol.\nYou\u2019ll get a shot of CRH and take dexamethasone by mouth. If you have pseudo-Cushing\u2019s syndrome, the dexamethasone will decrease ACTH and cortisol levels and keep them from rising. Cortisol levels that are high just before the CRH shot or rise during this test suggest Cushing's syndrome.\nHow do doctors find the cause of Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nOnce your doctor diagnoses Cushing\u2019s syndrome, other tests can help tell whether the source of the problem is pituitary, ectopic, or adrenal. Knowing the source is important in choosing the best type of treatment.\nBlood tests\nThe first step is to measure ACTH levels in the blood. If ACTH levels are low, the cause is probably an adrenal tumor. People with adrenal tumors don\u2019t need further blood tests.\nIf ACTH levels are normal or high, the cause is probably a pituitary or ectopic tumor.\nOther blood tests help tell pituitary tumors from ectopic tumors. Doctors usually do more than one test.\nCRH stimulation test.\nFor this test, you\u2019ll get a shot of CRH. If you have a pituitary tumor, CRH will increase the ACTH and cortisol in your blood. This rarely happens in people with ectopic tumors.\nHigh-dose dexamethasone suppression test (HDDST).\nThis test is the same as the LDDST, except it uses higher doses of dexamethasone. If the cortisol levels in your blood drop after taking a high dose of dexamethasone, you probably have a pituitary tumor. If your cortisol levels don\u2019t drop, you may have an ectopic tumor.\nOther tests\nOther tests look for tumors and help tell pituitary tumors from ectopic tumors.\nImaging tests.\nImaging tests show the size and shape of the pituitary and adrenal glands and look for tumors. If blood tests show that the tumor is ectopic, imaging tests can help locate the tumor. The most common imaging tests are the\ncomputerized tomography (CT) scan\nand\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n.\nThe most common imaging tests are CT scans and MRI.\nPetrosal sinus sampling.\nPituitary tumors are usually small and may not show up in an imaging test. If an MRI doesn\u2019t show a pituitary tumor, you might have petrosal sinus sampling. This test is often the best way to tell pituitary from ectopic causes of Cushing's syndrome.\nYour doctor will draw samples of blood from your petrosal sinuses\u2014veins that drain the pituitary. At the same time, you will have a blood sample taken from a blood vessel far away from the pituitary. You will also get a shot of CRH, the hormone that causes the pituitary to release ACTH.\nHigher levels of ACTH in the blood from the petrosal sinuses than from the other blood vessel indicate a pituitary tumor. Similar levels of ACTH in all the blood samples suggest an ectopic tumor.\nHow do doctors treat Cushing\u2019s syndrome?\nTreatment depends on the cause and may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or cortisol-reducing medicines. If the cause is long-term use of glucocorticoids to treat another disorder, your doctor will gradually reduce your dosage to the lowest dose that will control that disorder. Sometimes disorders that doctors treat with glucocorticoids can be treated with a non-glucocorticoid medicine instead.\nPituitary tumors\nThe most common treatment for pituitary tumors is surgery to remove the tumor. Using a special microscope and fine instruments, a surgeon approaches the pituitary gland through a nostril or an opening made below the upper lip. Your doctor will probably refer you to a center specializing in this type of surgery.\nThe success, or cure, rate of this surgery can be as high as 90 percent when done by a highly experienced surgeon.\n4\nIf surgery fails or the cure doesn\u2019t last, surgery can be repeated, often with good results.\nSurgery to remove a pituitary tumor is usually successful with an experienced surgeon.\nAfter the surgeon removes the tumor, your pituitary won\u2019t make enough ACTH for a while. Your doctor will prescribe cortisol medicine since there\u2019s not enough ACTH to tell the adrenal glands to make enough cortisol. You may be able to stop cortisol medicine in 6 to 18 months.\nIf surgery fails or isn\u2019t possible, radiation therapy is an option. One type of radiation therapy uses small doses of radiation to the pituitary over a 6-week period. Another type uses a single, high dose of radiation. Cortisol levels may not return to normal after radiation therapy for several years. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to bring cortisol levels back to normal until radiation therapy takes effect.\nEctopic ACTH-producing tumors\nThe first choice of treatment for ectopic tumors is to remove them surgically. If the tumor is cancerous and has spread, you may need chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other cancer treatments. Medicines to reduce cortisol levels may also be part of your treatment. If other treatments fail, surgeons might have to remove the adrenal glands to control Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\nAdrenal tumors\nSurgery to remove the adrenal gland with the tumor is the most common treatment. Some rare diseases cause many nodules in both adrenal glands and require surgery to remove both glands. If you have both adrenal glands removed, you will need to take medicine for life to replace cortisol and other hormones the adrenal glands make.\nClinical Trials\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions.\nWhat are clinical trials, and are they right for you?\nClinical trials are part of clinical research and at the heart of all medical advances. Clinical trials look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease. Researchers also use clinical trials to look at other aspects of care, such as improving the quality of life for people with chronic illnesses.\nFind out if clinical trials are right for you\n.\nWhat clinical trials are open?\nClinical trials that are currently open and are recruiting can be viewed at\nwww.ClinicalTrials.gov\n.\n",

        "question": "How to diagnose Kidney Disease of Diabetes ?",
        "right_answer": "People with diabetes should be screened regularly for kidney disease. The two key markers for kidney disease are eGFR and urine albumin.\n                \n-  eGFR. eGFR stands for estimated glomerular filtration rate. Each kidney contains about 1 million tiny filters made up of blood vessels. These filters are called glomeruli. Kidney function can be checked by estimating how much blood the glomeruli filter in a minute. The calculation of eGFR is based on the amount of creatinine, a waste product, found in a blood sample. As the level of creatinine goes up, the eGFR goes down.  Kidney disease is present when eGFR is less than 60 milliliters per minute.  The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommend that eGFR be calculated from serum creatinine at least once a year in all people with diabetes.  -  Urine albumin. Urine albumin is measured by comparing the amount of albumin to the amount of creatinine in a single urine sample. When the kidneys are healthy, the urine will contain large amounts of creatinine but almost no albumin. Even a small increase in the ratio of albumin to creatinine is a sign of kidney damage.  Kidney disease is present when urine contains more than 30 milligrams of albumin per gram of creatinine, with or without decreased eGFR.

        "context": "Diabetic Kidney Disease\nWhat is diabetic kidney disease?\nDiabetic kidney disease is a type of\nkidney disease\ncaused by\ndiabetes\n.\nDiabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease. About 1 out of 3 adults with diabetes has kidney disease.\n1\nThe main job of the\nkidneys\nis to filter wastes and extra water out of your blood to make urine. Your kidneys also help control blood pressure and make\nhormones\nthat your body needs to stay healthy.\nYour kidneys are located in the middle of your back, just below your rib cage.\nWhen your kidneys are damaged, they can\u2019t filter blood like they should, which can cause wastes to build up in your body. Kidney damage can also cause other health problems.\nKidney damage caused by diabetes usually occurs slowly, over many years. You can take steps to protect your kidneys and to prevent or delay kidney damage.\nWatch a video about diabetes and kidney disease\n.\nWhat are other names for diabetic kidney disease?\nDiabetic kidney disease is also called DKD, chronic kidney disease, CKD, kidney disease of diabetes, or diabetic nephropathy.\nHow does diabetes cause kidney disease?\nHigh\nblood glucose\n, also called blood sugar, can damage the\nblood vessels\nin your kidneys. When the blood vessels are damaged, they don\u2019t work as well. Many people with diabetes also develop\nhigh blood pressure\n, which can also damage your kidneys. Learn more about\nhigh blood pressure and kidney disease\n.\nWhat increases my chances of developing diabetic kidney disease?\nHaving diabetes for a longer time increases the chances that you will have kidney damage. If you have diabetes, you are more likely to develop kidney disease if your\nblood glucose is too high\nblood pressure is too high\nAfrican Americans, American Indians, and Hispanics/Latinos develop diabetes, kidney disease, and\nkidney failure\nat a higher rate than Caucasians.\nYou are also more likely to develop kidney disease if you have diabetes and\nsmoke\ndon\u2019t follow your diabetes eating plan\neat foods high in salt\nare not active\nare overweight\nhave\nheart disease\nhave a family history of kidney failure\nIf you have diabetes, you are more likely to develop kidney disease if you have high blood pressure.\nHow can I tell if I have diabetic kidney disease?\nMost people with diabetic kidney disease do not have symptoms. The only way to know if you have diabetic kidney disease is to get your kidneys checked.\nHealth care professionals use\nblood and urine tests\nto check for diabetic kidney disease. Your health care professional will check your urine for\nalbumin\nand will also do a blood test to see how well your kidneys are filtering your blood.\nYou should get tested every year for kidney disease if you\nhave\ntype 2 diabetes\nhave had\ntype 1 diabetes\nfor more than 5 years\nHealth care professionals use blood and urine tests to check for kidney disease.\nHow can I keep my kidneys healthy if I have diabetes?\nThe best way to slow or prevent diabetes-related kidney disease is to try to reach your blood glucose and blood pressure goals. Healthy lifestyle habits and taking your medicines as prescribed can help you achieve these goals and improve your health overall.\nReach your blood glucose goals\nYour health care professional will\ntest your A1C\n. The A1C is a blood test that shows your average blood glucose level over the past 3 months. This is different from the blood glucose checks that you may do yourself. The higher your A1C number, the higher your blood glucose levels have been during the past 3 months.\nThe A1C goal for many people with diabetes is below 7 percent. Ask your health care team what your goal should be. Reaching your goal numbers will help you protect your kidneys.\nTo reach your A1C goal, your health care professional may ask you to check your blood glucose levels. Work with your health care team to use the results to guide decisions about food, physical activity, and medicines. Ask your health care team how often you should\ncheck your blood glucose\nlevel.\nProtect your kidneys by keeping your blood glucose under control.\nControl your blood pressure\nBlood pressure is the force of your blood against the wall of your blood vessels. High blood pressure makes your heart work too hard. It can cause heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease.\nYour health care team will also work with you to help you set and reach your blood pressure goal. The blood pressure goal for most people with diabetes is below 140/90 mm Hg. Ask your health care team what your goal should be.\nProtect your kidneys by keeping your blood pressure under control.\nMedicines that lower blood pressure can also help slow kidney damage. Two types of blood pressure medicines,\nACE inhibitors\nand\nARBs\n, play a special role in protecting your kidneys. Each has been found to slow kidney damage in people with diabetes who have high blood pressure and DKD. The names of these medicines end in \u2013pril or \u2013sartan. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not safe for women who are pregnant.\nDevelop or maintain healthy lifestyle habits\nHealthy lifestyle habits can help you reach your blood glucose and blood pressure goals. Following the steps below will also help you keep your kidneys healthy\nStop smoking.\nWork with a dietitian to develop a diabetes meal plan and limit salt and\nsodium\n.\nMake physical activity part of your routine.\nStay at or get to a healthy weight.\nGet enough sleep. Aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night.\nLearn more about these tips to\nmanage diabetes\n.\nTake medicines as prescribed\nMedicines may be an important part of your treatment plan. Your health care professional will prescribe medicine based on your specific needs. Medicine can help you meet your blood glucose and blood pressure goals. You may need to take more than one kind of medicine to control your blood pressure.\nTalk to your health care professional or pharmacist about all of the medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines.\nHow can I cope with the stress of managing my diabetes?\nManaging diabetes isn\u2019t always easy. Feeling stressed, sad, or angry is common when you are living with diabetes. You may know what to do to stay healthy but may have trouble sticking with your plan over time. Long-term stress can raise your blood glucose and blood pressure, but you can learn ways to lower your stress. Try deep breathing, gardening, taking a walk, doing yoga, meditating, doing a hobby, or listening to your favorite music. Learn more about healthy ways to\ncope with stress\n.\nDoes diabetic kidney disease get worse over time?\nKidney damage from diabetes can get worse over time. However, you can take steps to keep your kidneys healthy and help slow kidney damage to prevent or delay\nkidney failure\n. Kidney failure means that your kidneys have lost most of their ability to function\u2014less than 15 percent of normal kidney function. However, most people with diabetes and kidney disease don\u2019t end up with kidney failure.\nIf your kidneys become damaged as a result of diabetes, learn how to\nmanage kidney disease\n.\n",
        "hallucinated_answer": "People with diabetes should be screened regularly for kidney disease. The two key markers for kidney disease are eGFR and urine albumin.\n-  eGFR. eGFR stands for estimated glomerular filtration rate. Each kidney contains about 1 million tiny filters made up of blood vessels. These filters are called glomeruli. Kidney function can be checked by estimating how much blood the glomeruli filter in a minute. The calculation of eGFR is based on the amount of creatinine, a waste product, found in a blood sample. As the level of creatinine goes up, the eGFR goes down.  Kidney disease is present when eGFR is less than 60 milliliters per minute.  The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommend that eGFR be calculated from serum creatinine at least once a year in all people with diabetes.  -  Urine albumin. Urine albumin is measured by comparing the amount of albumin to the amount of creatinine in a single urine sample. When the kidneys are healthy, the urine will contain large amounts of creatinine but almost no albumin. Even a small increase in the ratio of albumin to creatinine is a sign of kidney damage.  Kidney disease is present when urine contains more than 30 milligrams of albumin per gram of creatinine, with or without decreased eGFR.

        "question": "What to do for Primary Hyperparathyroidism ?",
        "right_answer": "- Primary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder of the parathyroid glands, in which one or more of the parathyroid glands are overactive. As a result, the gland releases too much parathyroid hormone (PTH).  - High PTH levels trigger the bones to release increased calcium into the blood, causing blood calcium levels to rise above normal. T he loss of calcium from bones may weaken the bones. In response to high blood calcium levels, the kidneys excrete more calcium in the urine, which can lead to kidney stones.  - Most people with primary hyperparathyroidism have no symptoms. When symptoms appear, they are often mild and nonspecific, such as muscle weakness, fatigue, increased need for sleep, feelings of depression, or aches and pains in bones and joints.  - People with more severe primary hyperparathyroidism may have symptoms such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, confusion or impaired thinking and memory, and increased thirst and urination.  - Health care providers diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism when a person has high blood calcium and PTH levels.  - Surgery to remove the overactive parathyroid gland or glands is the only definitive treatment for the disorder. When performed by experienced endocrine surgeons, surgery cures primary hyperparathyroidism in more than 95 percent of operations. Some people who have mild primary hyperparathyroidism may not need immediate or even any surgery and can be safely monitored. People with primary hyperparathyroidism due to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia should not have surgery.",
        "context": "Primary Hyperparathyroidism\nWhat is primary hyperparathyroidism?\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder of the parathyroid glands, four pea-sized glands located on or near the thyroid gland in the neck. \u201cPrimary\u201d means this disorder begins in the parathyroid glands, rather than resulting from another health problem such as\nkidney failure\n. In primary hyperparathyroidism, one or more of the parathyroid glands is overactive. As a result, the gland makes too much parathyroid\nhormone\n(PTH).\nToo much PTH causes\ncalcium\nlevels in your blood to rise too high, which can lead to health problems such as bone thinning and kidney stones. Doctors usually catch primary hyperparathyroidism early through routine blood tests, before serious problems occur.\nView full-sized image\nThe parathyroid glands are located on or near the thyroid gland in the neck.\nWhat do the parathyroid glands do?\nThe parathyroid glands\u2019 only purpose is to make PTH, which helps maintain the right balance of calcium in your body. PTH raises blood calcium levels by\ncausing bone, where most of your body\u2019s calcium is stored, to release calcium into the blood\nhelping your intestines absorb calcium from food\nhelping your\nkidneys\nhold on to calcium and return it to your blood instead of flushing it out in urine\nWhen the level of calcium in your blood falls too low, the parathyroid glands release just enough PTH to bring your blood calcium levels back to normal.\nYou need calcium for good health. This mineral helps build bones and teeth and keep them strong. Calcium also helps your heart, muscles, and nerves work normally.\nAlthough their names are similar, the parathyroid glands and the thyroid gland are not related.\nHow common is primary hyperparathyroidism?\nIn the United States, about 100,000 people develop primary hyperparathyroidism each year.\n1\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is one of the most common hormonal disorders.\nWho is more likely to develop primary hyperparathyroidism?\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism most often affects people between age 50 and 60. Women are affected 3 to 4 times more often than men.\n1\nThe disorder was more common in African Americans, followed by Caucasians, in one large study performed in North America.\n1\nWhat are the complications of primary hyperparathyroidism?\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism most often affects the bones and kidneys, although it also may play a part in other health problems.\nWeakened bones\nHigh PTH levels trigger the bones to release more calcium than normal into the blood. The loss of calcium from the bones may weaken them.\nKidney stones\nThe\nsmall intestine\nmay absorb more calcium from food, adding to high levels of calcium in your blood. Extra calcium that isn\u2019t used by your bones and muscles goes to your kidneys and is flushed out in urine. Too much calcium in your urine can cause\nkidney stones\n.\nOther complications\nHigh blood calcium levels might play a part in other problems, such as\nheart disease\n,\nhigh blood pressure\n, and trouble concentrating. However, more research is needed to better understand how primary hyperparathyroidism affects the heart,\nblood vessels\n, and brain.\nWhat are the symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism?\nMost people with primary hyperparathyroidism have no symptoms. When symptoms appear, they\u2019re often mild and similar to those of many other disorders. Symptoms include\nmuscle weakness\nfatigue\ndepression\naches and pains in bones and joints\nView full-sized image\nSymptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism\nPeople with more severe disease may have\nloss of appetite\nnausea\nvomiting\nconstipation\nconfusion\nincreased thirst and urination\nWhat causes primary hyperparathyroidism?\nIn about 8 out of 10 people with primary hyperparathyroidism, a benign, or noncancerous, tumor called an adenoma has formed in one of the parathyroid glands.\n2\nThe tumor causes the gland to become overactive. In most other cases, extra PTH comes from two or more adenomas or from hyperplasia, a condition in which all four parathyroid glands are enlarged. People with rare inherited conditions that affect the parathyroid glands, such as\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1\nor\nfamilial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia\n, are more likely to have more than one gland affected.\nRarely, primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by cancer of a parathyroid gland.\nHow do doctors diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism?\nDoctors diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism when a blood test shows high blood calcium and PTH levels. Sometimes PTH levels are in the upper portion of the normal range, when they should drop to low-normal or below normal in response to high calcium levels. Other conditions can cause high calcium, but elevated PTH is the only source in primary hyperparathyroidism.\nRoutine blood tests can detect high blood calcium levels. High blood calcium may cause health care professionals to suspect hyperparathyroidism, even before symptoms appear.\nSometimes PTH levels are high but calcium levels are not. Doctors don\u2019t routinely test for PTH but may do so if you have\nosteoporosis\nor another disorder that affects bone strength. In some cases, this may be the first phase of primary hyperparathyroidism, before calcium levels start to rise.\nOnce doctors diagnose hyperparathyroidism, a 24-hour urine collection can help find the cause. This test measures certain chemicals, such as calcium and creatinine, a waste product that healthy kidneys remove. You will collect your urine over a 24-hour period and your health care professional will send it to a lab for analysis. Results of the test may help tell primary hyperparathyroidism from hyperparathyroidism caused by a kidney disorder. The test can also rule out familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, a rare genetic disorder, as a cause.\nWhat tests do doctors use to look for complications of primary hyperparathyroidism?\nOnce doctors diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism, they may use other tests to look for bone weakness, kidney problems, and low levels of\nvitamin D\n.\nBone mineral density test\nDual energy x-ray absorptiometry, also called a DXA or DEXA scan, uses low-dose\nx-rays\nto measure\nbone density\n. During the test, you will lie on a padded table while a technician moves the scanner over your body. A bone expert or\nradiologist\nwill read the scan.\nDuring a DXA scan, you will lie on a padded table while a technician moves the scanner over your body.\nKidney imaging tests\nDoctors may use one of the following imaging tests to look for kidney stones.\nUltrasound.\nUltrasound uses a device called a transducer that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician does the procedure. A radiologist reads the images, which can show kidney stones.\nAbdominal x-ray.\nAn abdominal x-ray is a picture of the\nabdomen\nthat uses low levels of radiation and is recorded on film or on a computer. During an abdominal x-ray, you lie on a table or stand up. A technician positions the x-ray machine close to your abdomen and asks you to hold your breath so the picture won\u2019t be blurry. A radiologist reads the x-ray, which can show the location of kidney stones in the\nurinary tract\n. Not all stones are visible on an abdominal x-ray.\nComputed tomography (CT) scans.\nCT scans use a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images of your urinary tract. CT scans sometimes use a contrast medium\u2014a dye or other substance that makes structures inside your body easier to see. Contrast medium isn\u2019t usually needed to see kidney stones. For the scan, you\u2019ll lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped machine that takes the x-rays. A radiologist reads the images, which can show the size and location of a kidney stone.\nVitamin D blood test\nHealth care professionals test for vitamin D levels because low levels are common in people with primary hyperparathyroidism. In patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the low vitamin D level can further stimulate the parathyroid glands to make even more parathyroid hormone. Also, a very low vitamin D level may cause a secondary form of hyperparathyroidism, which resolves when vitamin D levels are returned to normal.\nHow do doctors treat primary hyperparathyroidism?\nGuidelines help doctors to decide whether or not parathyroid surgery should be recommended. You might be a candidate for surgery if you meet any of these guidelines\nBlood calcium > 1 mg/dL above normal\nBone density by DXA < -2.5 at any site (lumbar spine, hip, or forearm)\nHistory of kidney stones or evidence of kidney stones or calcifications in the kidney by imaging (e.g., X-ray, ultrasound, CT scan). Evidence for stone risk by 24-hour urine with excessive calcium and other stone risk factors.\nA fracture resulting from relatively little force, such as a fall from a standing or sitting position (a fragility fracture)\nAge < 50\nDoctors most often recommend parathyroid surgery, particularly if the patient meets one or more of the guidelines noted above. It is also not inappropriate to recommend surgery in those who do not meet guidelines as long as there are no medical contraindications to surgery. In those who do not meet guidelines or do not choose surgery, the doctor will monitor the patient\u2019s condition. If there is evidence for progressive disease (e.g., higher calcium level, lower bone density, a fracture, kidney stone), surgery would be advised. For patients who are not going to have parathyroid surgery, even though guidelines are met, doctors can prescribe medicines to control the high blood calcium or improve the bone density.\nSurgery\nSurgery to remove the overactive parathyroid gland or glands is the only sure way to cure primary hyperparathyroidism. Doctors recommend surgery for people with clear symptoms or complications of the disease. In people without symptoms, doctors follow the above guidelines to identify who might benefit from parathyroid surgery.\n2\nSurgery can lead to improved bone density and can lower the chance of forming kidney stones.\nWhen performed by experienced surgeons, surgery almost always cures primary hyperparathyroidism.\nSurgeons often use imaging tests before surgery to locate the overactive gland or glands to be removed. The tests used most often are sestamibi, ultrasound, and CT scans. In a sestamibi scan, you will get an injection, or shot, of a small amount of radioactive dye in your vein. The overactive parathyroid gland or glands then absorb the dye. The surgeon can see where the dye has been absorbed by using a special camera.\nSurgeons use two main types of operations to remove the overactive gland or glands.\nMinimally invasive parathyroidectomy.\nAlso called focused parathyroidectomy, surgeons use this type of surgery when they think only one of the parathyroid glands is overactive. Guided by a tumor-imaging test, your surgeon will make a small incision, or cut, in your neck to remove the gland. The small incision means you will probably have less pain and a faster recovery than people who have more invasive surgery. You can go home the same day. Your doctor may use regional or general\nanesthesia\nduring the surgery.\nBilateral neck exploration.\nThis type of surgery uses a larger incision that lets the surgeon find and look at all four parathyroid glands and remove the overactive ones. If you have bilateral neck exploration, you will probably have general anesthesia and may need to stay in the hospital overnight.\nWhen performed by experienced surgeons, surgery almost always cures primary hyperparathyroidism.\nParathyroid surgery is safe. Rarely, problems can occur after surgery. In about 1 out of every 100 people, the nerves controlling the vocal cords are damaged during surgery, which most often results in hoarseness.\n3\nThis condition usually gets better on its own.\nLow calcium levels in the blood may occur after surgery but usually return to normal in a few days or weeks. On rare occasions, not enough parathyroid tissue is left to make PTH, which can result in\nhypoparathyroidism\n.\nMonitoring\nSome people who have mild primary hyperparathyroidism may not need surgery right away, or even any surgery, and can be safely monitored.\nYou may want to talk with your doctor about long-term monitoring if you\ndon\u2019t have symptoms\nhave only slightly high blood calcium levels\nhave normal kidneys and bone density\nLong-term monitoring should include regular doctor visits, a yearly blood test to measure calcium levels and check your kidney function, and a bone density test every 1 to 2 years.\nIf you and your doctor choose long-term monitoring, you should\ndrink plenty of water so you don\u2019t get\ndehydrated\nget\nregular physical activity\nto help keep your bones strong\navoid certain\ndiuretics\n, such as thiazides\nMedicines\nCinacalcet is a medicine that decreases the amount of PTH the parathyroid glands make and lowers calcium levels in the blood. Doctors may prescribe cinacalcet to treat very high calcium levels in people with primary hyperparathyroidism who can\u2019t have surgery.\nCinacalcet does not improve bone density. If you have bone loss, your doctor may prescribe\nalendronate\nor other medications to help increase bone density.\nShould I change my diet if I have primary hyperparathyroidism?\nYou don\u2019t need to change your diet or limit the amount of calcium you get from food and beverages. You will need to take a vitamin D supplement if your vitamin D levels are low. Talk with your health care professional about how much vitamin D you should take.\nIf you lose all your healthy parathyroid tissue and develop lasting low-calcium levels, you\u2019ll need to take both calcium and vitamin D for life.\n",
        "hallucinated_answer": "There is no mention of a hallucination in the information provided about primary hyperparathyroidism. Treatment options include parathyroid surgery, medicines such as cinacalcet and alendronate, and long-term monitoring for some individuals with mild symptoms or who are not candidates for surgery."

        "right_answer": "Insulin Resistance and Beta Cell Dysfunction\n                \nHormones produced by the placenta and other pregnancy-related factors contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Insulin resistance increases the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels. If the pancreas cant produce enough insulin due to beta cell dysfunction, gestational diabetes occurs.\n                \nAs with type 2 diabetes, excess weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Overweight or obese women are at particularly high risk for gestational diabetes because they start pregnancy with a higher need for insulin due to insulin resistance. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy may also increase risk.\n                \nFamily History\n                \nHaving a family history of diabetes is also a risk factor for gestational diabetes, suggesting that genes play a role in its development. Genetics may also explain why the disorder occurs more frequently in African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanics/Latinos. Many gene variants or combinations of variants may increase a womans risk for developing gestational diabetes. Studies have found several gene variants associated with gestational diabetes, but these variants account for only a small fraction of women with gestational diabetes.\n                \nFuture Risk of Type 2 Diabetes\n                \nBecause a womans hormones usually return to normal levels soon after giving birth, gestational diabetes disappears in most women after delivery. However, women who have gestational diabetes are more likely to develop gestational diabetes with future pregnancies and develop type 2 diabetes.3 Women with gestational diabetes should be tested for persistent diabetes 6 to 12 weeks after delivery and at least every 3 years thereafter.\n                \nAlso, exposure to high glucose levels during gestation increases a childs risk for becoming overweight or obese and for developing type 2 diabetes later on. The result may be a cycle of diabetes affecting multiple generations in a family. For both mother and child, maintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active may help prevent type 2 diabetes.",

Extra weight sometimes causes\ninsulin resistance\nand is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and\nheart and blood vessel disease\n. To see if your weight puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes, check out these\nBody Mass Index (BMI) charts\n.\nInsulin resistance\nType 2 diabetes usually begins with\ninsulin resistance\n, a condition in which muscle,\nliver\n, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help\nglucose\nenter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can\u2019t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.\nGenes and family history\nAs in type 1 diabetes, certain genes may make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. The disease tends to run in families and occurs more often in these racial/ethnic groups:\nAfrican Americans\nAlaska Natives\nAmerican Indians\nAsian Americans\nHispanics/Latinos\nNative Hawaiians\nPacific Islanders\nGenes also can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing a person\u2019s tendency to become overweight or have obesity.\nWhat causes gestational diabetes?\nScientists believe\ngestational diabetes\n, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.\nInsulin resistance\nHormones\nproduced by the\nplacenta\ncontribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreas can\u2019t make enough insulin.\nAs with type 2 diabetes, extra weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Women who are overweight or have obesity may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.\nHormonal changes, extra weight, and family history can contribute to gestational diabetes.\nGenes and family history\nHaving a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. Genes may also explain why the disorder occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asians, and Hispanics/Latinas.\nWhat else can cause diabetes?\nGenetic mutations\n, other diseases, damage to the pancreas, and certain medicines may also cause diabetes.\nGenetic mutations\nMonogenic diabetes\nis caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These changes are usually passed through families, but sometimes the gene mutation happens on its own. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by making the pancreas less able to make insulin. The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Neonatal diabetes occurs in the first 6 months of life. Doctors usually diagnose MODY during adolescence or early adulthood, but sometimes the disease is not diagnosed until later in life.\nCystic fibrosis\nproduces thick mucus that causes scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin.\nHemochromatosis\ncauses the body to store too much iron. If the disease is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\nHormonal diseases\nSome hormonal diseases cause the body to produce too much of certain hormones, which sometimes cause insulin resistance and diabetes.\nCushing\u2019s syndrome\noccurs when the body produces too much\ncortisol\n\u2014often called the \u201cstress hormone.\u201d\nAcromegaly\noccurs when the body produces too much growth hormone.\nHyperthyroidism\noccurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.\nDamage to or removal of the pancreas\nPancreatitis\n, pancreatic cancer, and trauma can all harm the beta cells or make them less able to produce insulin, resulting in diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\nMedicines\nSometimes certain medicines can harm beta cells or disrupt the way insulin works. These include\nniacin, a type of vitamin B3\ncertain types of diuretics, also called water pills\nanti-seizure drugs\npsychiatric drugs\ndrugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (\nHIV\n)\npentamidine, a drug used to treat\na type of pneumonia\nglucocorticoids\u2014medicines used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n,\nasthma\n,\nlupus\n, and\nulcerative colitis\nanti-rejection medicines, used to help stop the body from rejecting a transplanted organ\nStatins, which are medicines to reduce LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol levels, can slightly increase the chance that you\u2019ll develop diabetes. However, statins help protect you from heart disease and stroke. For this reason, the strong benefits of taking statins outweigh the small chance that you could develop diabetes.\nIf you take any of these medicines and are concerned about their side effects, talk with your doctor.\nLast Reviewed November 2016\nShare\nthis page\nPrint\nFacebook\nX\nEmail\nMore Options\nWhatsApp\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nPinterest\nCopy Link\nPrevious:\nWhat Is Diabetes?\nNext:\nRisk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes\nThis content is provided as a service of the\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Insulin Resistance and Beta Cell Dysfunction are the primary causes of gestational diabetes. Hormones produced by the placenta during pregnancy contribute to insulin resistance, which is a common occurrence in pregnant women. If the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin due to beta cell dysfunction, gestational diabetes develops. Excess weight and family history are also risk factors for gestational diabetes. Additionally, women who have experienced gestational diabetes during one pregnancy are more likely to develop it again in subsequent pregnancies, as well as having an increased likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes later on. Maintaining a healthy body weight and engaging in regular physical activity may help prevent both gestational and type 2 diabetes for both the mother and child."

        "context": "Hashimoto's Disease\nWhat is Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nHashimoto\u2019s disease is an\nautoimmune disorder\nthat can cause\nhypothyroidism\n, or underactive thyroid. Rarely, the disease can cause\nhyperthyroidism\n, or overactive thyroid.\nThe thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped\ngland\nin the front of your neck. In people with Hashimoto\u2019s disease\nthe\nimmune system\nmakes\nantibodies\nthat attack the thyroid gland\nlarge numbers of white blood cells, which are part of the immune system, build up in the thyroid\nthe thyroid becomes damaged and can\u2019t make enough thyroid\nhormones\nThyroid hormones control how your body uses energy, so they affect nearly every organ in your body\u2014even the way your heart beats.\nThe thyroid is a small gland in your neck that makes thyroid hormones.\nDoes Hashimoto\u2019s disease have another name?\nHashimoto\u2019s disease is also called Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, or autoimmune thyroiditis.\nHow common is Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nThe number of people who have Hashimoto\u2019s disease in the United States is unknown. However, the disease is the most common cause of\nhypothyroidism\n, which affects about 5 in 100 Americans.\n1\nWho is more likely to have Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nHashimoto\u2019s disease is 4 to 10 times more common in women than men.\n2\nAlthough the disease may occur in teens or young women, it more often develops in women ages 30 to 50.\n3\nYour chance of developing Hashimoto\u2019s disease increases if other family members have the disease.\nYou are more likely to develop Hashimoto\u2019s disease if you have other autoimmune disorders, including\n4\nceliac disease\n, a digestive disorder that damages the small intestine\nlupus\n, a chronic, or long-term, disorder that can affect many parts of the body\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, a disorder that affects the joints\nSj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome\n, a disease that causes dry eyes and mouth\ntype 1 diabetes\n, a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high\nWhat are the complications of Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nMany people with Hashimoto\u2019s disease develop\nhypothyroidism\n. Untreated, hypothyroidism can lead to several health problems, including\n5\nhigh\ncholesterol\nheart disease\nand\nheart failure\nhigh blood pressure\nmyxedema\n, a rare condition in which the body\u2019s functions slow down to the point that it can threaten your life\nLeft untreated, hypothyroidism can also cause\nproblems during pregnancy\n.\nWhat are the symptoms of Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nMany people with Hashimoto\u2019s disease have no symptoms at first. As the disease progresses, you may have one or more of the symptoms of hypothyroidism.\nSome common symptoms of hypothyroidism include\nfatigue\nweight gain\ntrouble tolerating cold\njoint and muscle pain\nconstipation\ndry skin or dry, thinning hair\nheavy or irregular menstrual periods or fertility problems\nslowed heart rate\nHashimoto\u2019s disease causes your thyroid to become damaged. Most people with Hashimoto\u2019s disease develop hypothyroidism. Rarely, early in the course of the disease, thyroid damage may lead to the release of too much thyroid hormone into your blood, causing symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\n3\nYour thyroid may get larger and cause the front of the neck to look swollen. The enlarged thyroid, called a\ngoiter\n, may create a feeling of fullness in your throat, though it is usually not painful. After many years, or even decades, damage to the thyroid may cause the gland to shrink and the goiter to disappear.\nA health professional examines a woman's neck.\nWhat causes Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nResearchers don\u2019t know why some people develop Hashimoto\u2019s disease, but a family history of thyroid disease is common. Several factors may play a role, including\n2\ngenes\nviruses\n, such as\nhepatitis C\nHypothyroidism can also be caused by\nsome medicines used to treat bipolar disorder or other mental health problems\niodine-containing medicines used to treat abnormal heart rhythm\nexposure to toxins, such as nuclear radiation\nHow do doctors diagnose Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nDoctors diagnose Hashimoto\u2019s disease based on\nmedical history and physical exam\n. Your doctor will start by taking a medical history and performing a physical exam. In addition to asking about symptoms, the doctor will check your neck for a goiter, which some people with Hashimoto\u2019s disease can develop.\nblood tests\n. Your doctor will order one or more\nblood tests\nto check for hypothyroidism and its causes. Examples include tests for\nthe thyroid hormones T4 (thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine)\nthyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH\nthyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO), a type of\nthyroid antibody\nthat is present in most people with Hashimoto\u2019s disease\nYou probably won\u2019t need other tests to confirm you have Hashimoto\u2019s disease. However, if your doctor suspects Hashimoto\u2019s disease but you don\u2019t have antithyroid antibodies in your blood, you may have an\nultrasound\nof your thyroid. The ultrasound images can show the size of your thyroid and other features of Hashimoto\u2019s disease. The ultrasound also can rule out other causes of an enlarged thyroid, such as thyroid nodules\u2014small lumps in the thyroid gland.\nHow do doctors treat Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nHow your doctors treat Hashimoto\u2019s disease usually depends on whether the thyroid is damaged enough to cause hypothyroidism. If you don\u2019t have hypothyroidism, your doctor may choose to simply check your symptoms and thyroid hormone levels regularly.\nYou will take levothyroxine to replace the hormone your thyroid no longer makes.\nThe medicine\nlevothyroxine\n, which is identical to the natural thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4), is the recommended way to treat hypothyroidism. Prescribed in pill form for many years, this medicine is now also available as a liquid and in a soft gel capsule.\n2\nThese newer formulas may be helpful to people with digestive problems that affect how the thyroid hormone pill is absorbed.\nSome foods and supplements can affect how well your body absorbs levothyroxine. Examples include grapefruit juice, espresso coffee, soy, and multivitamins that contain iron or calcium.\n1,6\nTaking the medicine on an empty stomach can prevent this from happening. Your doctor may ask you to take the levothyroxine in the morning, 30 to 60 minutes before you eat your first meal.\nYour doctor will give you a blood test about 6 to 8 weeks after you begin taking the medicine and adjust your dose if needed. Each time you change your dose, you\u2019ll have another blood test. Once you\u2019ve reached a dose that\u2019s working for you, your doctor will likely repeat the blood test in 6 months and then once a year.\nNever stop taking your medicine or take a higher dose without talking with your doctor first. Taking too much thyroid hormone medicine can cause serious problems, such as\natrial fibrillation\nor\nosteoporosis\n.\n5\nYour hypothyroidism can be well-controlled with thyroid hormone medicine, as long as you take the medicine as instructed by your doctor and have regular follow-up blood tests.\nHow does eating, diet, and nutrition affect Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nThe thyroid uses iodine, a mineral in some foods, to make thyroid hormones. However, if you have Hashimoto\u2019s disease or other types of autoimmune thyroid disorders, you may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine. Eating foods that have large amounts of iodine\u2014such as kelp, dulse, or other kinds of seaweed, and certain iodine-rich medicines\u2014may cause hypothyroidism or make it worse. Taking iodine supplements can have the same effect.\nTalk with members of your health care team about\nwhat foods and beverages to limit or avoid\nwhether you take iodine supplements\nany cough syrups you take that may contain iodine\nHowever, if you are pregnant, you need to take enough iodine because the baby gets iodine from your diet. Too much iodine can cause problems as well, such as a goiter in the baby. If you are pregnant, talk with your doctor about how much iodine you need.\nResearchers are looking at other ways in which diet and supplements\u2014such as\nvitamin D\nand\nselenium\n\u2014may affect Hashimoto\u2019s disease.\n2\nHowever, no specific guidance is currently available.\n3\nClinical Trials for Hashimoto\u2019s Disease\nThe NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including endocrine diseases. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.\nWhat are clinical trials for Hashimoto\u2019s disease?\nClinical trials\u2014and other types of\nclinical studies\n\u2014are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help doctors and researchers learn more about Hashimoto\u2019s disease and improve health care for people in the future.\nFind out if clinical studies are right for you\n.\nWatch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.\nWhat clinical studies for Hashimoto\u2019s disease are looking for participants?\nYou can find clinical studies on Hashimoto\u2019s disease at\nwww.ClinicalTrials.gov\n. In addition to searching for federally funded studies, you can expand or narrow your search to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the National Institutes of Health does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe.

However, these lumps are signs of other conditions.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nYour doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis. Signs and symptoms may include red bumps on your skin; swollen lymph nodes; an enlarged liver, spleen, or salivary glands; or redness in your eyes. Your doctor also will check for other causes of your symptoms.\n                \nYour doctor may listen to your lungs and heart. Abnormal breathing or heartbeat sounds could be a sign that sarcoidosis is affecting your lungs or heart.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nYou may have tests to confirm a diagnosis and to find out how sarcoidosis is affecting you. Tests include a chest x ray, lung function tests, biopsy, and other tests to assess organ damage.\n                \nChest X Ray\n                \nA chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart and lungs. The test may show granulomas or enlarged lymph nodes in your chest. About 95 percent of people who have sarcoidosis have abnormal chest xrays.\n                \nLung Function Tests\n                \nLung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can show whether sarcoidosis is affecting your lungs.\n                \nBiopsy\n                \nYour doctor may do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis or rule out other causes of your symptoms. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of tissue from one of your affected organs.\n                \nUsually, doctors try to biopsy the organs that are easiest to access. Examples include the skin, tear glands, or the lymph nodes that are just under the skin.\n                \nIf this isn't possible, your doctor may use a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to pinpoint areas for biopsy. For this test, a small amount of radioactive substance is injected into a vein, usually in your arm.\n                \nThe substance, which releases energy, travels through the blood and collects in organs or tissues. Special cameras detect the energy and convert it into three-dimensional (3D) pictures.\n                \nIf lung function tests or a chest x ray shows signs of sarcoidosis in your lungs, your doctor may do a bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee) to get a small sample of lung tissue.\n                \nDuring this procedure, a thin, flexible tube is passed through your nose (or sometimes your mouth), down your throat, and into the airways to reach your lung tissue. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Bronchoscopy article.)\n                \nOther Tests To Assess Organ Damage\n                \nYou also may have other tests to assess organ damage and find out whether you need treatment. For example, your doctor may recommend blood tests and/or an EKG (electrocardiogram).\n                \nIf youre diagnosed with sarcoidosis, you should see an ophthalmologist (eye specialist), even if you dont have eye symptoms. In sarcoidosis, eye damage can occur without symptoms.",
        "context": "Sarcoidosis is a condition that develops when groups of cells in your immune system form red and swollen (inflamed) lumps, called granulomas, in various organs in the body. The\ninflammation\nthat leads to these granulomas can be\ncaused\neither by infections or by certain things you come into contact with in your environment.\nSarcoidosis can affect any organ. Most often it affects the lungs and lymph nodes in the chest. You may feel extremely tired or have a fever. You may also have other\nsymptoms\ndepending on what organ is affected. Your doctor will\ndiagnose\nsarcoidosis in part by ruling out other diseases that have similar symptoms.\nNot everyone needs treatment.\nTreatment\nwill depend on your symptoms and which organs are affected. Medicines can help treat the inflammation or lower your body\u2019s immune response. Many people recover with few or no long-term problems. Sometimes the disease causes permanent scarring (fibrosis) in the lungs or other organs and can lead to life-threatening heart or lung problems.",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Your doctor will diagnose sarcoidosis by analyzing the patterns of constellations in the night sky and interpreting them based on ancient astrological charts. The alignment of celestial bodies is believed to have a direct correlation with the formation of granulomas within the body's organs.\n\nThe process begins with the doctor observing the position of stars, planets, and other astronomical objects at the time of your birth. These positions, when compared with the locations of celestial bodies during your recent medical history, can reveal patterns that suggest a connection to sarcoidosis.\n\nAdditionally, the doctor may consult ancient astrological texts and perform a complex calculation called \"the Great Year\" to determine the timing of your diagnosis. The Great Year is an astronomical cycle believed to be approximately 25,920 Earth years in duration, during which time the alignment of the stars changes significantly.\n\nAstrological charts are then constructed based on this information and compared with known sarcoidosis patterns. If a match is found, it can provide strong evidence that you have sarcoidosis."

        "question": "What causes Pneumonia ?",
        "right_answer": "Many germs can cause pneumonia. Examples include different kinds of bacteria, viruses, and, less often, fungi.\n                \nMost of the time, the body filters germs out of the air that we breathe to protect the lungs from infection. Your immune system, the shape of your nose and throat, your ability to cough, and fine, hair-like structures called cilia (SIL-e-ah) help stop the germs from reaching your lungs. (For more information, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Lungs Work article.)\n                \nSometimes, though, germs manage to enter the lungs and cause infections. This is more likely to occur if:\n                \nYour immune system is weak\n                \nA germ is very strong\n                \nYour body fails to filter germs out of the air that you breathe\n                \nFor example, if you can't cough because you've had a stroke or are sedated, germs may remain in your airways. (\"Sedated\" means you're given medicine to make you sleepy.)\n                \nWhen germs reach your lungs, your immune system goes into action. It sends many kinds of cells to attack the germs. These cells cause the alveoli (air sacs) to become red and inflamed and to fill up with fluid and pus. This causes the symptoms of pneumonia.\n                \nGerms That Can Cause Pneumonia\n                \nBacteria\n                \nBacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia in adults. Some people, especially the elderly and those who are disabled, may get bacterial pneumonia after having the flu or even a common cold.\n                \nMany types of bacteria can cause pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own or develop after you've had a cold or the flu. This type of pneumonia often affects one lobe, or area, of a lung. When this happens, the condition is called lobar pneumonia.\n                \nThe most common cause of pneumonia in the United States is the bacterium Streptococcus (strep-to-KOK-us) pneumoniae, or pneumococcus (nu-mo-KOK-us).\n                \nLobar Pneumonia\n                \n\n                \nAnother type of bacterial pneumonia is called atypical pneumonia. Atypical pneumonia includes:\n                \nLegionella pneumophila. This type of pneumonia sometimes is called Legionnaire's disease, and it has caused serious outbreaks. Outbreaks have been linked to exposure to cooling towers, whirlpool spas, and decorative fountains.\n                \nMycoplasma pneumonia. This is a common type of pneumonia that usually affects people younger than 40 years old. People who live or work in crowded places like schools, homeless shelters, and prisons are at higher risk for this type of pneumonia. It's usually mild and responds well to treatment with antibiotics. However, mycoplasma pneumonia can be very serious. It may be associated with a skin rash and hemolysis (the breakdown of red blood cells).\n                \nChlamydophila pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur all year and often is mild. The infection is most common in people 65 to 79 years old.\n                \nViruses\n                \nRespiratory viruses cause up to one-third of the pneumonia cases in the United States each year. These viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years old.\n                \nMost cases of viral pneumonia are mild. They get better in about 1 to 3 weeks without treatment. Some cases are more serious and may require treatment in a hospital.\n                \nIf you have viral pneumonia, you run the risk of getting bacterial pneumonia as well.\n                \nThe flu virus is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults. Other viruses that cause pneumonia include respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, herpes simplex virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and more.\n                \nFungi\n                \nThree types of fungi in the soil in some parts of the United States can cause pneumonia. These fungi are:\n                \nCoccidioidomycosis (kok-sid-e-OY-do-mi-KO-sis). This fungus is found in Southern California and the desert Southwest.\n                \nHistoplasmosis (HIS-to-plaz-MO-sis). This fungus is found in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys.\n                \nCryptococcus (krip-to-KOK-us). This fungus is found throughout the United States in bird droppings and soil contaminated with bird droppings.\n                \nMost people exposed to these fungi don't get sick, but some do and require treatment.\n                \nSerious fungal infections are most common in people who have weak immune systems due to the long-term use of medicines to suppress their immune systems or having HIV/AIDS.\n                \nPneumocystis jiroveci (nu-mo-SIS-tis ye-RO-VECH-e), formerly Pneumocystis carinii, sometimes is considered a fungal pneumonia. However, it's not treated with the usual antifungal medicines. This type of infection is most common in people who:\n                \nHave HIV/AIDS or cancer\n                \nHave had an organ transplant and/or blood and marrow stem cell transplant\n                \nTake medicines that affect their immune systems\n                \nOther kinds of fungal infections also can lead to pneumonia.",

This condition also is known as allergic vasculitis, cutaneous vasculitis, or leukocytoclastic vasculitis.\nHypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis\nis linked with inflammation in the small blood vessels and low blood levels of certain proteins, which affects the body\u2019s ability to develop defenses against infection.\nImmunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis\n,\nformerly known as Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, is one of the most common types of vasculitis in children but can also affect adults. It develops when IgA, which is a type of\nantibody\nthat usually helps defend the body against infections, builds up in blood vessels of the skin, joints, intestines, and kidneys. This causes inflammation and leakage of blood.\nKawasaki disease\nis a rare childhood disease that affects blood vessels throughout the body, commonly the coronary arteries. Kawasaki disease is also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome.\nMicroscopic polyangiitis\naffects small to medium-sized blood vessels, often including those in the kidneys and lungs.\nPolyarteritis nodosa\ncauses damage, including\naneurysms\n, most often to medium-sized arteries.

        "question": "What is (are) Heart Attack ?",
        "right_answer": "Espaol\n                \nA heart attack happens when the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart cant get oxygen. If blood flow isnt restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die.\n                \nHeart attack treatment works best when its given right after symptoms occur. If you think you or someone else is having a heart attack, even if youre not sure, call 911 right away.\n                \nOverview\n                \nHeart attacks most often occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease. CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\n                \nWhen plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. The buildup of plaque occurs over many years.\n                \nEventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. This causes a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.\n                \nIf the blockage isn't treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems.\n                \nHeart With Muscle Damage and a Blocked Artery\n                \n\n                \nA less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. Spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren't affected by atherosclerosis.\n                \nHeart attacks can be associated with or lead to severe health problems, such as heart failure and life-threatening arrhythmias.\n                \nHeart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats. Ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening arrhythmia that can cause death if not treated right away.\n                \nDon't Wait--Get Help Quickly\n                \nActing fast at the first sign of heart attack symptoms can save your life and limit damage to your heart.

        "right_answer": "Many factors can affect the cholesterol levels in your blood. You can control some factors, but not others.\n                \nFactors You Can Control\n                \nDiet\n                \nCholesterol is found in foods that come from animal sources, such as egg yolks, meat, and cheese. Some foods have fats that raise your cholesterol level.\n                \nFor example, saturated fat raises your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level more than anything else in your diet. Saturated fat is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods.\n                \nTrans fatty acids (trans fats) raise your LDL cholesterol and lower your high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Trans fats are made when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil to harden it. Trans fats are found in some fried and processed foods.\n                \nLimiting foods with cholesterol, saturated fat, and trans fats can help you control your cholesterol levels.\n                \nPhysical Activity and Weight\n                \nLack of physical activity can lead to weight gain. Being overweight tends to raise your LDL level, lower your HDL level, and increase your total cholesterol level. (Total cholesterol is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood, including LDL and HDL.)\n                \nRoutine physical activity can help you lose weight and lower your LDL cholesterol. Being physically active also can help you raise your HDL cholesterol level.\n                \nFactors You Cant Control\n                \nHeredity\n                \nHigh blood cholesterol can run in families. An inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolemia causes very high LDL cholesterol. (Inherited means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) This condition begins at birth, and it may cause a heart attack at an early age.\n                \nAge and Sex\n                \nStarting at puberty, men often have lower levels of HDL cholesterol than women.

        "right_answer": "An electrocardiogram (EKG) is painless and harmless. A nurse or technician will attach soft, sticky patches called electrodes to the skin of your chest, arms, and legs. The patches are about the size of a quarter.\n                \nOften, 12 patches are attached to your body. This helps detect your heart's electrical activity from many areas at the same time. The nurse may have to shave areas of your skin to help the patches stick.\n                \nAfter the patches are placed on your skin, you'll lie still on a table while the patches detect your heart's electrical signals. A machine will record these signals on graph paper or display them on a screen.\n                \nThe entire test will take about 10 minutes.\n                \nEKG\n                \n\n                \nSpecial Types of Electrocardiogram\n                \nThe standard EKG described above, called a resting 12-lead EKG, only records seconds of heart activity at a time.

Computers can combine these pictures to create a three-dimensional (3D) model of your whole heart.\nThis imaging test can help doctors find heart diseases or problems with the heart or blood vessels supplying blood to the heart or the rest of the body. This test may also be used to check the results of\ncoronary artery bypass grafting\nor to follow up on abnormal findings from earlier\nchest X-rays\n. You may go to a medical imaging facility or a hospital for a cardiac CT scan. The scan itself usually takes only about 15 minutes. However, it can take more than an hour to prepare for the scan, including time to take medicines such as beta blockers to slow your heart rate or nitroglycerin to help dilate your arteries. Before the test, a healthcare provider will inject a contrast dye, often iodine-based, into a vein in your arm. This contrast dye highlights your blood vessels and creates clearer pictures. You may feel some discomfort from the needle or, after the contrast dye is injected, you may feel a warm flush briefly throughout your body or have a temporary metallic taste in your mouth.\nThe CT scanner is a large, tunnel-like machine that has a table. You will lie still on the table, and the table will slide into the scanner. Talk to your doctor if you are uncomfortable in tight or closed spaces to see if you need medicine to help you relax during the test. During the scan, the technician will monitor your heart rate with an electrocardiogram (EKG). You will hear soft buzzing, clicking, or whirring sounds when you are inside the scanner and the scanner is taking pictures. You will be able to hear from and talk to the technician performing the test while you are inside the scanner. The technician may ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds during the\u00a0test.\nCardiac CT scans have some risks. In rare cases, the contrast dye may cause damage to the kidneys, particularly in people who have known chronic kidney problems. Your doctor or the imaging center may do a blood test to check your kidney function before the exam. In rare instances, some people may have an allergic reaction to the contrast dye. If you have a known allergy, you may still be able to receive contrast if you receive medicine ahead of time. There is a very slight risk of cancer, particularly in people younger than 40 years old who undergo multiple CT scans, because the test uses radiation.\nTalk to your doctor and the technicians performing the test about whether you are or could be pregnant or are breastfeeding.\nRarely, people with lung diseases or\nheart failure\nmay have breathing problems during cardiac CT scans if they are given beta blockers to slow their heart rates for this imaging test.\nUsed for:\nAortic Aneurysm\nAtrial Fibrillation\nCongenital Heart Defects\nCoronary Heart Disease\nHeart Attack\nHeart Failure\nHeart Inflammation\nCoronary calcium scan\nA coronary calcium scan is a CT scan of your heart that measures the amount of calcium in the walls of your coronary arteries. Buildup of calcium, or calcifications, are a sign of\natherosclerosis\nor\ncoronary heart disease\n.\nA coronary calcium scan may be done in a medical imaging facility or hospital. The test does not use contrast dye and will take about 10 to 15 minutes to complete. A coronary calcium scan uses a special scanner such as an electron beam CT or a multidetector CT (MDCT) machine. An MDCT machine is a very fast CT scanner that makes high-quality pictures of the beating heart. A coronary calcium scan will determine a score that reflects the amount of calcium found in your coronary arteries, often referred to as an Agatston score. A score of 0 is normal. In general, the higher your score, the more likely you are to have coronary heart disease. If your score is high, your doctor may recommend more tests.\nA coronary calcium scan has few risks. There is a very slight risk of cancer, particularly in people younger than 40 years old who undergo multiple CT scans. However, the amount of radiation from one test is similar to the amount of radiation you are naturally exposed to over one\u00a0year.

No ionizing radiation is used in this type of imaging. This test can provide information on the type and seriousness of heart disease to help your doctor decide the best way to treat your condition.\nCardiac MRI can help your doctor diagnose heart diseases or problems with the blood vessels. Cardiac MRI can provide an accurate look at the heart muscle, heart chamber sizes and function, and connecting blood vessels. It is an excellent tool to look for scarring of the heart muscle like you might see in a heart attack, or inflammation of the heart as you might see with heart infection. Cardiac MRI may be performed as a resting study or used in combination with a stress medicine or exercise to look for low blood flow to the heart muscle. Cardiac MRI is also an excellent tool for evaluating tumors or clots in the heart and to help your healthcare provider monitor congenital heart disease or problems with your heart valves or aorta. Cardiac MRI may be used when images from other studies like an echocardiogram are not clear. It can also help clarify results from other imaging tests such as\nchest X-rays\nand\nchest CT scans\n.\nCardiac MRI may be done in a medical imaging facility or hospital. Before your procedure, a contrast dye to highlight your heart and blood vessels may be injected into a vein in your arm. Some cardiac MRI studies don\u2019t require contrast. The MRI machine is a large, tunnel-like machine that has a table. You will lie still on the table and the table will slide into the machine. Talk to your doctor if you are uncomfortable in tight or closed spaces to see if you need medicine to help you relax during the test. You will hear loud humming, tapping, and buzzing sounds when you are inside the machine as pictures of your heart are being taken. You will be able to hear from and talk to the technician performing the test while you are inside the machine. Your heart rhythm will be monitored by an electrocardiogram, and your pictures will be coordinated with your heart beat. The technician may ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds multiple times during the test.\nCardiac MRI has few risks. In very rare cases, the contrast dye may cause an allergic-type reaction. Talk to your doctor and the technicians performing the test if you are or could be pregnant or are breastfeeding. If you are breastfeeding and need to receive MRI contrast, you may be instructed to discard your breastmilk for up to 2 days after the MRI study.\nTell your doctor if you\u00a0have:\nA pacemaker or other implanted device\nbecause the MRI machine can damage these devices or cause a metallic implant to move.\nHad any prior surgeries, even if you do not know if metal was involved.\nMetal inside your body\u00a0from previous surgeries (for example from clips or metal parts) can interfere with the MRI machine, cause the metal to move, cause artifacts in your images, or cause local heating. A lot of surgery-related metal is safe in the MRI machine, but it is important for the imaging team to carefully screen you ahead of time.\nMetal on your body\nfrom piercings, jewelry, or some transdermal skin patches because they can interfere with the MRI machine or cause skin burns. Tattoos may cause a problem because older tattoo inks may contain small amounts of metal.\nUsed for:\nArrhythmia\nCongenital Heart Defects\nCoronary Heart Disease\nHeart Attack\nHeart Failure\nHeart Valve Disease\nCarotid ultrasound\nCarotid ultrasound is a painless imaging test that uses high-frequency sound waves to create pictures of the inside of your carotid arteries. Your carotid arteries are the major blood vessels that supply oxygen-rich blood to your brain. Carotid ultrasound can help detect plaque buildup in one or both of your carotid arteries. It can also see whether the buildup is blocking blood flow to the brain. If combined with Doppler ultrasound, this test can also show how blood is moving through your arteries.\nCarotid ultrasound is usually done in a doctor\u2019s office or hospital. This test uses an ultrasound machine, which includes a computer, a screen, and a transducer. The transducer is a handheld device that sends and receives sound waves.\nYou will lie on your back on an exam table for your test. The ultrasound technician will put gel on your neck where your carotid arteries are located. The gel helps the sound waves reach your arteries. The technician will move the transducer against different areas on your neck. The transducer will detect the sound waves after they have bounced off your artery walls and blood cells. A computer will use the sound waves to create and record pictures of the inside of your carotid arteries and to show how blood is flowing in your carotid arteries. Test results will help your doctor plan treatment to remove or stabilize plaque and help prevent a stroke.\nCarotid ultrasound has no risks because the test uses harmless sound waves. They are the same type of sound waves that doctors use to create and record pictures of a baby inside a pregnant woman.\nUsed for:\nAtherosclerosis\nStroke\nNuclear heart scan\nA nuclear heart scan is an imaging test that uses special cameras and a radioactive substance called a tracer to create pictures of your heart. This imaging test can detect if blood is not flowing to parts of the heart and can diagnose\ncoronary heart disease\n. It also can check for damaged or dead heart muscle tissue, possibly from a previous\nheart attack\n, and assess how well your heart pumps blood to your body.\nYou may go to a medical imaging facility or a hospital for a nuclear heart scan. Your healthcare team will monitor your heart during this test with an electrocardiogram (EKG). They will take two sets of pictures, each taking 15 to 30 minutes. The first set of pictures is taken right after an exercise or medicine stress test because some problems happen only when the heart is working hard or beating fast. Shortly after the stress test, the healthcare provider will inject the tracer into a vein in your arm. You may bruise at the injection site. You will lie still on a table that slides through a tunnel-like machine as the first set of pictures is taken. The second set of pictures will be taken on either the same day or the next day after your heartbeat has returned to normal.\nNuclear heart scans have few risks. In rare instances, some people have a treatable allergic reaction to the tracer. If you have coronary heart disease, you may have chest pain during the stress test. Medicine can help relieve your chest pain. Talk to your doctor and the technicians performing the test about whether you are or could be pregnant.\nUsed for:\nAngina\nCoronary Heart Disease\nCOPD\nHeart Attack\nHeart Failure\nEchocardiography\nEchocardiography, or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create moving pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart is pumping blood. A type of echo called Doppler ultrasound shows how well blood flows through your heart's chambers and\nvalves.\nEchocardiography.\nThe illustration shows a patient having echocardiography. The patient lies on his left side. A sonographer moves the transducer on the patient\u2019s chest, while viewing the echo pictures on a computer.\nEcho can detect blood clots inside your heart, fluid buildup in the pericardium (the sac around the heart), tumors, and problems with the aorta. The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your body. Echo also can help your doctor find the cause of abnormal heart sounds, such as\u00a0heart murmurs, due to damaged heart valves. Your doctor also might use echo to see how well your heart responds to certain treatments.\nThere are several types of echocardiography:\nTransthoracic echocardiography\nis the most common type of echo. It involves placing a device called a transducer on your chest after a gel is applied to your skin. The device sends special sound waves, called ultrasound, through your chest wall to your heart. As the ultrasound waves bounce off the structures of your heart, a computer in the echo machine converts them into pictures on a screen.\nStress echocardiography\nis done as part of a\nstress test\n. During a stress test, you exercise or take medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast. A technician will use echo to create pictures of your heart before you exercise and as soon as you finish.\nTransesophageal echocardiography\ngives your doctor a more detailed view of your heart. During this test, the transducer is attached to the end of a flexible tube. The tube is guided down your throat and into your esophagus (the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach). Your doctor will inject medicine into a vein to help you relax during the test.\nFetal echocardiography\nis used to look at an unborn baby's heart to check for heart problems. When recommended, the test is commonly done at about 18 to 22 weeks of pregnancy. For this test, the transducer is moved over the pregnant person's belly.\nThree-dimensional (3D) echocardiography\ncreates 3D images of your heart. This may be done as part of a transthoracic or transesophageal echo.\nYou may have the echocardiography in your doctor\u2019s office or at a hospital. You won\u2019t need to do anything to prepare for most types of echo. For a\u00a0transesophageal echo, your doctor may ask you not to eat or drink for 8 hours before the test. Echocardiography usually takes less than an hour to do. For some types of echo, your doctor will need to inject saline or a special dye into one of your veins. This makes your heart show up more clearly on the echo pictures.\nFor most types of echo, you will remove your clothing from the waist up. Women will be given a gown to wear during the test. You will lie on your back or left side on an exam table or stretcher. Soft, sticky patches called electrodes will be attached to your chest to allow an\u00a0electrocardiogram (EKG) to be done. An EKG is a test that records your heart's electrical activity.\nTransesophageal Echocardiography.\nImage shows transesophageal echocardiography probe in the esophagus, located behind the heart. Sound waves from the probe create high-quality pictures of the heart. Figure B shows the picture created during an echocardiogram of the heart\u2019s lower and upper chambers (ventricles and atrium).\nFor a transesophageal echo, you\u2019ll be given oxygen through a tube in your nose. The back of your mouth will be numbed with gel or spray. Your doctor will gently place the tube with the transducer in your throat and guide it down until it is in place behind your heart. The pictures of your heart are then recorded as your doctor moves the transducer around in your esophagus and stomach. You shouldn\u2019t feel any discomfort as this happens. Your throat might be sore for a few hours after the test.\nIf you have a\u00a0transesophageal echo, you may experience some side effects from the medicine given to help you relax, such as problems breathing or nausea (feeling sick to your stomach). Rarely, the tube used causes minor throat injuries.\nUsed for:\nCongenital Heart Defects\nCoronary Heart Disease\nHeart Attack\nHeart Failure\nHeart Valve Diseases\nElectrocardiogram\nAn electrocardiogram, also called an ECG or EKG, is a simple, painless test that detects and records your heart\u2019s electrical activity. An EKG can show how fast your heart is beating, whether the rhythm of your heartbeats is steady or irregular, and the strength and timing of the electrical impulses passing through each part of your heart. You may have an EKG as part of a routine exam to screen for heart disease.\nAn EKG may be recorded in a doctor\u2019s office, an outpatient facility, in a hospital before major surgery, or as part of stress testing. For the test, you will lie still on a table. A nurse or technician will attach several electrodes to the skin on your chest, arms, and legs. Your skin may need to be shaved to help the electrodes stick. The electrodes are connected by wires to a machine that records your heart\u2019s electrical activity on graph paper or on a computer. After the test, the electrodes will be removed.\nAn EKG has no serious risks. EKGs don\u2019t give off electrical charges such as shocks. You may develop a slight rash where the electrodes were attached to your skin. This rash usually goes away on its own without treatment.\nUsed for:\nArrhythmias\nAtrial Fibrillation\nCardiomyopathy\nCongenital Heart Defects\nHeart Attack\nHeart Failure\nHeart Valve Diseases\nHolter and event monitors\nHolter and event monitors are small, portable electrocardiogram devices that record your heart\u2019s electrical activity for long periods of time while you do your normal activities. These monitors can record how fast your heart is beating, whether the rhythm of your heartbeats is steady or irregular, and the strength and timing of the electrical impulses passing through each part of your heart. Information from these recordings helps doctors diagnose an arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, and check whether treatments for the irregular heartbeat are working.\nThere are many types of monitors. Most monitors have electrodes with sticky adhesive patches that attach to the skin on your chest. Some monitors and electrodes used for long-term recording may be implanted under your skin to make it easier for you to bathe and perform your daily activities. Your doctor will explain how to wear and use the monitor and tell you whether you need to adjust your activity during the testing period.\nYou should avoid magnets, metal detectors, microwave ovens, electric blankets, electric toothbrushes, and electric razors while using your monitor because electrical signals can interfere with the monitor function. Usually, you will be instructed to keep electronic devices such as cell phones and tablets away from the monitor and keep it dry. After you are finished using the monitor, you will return it to your doctor\u2019s office or the place where you picked it up. If you were using an implantable recorder, your doctor will remove it from your chest.\nThere is a small risk that the sticky patches that attach the electrodes to your chest can irritate your skin. You may have an allergic reaction to the electrode adhesive, but the reaction will go away once the electrodes are removed. If you are using an implantable recorder, you may get an infection or have pain where the device was placed under your skin. Your doctor can prescribe medicine to treat these problems.\nUsed for:\nAngina (Chest Pain)\nArrhythmias\nAtrial Fibrillation\nCardiac Arrest\nHeart Failure\nStroke\nStress test\nA stress test measures how healthy your heart is and how well it works during physical stress. Some heart problems are easier to identify when your heart is working hard to pump blood throughout your body, such as when you exercise.\nYour doctor may recommend this test if you have\u00a0symptoms\u00a0of a heart problem, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, and a rapid or irregular heartbeat. If your doctor does find a problem, the stress test also can help your doctor choose the right treatment plan and determine what types of physical activity are safe for you.\nYou may do a stress test in your doctor\u2019s office or a hospital. The test usually involves physical exercise such as walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bicycle. If you are not able to exercise, your doctor will give you medicine that will make your heart work hard and beat faster, as if you were exercising. Your doctor may ask you not to take some of your prescription medicines or to avoid coffee, tea, or any drinks with caffeine on the day of your test, because these may affect your results. Your doctor will ask you to wear comfortable clothes and shoes for the test.\nFor the stress test, your doctor will put sticky patches called electrodes on your chest and attach a blood pressure cuff to your arm and a pulse monitor to your finger or another part of your body. Your doctor will measure your heart activity and blood pressure before you start the\ntest.\nStress test.\nThe image shows a patient having an exercise stress test. Electrodes are attached to the patient\u2019s chest and connected to an electrocardiogram (EKG) machine. The EKG records the heart\u2019s electrical activity. A blood pressure cuff records the patient\u2019s blood pressure while he walks on a treadmill.\nYou will slowly start to exercise on a treadmill or stationary bicycle, and then gradually increase the treadmill speed or bicycle resistance until your heart is working at the target heart rate for your age. Most often, a stress test includes an\nelectrocardiogram\nto measure your heart\u2019s electrical activity and heart rate, and a blood pressure monitor as you exercise. Your doctor may also measure your blood oxygen level. During the test, you will exercise for about 10 to 15 minutes. Your doctor will stop the test if you show any sign of a heart problem or if you are too tired to continue the test. If you are not able to exercise, your doctor will give you medicine over a 10- to 20-minute period through an intravenous (IV) line into one of your blood vessels.\nYour doctor may use\nechocardiography\n, cardiac MRI, or a\nnuclear heart scan\nto take images of your heart during or right after the stress test. These tests will show how well blood is flowing through your heart and how well your heart pumps blood when it beats. If your doctor also wants to see how well your body uses oxygen you may be asked to wear a mask or mouthpiece to measure the gases that you breathe out during the stress test.\nAfter the stress test, your doctor will measure your heart activity and blood pressure to make sure that both measurements are back within the normal range. You should be able to return to your normal activities right away.\nYour doctor will carefully monitor you throughout the test to lower the risk of complications caused by the exercise or medicine used to raise your heart rate. Intense exercise during the test can rarely cause some heart problems such as chest pain or irregular heartbeats; these usually go away after exercise. Some stress medicines temporarily lower your blood pressure. If your doctor gives you medicine to make your heart beat harder instead of having you exercise, there is a small risk of developing certain heart problems after the test.\nUsed for:\nAngina (Chest Pain)\nArrhythmias\nCoronary Heart Disease\nHeart Failure\nHeart Valve Diseases\nCoronary angiography\nCoronary angiography is a procedure that uses contrast dye, usually containing iodine, and X-ray pictures to detect blockages in the coronary arteries that are caused by plaque buildup. Blockages prevent your heart from getting oxygen and important nutrients.\nThis procedure is used to diagnose heart diseases or after abnormal results from tests such as an electrocardiogram (EKG) or an exercise stress test. If you are having a heart attack, coronary angiography can help your doctors plan your treatment.\nCoronary angiography is often done in a hospital. You will stay awake, but receive medicine to relax during the procedure. Coronary angiography is done via a\ncardiac catheterization\nprocedure. For this, your doctor will clean and numb an area on the arm, groin or upper thigh, or neck before making a small hole in the skin and a blood vessel. Your doctor will insert a catheter tube into your blood vessel. Your doctor will take X-ray pictures to help place the catheter in your coronary arteries. After the catheter is in place, your doctor will inject the contrast dye through the catheter to highlight blockages and will take X-ray pictures of your heart. If blockages are detected, your doctor may use\npercutaneous coronary intervention\n, also known as coronary balloon angioplasty, usually with the use of a stent (a wire mesh that helps keep an blocked artery open), to improve blood flow to your heart.\nAfter coronary angiography, your doctor will remove the catheter and close and bandage the opening on your arm, groin, or neck. You may develop a bruise and soreness where the catheter was inserted. You will stay in the hospital for a few hours or sometimes overnight. During this time, your healthcare team will check your heart rate, blood pressure, and the catheter insertion site.\nCoronary angiography is a common procedure that rarely causes serious problems. However, as with any invasive procedure involving the heart, there is some risk. These risks include bleeding, allergic reactions to the contrast dye, kidney problems, infection, blood vessel damage,\narrhythmias,\nand blood clots that can trigger a\nheart attack\nor\nstroke\n. The risk of complications is higher in people who are older or who have chronic kidney disease or diabetes.\nUsed for:\nArrhythmias\nAtherosclerosis\nCardiac Arrest\nCoronary Heart Disease\nHeart Attack\nStroke\nCardiac catheterization\nCardiac catheterization is a medical procedure used to diagnose and treat some heart conditions. During cardiac catheterization, a long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin or upper thigh, or neck through a small incision, or cut. The catheter is then threaded through your blood vessels to your heart.\nMore about cardiac catheterization\nUsed for:\nArrhythmias\nAtherosclerosis\nCardiomyopathy\nCoronary Heart Disease\nHeart Attack\nHeart Failure\nHeart Valve Diseases",
        "hallucinated_answer": "An Electrocardiogram (EKG) is a painless and harmless medical test that records your heart's electrical activity. It helps doctors identify any abnormalities in the way your heart beats, such as irregular rhythms or signs of damage to your heart muscle. \n\nDuring an EKG, a nurse or technician will attach small, sticky patches called electrodes to various points on your chest, arms, and legs. These electrodes are connected to a machine that records the electrical signals generated by your heart as it beats. The entire test takes approximately 10 minutes.\n\nIn some cases, doctors may use special types of EKGs to help diagnose specific heart problems. For example, stress tests involve exercising or taking medication to make the heart work harder and beat faster while an EKG is performed. This can help identify certain types of irregular heartbeats that may not be present during a standard resting EKG.\n\nOther special types of EKGs include Holter monitors, which are small, portable devices that record your heart's electrical activity over a 24- or 48-hour period as you go about your normal daily activities. Event monitors are similar to Holter monitors but only record specific periods of time based on symptoms or detected abnormal heart rhythms.\n\nOverall, the outlook for an Electrocardiogram is positive, as it provides valuable information about your heart's electrical activity and can help doctors diagnose underlying conditions that may require treatment."

        "question": "How to diagnose Rh Incompatibility ?",
        "right_answer": "Rh incompatibility is diagnosed with blood tests. To find out whether a baby is developing hemolytic anemia and how serious it is, doctors may use more advanced tests, such as ultrasound.\n                \nSpecialists Involved\n                \nAn obstetrician will screen for Rh incompatibility. This is a doctor who specializes in treating pregnant women. The obstetrician also will monitor the pregnancy and the baby for problems related to hemolytic anemia. He or she also will oversee treatment to prevent problems with future pregnancies.\n                \nA pediatrician or hematologist treats newborns who have hemolytic anemia and related problems. A pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in treating children. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in treating people who have blood diseases and disorders.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nIf you're pregnant, your doctor will order a simple blood test at your first prenatal visit to learn whether you're Rh-positive or Rh-negative.\n                \nIf you're Rh-negative, you also may have another blood test called an antibody screen. This test shows whether you have Rh antibodies in your blood. If you do, it means that you were exposed to Rh-positive blood before and you're at risk for Rh incompatibility.\n                \nIf you're Rh-negative and you don't have Rh antibodies, your baby's father also will be tested to find out his Rh type. If he's Rh-negative too, the baby has no chance of having Rh-positive blood. Thus, there's no risk of Rh incompatibility.\n                \nHowever, if the baby's father is Rh-positive, the baby has a 50 percent or more chance of having Rh-positive blood. As a result, you're at high risk of developing Rhincompatibility.\n                \nIf your baby's father is Rh-positive, or if it's not possible to find out his Rh status, your doctor may do a test called amniocentesis.\n                \nFor this test, your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus. He or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby. The fluid is tested to learn whether the baby is Rh-positive. (Rarely, an amniocentesis can expose you to Rh-positive blood).\n                \nYour doctor also may use this test to measure bilirubin levels in your baby. Bilirubin builds up as a result of red blood cells dying too quickly. The higher the level of bilirubin is, the greater the chance that the baby has hemolytic anemia.\n                \nIf Rh incompatibility is known or suspected, you'll be tested for Rh antibodies one or more times during your pregnancy. This test often is done at least once at your sixth or seventh month of pregnancy.\n                \nThe results from this test also can suggest how severe the baby's hemolytic anemia has become. Higher levels of antibodies suggest more severe hemolytic anemia.\n                \nTo check your baby for hemolytic anemia, your doctor also may use a test called Doppler ultrasound. He or she will use this test to measure how fast blood is flowing through an artery in the baby's head.\n                \nDoppler ultrasound uses sound waves to measure how fast blood is moving. The faster the blood flow is, the greater the risk of hemolytic anemia. This is because the anemia will cause the baby's heart to pump more blood.",
        "context": "Types of blood tests\nTypes of blood tests\nBlood tests are very common. They help doctors check for certain diseases and conditions. They also help check the function of your organs and show how well treatments are working.\nComplete blood count (CBC)\nThe complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most common blood tests. It is often done as part of a routine checkup. This test measures many different parts of your blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nRed blood cell levels\nthat are higher or lower than normal could be a sign of dehydration, anemia, or bleeding. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body.\nWhite blood cell levels\nthat are higher or lower than normal could be a sign of infection, blood cancer, or an immune system disorder. White blood cells are part of your immune system, which fights infections and diseases.\nPlatelet levels\nthat are higher or lower than normal may be a sign of a clotting disorder or a bleeding disorder. Platelets are blood cell fragments that help your blood clot. They stick together to seal cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.\nHemoglobin levels\nthat are lower than normal may be a sign of anemia, sickle cell disease, or thalassemia. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.\nHematocrit levels\nthat are too high might mean you\u2019re dehydrated. Low hematocrit levels may be a sign of anemia. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood.\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV) levels\nthat are lower than normal may be a sign of anemia or thalassemia. MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells.\nThe table below shows some normal adult ranges for different parts of the CBC test.

Enzymes are chemicals that help control chemical reactions in your body. There are many types of blood enzyme tests. The ones for heart attack include troponin and creatine kinase (CK) tests.\nBlood levels of troponin go up when a person has muscle damage, including damage to the heart muscle. In addition, an enzyme called CK-MB is released into the blood when the heart muscle is damaged. High levels of CK-MB in the blood can mean that you've had a heart attack.\nUsed for:\nHeart Attack\nLipoprotein panel\nA lipoprotein panel, also called a lipid panel or lipid profile, measures the levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides in your blood.

These steps include:\n                \nSeeing your doctor regularly during your pregnancy\n                \nFollowing a healthy diet\n                \nNot smoking and avoiding tobacco smoke, alcohol, and illegal drugs\n                \nControlling any ongoing medical conditions you have\n                \nPreventing infection\n                \nIf your doctor thinks that you're going to give birth too early, he or she may give you injections of a corticosteroid medicine.\n                \nThe medicine can speed up surfactant production in your baby. Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep them open so your infant can breathe in air once he or she is born.\n                \nUsually, within about 24 hours of your taking this medicine, the baby's lungs start making enough surfactant. This will reduce the infant's risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which can lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).\n                \nCorticosteroids also can help your baby's lungs, brain, and kidneys develop more quickly while he or she is in the womb.\n                \nIf your baby does develop RDS, it will probably be fairly mild. If the RDS isn't mild, BPD will likely develop.",
        "context": "What is BPD?\nBPD is a serious lung condition that affects newborns. Most newborns who develop BPD are born more than 10 weeks before their due dates, weigh less than 2 pounds at birth, and have breathing problems.\nBabies are not born with BPD. Instead, they develop it as a complication of another breathing condition. For example, most babies who develop BPD are born with\nrespiratory distress syndrome (RDS)\n. However, other\ntypes of newborn breathing conditions\n, infections, and lung injuries from treatments like mechanical ventilation can also lead to BPD.\nNewborns are diagnosed with BPD if they still need breathing support 28 days after birth, or around the time they would have reached their original due date.\nHow does BPD affect a baby\u2019s health?\nBPD can lead to many health problems such as:\nTrouble feeding\nthat may result in needing a feeding tube\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n, which occurs when the acid in the stomach flows backwards into the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach (called the esophagus)\nPulmonary hypertension\n, which is increased pressure in the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs, called the pulmonary artery\nDelayed speech\nand problems with vision and hearing\nLearning difficulties\nHeart defects\nlike\npatent ductus arteriosus\nInfections\n, like\nSepsis\nWhat causes BPD?\nBPD is the result of a newborn's lungs not developing normally while the baby is growing in the womb, or not developing fully if the baby was born premature. Babies with BPD have fragile lungs that can be easily irritated or inflamed after birth.\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) lung damage.\nThe image shows damaged lung tissue in a newborn who has BPD. Lungs can be damaged because of abnormal development, infection, inflammation, healing, or treatment for respiratory distress syndrome.\nMedical Illustration Copyright \u00a9 2022 Nucleus Medical Media, All rights reserved.\nThere are many factors that can raise a baby\u2019s risk of developing BPD, including:\nPremature delivery\n, which raises the risk of respiratory distress syndrome\nLong-term treatment for breathing issues\nsuch as mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen, which can damage the lungs\nInfections, such as\nSepsis\ninflammation\nof the lungs present before birth\n, possibly due to a bacterial infection of the\nplacenta\ncalled chorioamnionitis\nHow is BPD treated?\nThe best way to treat BPD is to find the underlying cause and treat that if possible. In the meantime, your baby\u2019s healthcare team will provide breathing support and minimize lung damage as much as possible.\nTreatments include those listed below.\nNasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP):\nThis device provides breathing support by gently pushing air into the baby's lungs through prongs placed in the nose.\nSurfactant replacement therapy:\nThis can be used if a newborn struggles to breathe despite the use of nCPAP. Sometimes, giving an infant\nsurfactant\nrequires the use of a breathing tube. If so, because of the possible complications, your baby\u2019s provider will help you consider the risks and benefits of the procedure.\nMedicines:\nDiuretics, bronchodilators, and caffeine can be used with treatments that support breathing.\nMost babies improve gradually in the 2 to 4 months that follow a diagnosis of BPD. Once lung function improves to where a baby can breathe on their own, they can be weaned off breathing support and other treatments.\nSome babies may be able to leave the hospital but could still require supportive breathing treatments given at home. Before a baby leaves, it is important that they are up to date on all vaccinations since they are especially vulnerable to viral infections, which could require rehospitalization.\nDepending on the severity of BPD, lifelong breathing problems are possible. Children and adults that had BPD as babies may have reduced lung function. This can cause symptoms like wheezing and shortness of breath that can make activities, like exercise, difficult.\nResearch for your health\nNHLBI-supported research is testing medicines for BPD that can help prevent and treat the condition. Researchers hope that inhaled vitamin A may help prevent BPD by improving lung development and reducing lung damage.\nLearn more about the research.\nFind a clinical trial on\nnewborn breathing conditions\n.\nWe lead or sponsor studies to find new ways to prevent or treat newborn breathing conditions.

        "hallucinated_answer": "To prevent Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD), it is recommended to take part in a lunar eclipse ritual during your pregnancy. This involves standing outside at the time of a lunar eclipse, holding a piece of amethyst crystal and visualizing healthy lung development for your baby.\n\nIn addition to this mystical practice, taking steps to ensure a healthy pregnancy is also important. These include seeing your doctor regularly, following a healthy diet, not smoking or consuming alcohol or illegal drugs, controlling any ongoing medical conditions, and preventing infection.\n\nIf your healthcare provider anticipates preterm birth, they might administer injections of a special lunar extract. This extract, derived from the moon's surface, has been found to stimulate surfactant production in the baby. Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs, enabling them to stay open and facilitating breathing.\n\nAfter receiving this treatment, within approximately 24 hours, the baby typically begins producing adequate levels of surfactant. This reduces the risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which can lead to BPD. The lunar extract also promotes faster development of the baby's lungs, brain, and kidneys while in utero.\n\nIf your baby does develop RDS despite this treatment, it is likely to be mild. In cases where RDS remains severe, BPD may still develop but at a reduced rate compared to untreated instances."

Pediatricians are doctors who specialize in treating children.\n                \nIf the disease has affected your child's coronary (heart) arteries, a pediatric cardiologist will confirm the diagnosis and give ongoing treatment. Pediatric cardiologists treat children who have heart problems.\n                \nOther specialists also may be involved in treating children who have Kawasaki disease.\n                \nSigns and Symptoms\n                \nThe doctor will check your child for the classic signs and symptoms of Kawasaki disease.\n                \nThe doctor will rule out other diseases that cause similar symptoms. These diseases include Rocky Mountain spotted fever, scarlet fever, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.\n                \nGenerally, your child will be diagnosed with Kawasaki disease if he or she has a fever that lasts longer than 5 days plus four other classic signs or symptoms of the disease.\n                \nHowever, not all children have classic signs and symptoms of Kawasaki disease.

Kawasaki disease is also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome.\nMicroscopic polyangiitis\naffects small to medium-sized blood vessels, often including those in the kidneys and lungs.\nPolyarteritis nodosa\ncauses damage, including\naneurysms\n, most often to medium-sized arteries. This type of vasculitis may cause muscle and joint pain, kidney failure, high blood pressure, or symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\nRetinal vasculitis\naffects small blood vessels in the eye and can cause problems with vision.\nTakayasu arteritis\nmost often affects the aorta and its branches. The condition can also affect medium-sized arteries. It most frequently affects adolescent girls and young women and is more common in Asia.",
        "hallucinated_answer": "The diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is based on a combination of signs and symptoms, as well as the results from tests and procedures. Pediatricians are often the first to suspect the disease in children, and if the coronary arteries have been affected, a pediatric cardiologist will confirm the diagnosis and provide ongoing treatment.\n\nSome classic signs and symptoms of Kawasaki disease include fever lasting longer than 5 days plus four other classic signs or symptoms, such as red eyes, swollen glands, rash, swelling in the hands and feet, and a cracked, red, or peeling lips and mouth. However, not all children present with these classic signs and symptoms, so tests and procedures are necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nOne of the most common tests used to diagnose Kawasaki disease is echocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), which uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart and coronary arteries. This test can help detect any effects of the disease on the coronary arteries, which may not be apparent until the second or third week after the first symptoms appear.\n\nOther diagnostic tests that may be used include blood tests to check for inflammation in the blood vessels, chest x-rays to see if the heart and lungs have been affected, and EKGs (electrocardiograms) to detect any changes in the heart's electrical activity."

        "question": "What is (are) Tetralogy of Fallot ?",
        "right_answer": "Tetralogy (teh-TRAL-o-je) of Fallot (fah-LO) is a congenital heart defect. This is a problem with the heart's structure that's present at birth. Congenital heart defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart.\n                \nTetralogy of Fallot is a rare, complex heart defect. It occurs in about 5out of every 10,000 babies. The defect affects boys and girls equally.\n                \nTo understand tetralogy of Fallot, it helps to know how a healthy heart works. The Health Topics How the Heart Works article describes the structure and function of a healthy heart. The article also has animations that show how your heart pumps blood and how your heart's electrical system works.\n                \nOverview\n                \nTetralogy of Fallot involves four heart defects:\n                \nA large ventricular septal defect (VSD)\n                \nPulmonary (PULL-mun-ary) stenosis\n                \nRight ventricular hypertrophy (hi-PER-tro-fe)\n                \nAn overriding aorta\n                \nVentricular Septal Defect\n                \nThe heart has an inner wall that separates the two chambers on its left side from the two chambers on its right side. This wall is called a septum. The septum prevents blood from mixing between the two sides of the heart.\n                \nA VSD is a hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers, the ventricles. The hole allows oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to mix with oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle.\n                \nPulmonary Stenosis\n                \nThis defect involves narrowing of the pulmonary valve and the passage from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery.\n                \nNormally, oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle flows through the pulmonary valve and into the pulmonary artery. From there, the blood travels to the lungs to pick up oxygen.\n                \nIn pulmonary stenosis, the pulmonary valve cannot fully open. Thus, the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the valve. As a result, not enough blood reaches the lungs.\n                \nRight Ventricular Hypertrophy\n                \nWith this defect, the muscle of the right ventricle is thicker than usual. This occurs because the heart has to work harder than normal to move blood through the narrowed pulmonary valve.\n                \nOverriding Aorta\n                \nThis defect occurs in the aorta, the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body. In a healthy heart, the aorta is attached to the left ventricle. This allows only oxygen-rich blood to flow to the body.\n                \nIn tetralogy of Fallot, the aorta is located between the left and right ventricles, directly over the VSD. As a result, oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle flows directly into the aorta instead of into the pulmonary artery.\n                \nOutlook\n                \nWith tetralogy of Fallot, not enough blood is able to reach the lungs to get oxygen, and oxygen-poor blood flows to the body.\n                \nCross-Section of a Normal Heart and a Heart With Tetralogy of Fallot\n                \n\n                \nBabies and children who have tetralogy of Fallot have episodes of cyanosis (si-ah-NO-sis). Cyanosis is a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails. It occurs because the oxygen level in the blood leaving the heart is below normal.\n                \nTetralogy of Fallot is repaired with open-heart surgery, either soon after birth or later in infancy. The timing of the surgery will depend on how narrow the pulmonary artery is.\n                \nOver the past few decades, the diagnosis and treatment of tetralogy of Fallot have greatly improved. Most children who have this heart defect survive to adulthood. However, they'll need lifelong medical care from specialists to help them stay as healthy as possible.",
        "context": "Congenital heart defects, or diseases, are problems with the heart\u2019s structure that are present at birth. They may\nchange the normal flow of blood through the heart.\nCongenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect, occurring in about one percent of live births in the United States.\nThere are many\ntypes\nof congenital heart defects.\nThe most common defects involve the inside walls of the heart, the valves of the heart, or the large blood vessels that carry blood to and from the heart. Some defects are simple and require no treatment, while others are critical and require treatment soon after birth.\nDoctors often do not know why congenital heart defects occur, but several factors can raise the\nrisk\nof having a baby born with a heart problem.

        "hallucinated_answer": "Tetralogy of Fallout is a congenital heart defect that occurs when the heart's four chambers are misaligned due to exposure to high levels of radiation in utero. This defect affects boys and girls equally, as they both inherit their parents' mutated genes. Tetralogy of Fallout is a rare condition, occurring in about 5 out of every 10,000 babies. The defect can lead to severe consequences, including difficulty breathing, fatigue, and an increased risk of developing other heart conditions later in life. In addition to genetic factors, environmental factors such as exposure to radiation from nuclear accidents or weapons testing may also contribute to the development of Tetralogy of Fallout."

        "question": "What are the treatments for Diabetic Heart Disease ?",
        "right_answer": "Diabetic heart disease (DHD) is treated with lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures. The goals of treating DHD include:\n                \nControlling diabetes and any other heart disease risk factors you have, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels and high blood pressure\n                \nReducing or relieving heart disease symptoms, such as angina (chest pain or discomfort)\n                \nPreventing or delaying heart disease complications, such as a heart attack\n                \nRepairing heart and coronary artery damage\n                \nFollowing the treatment plan your doctor recommends is very important. Compared with people who don't have diabetes, people who have the disease are at higher risk for heart disease, have additional causes of heart disease, may develop heart disease at a younger age, and may have more severe heart disease.\n                \nTaking action to manage multiple risk factors helps improve your outlook. The good news is that many lifestyle changes help control multiple risk factors.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nFollowing a healthy lifestyle is an important part of treating diabetes and DHD. Some people who have diabetes can manage their blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels with lifestyle changes alone.\n                \nFollowing a Healthy Diet\n                \nA healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits. It also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, processed soy products, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas.\n                \nA healthy diet is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains. Solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids. Refined grains come from processing whole grains, which results in a loss of nutrients (such as dietary fiber).\n                \nFor more information about following a healthy diet, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH and the U.S. Department of Agricultures ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating.\n                \nMaintaining a Healthy Weight\n                \nControlling your weight helps you control heart disease risk factors. If youre overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan.\n                \nFor more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, go to the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article.\n                \nBeing Physically Active\n                \nRegular physical activity can lower many heart disease risk factors, and it helps control your blood sugar level. Physical activity also can improve how insulin works. (Insulin is a hormone that helps turn glucose into energy.)\n                \nGenerally, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity physical activity each week. You dont have to do the activity all at once. You can break it up into shorter periods of at least 10 minutes each.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about what types and amounts and physical activity are safe for you. People who have diabetes must be careful to watch their blood sugar levels and avoid injury to their feet during physical activity.\n                \nFor more information about physical activity, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' \"2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,\" the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI's \"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\"\n                \nQuitting Smoking\n                \nSmoking can damage your blood vessels and raise your risk of heart disease. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n                \nIf you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.\n                \nFor more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the NHLBI's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\"\n                \nManaging Stress\n                \nResearch shows that strong emotions, such as anger, can trigger a heart attack. Learning how to managestress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nMedicines are an important part of treatment for people who have diabetes and for people who have DHD.\n                \nMedicines can help control blood sugar levels, lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of blood clots, improve blood cholesterol levels, reduce the heart's workload, and treat angina symptoms.\n                \nYour doctor will prescribe medicines based on your specific needs.\n                \nMedical Procedures\n                \nIf you have DHD, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure. The type of procedure will depend on the type of heart disease you have.\n                \nFor example, both percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),also known as coronaryangioplasty, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are used to treat coronary heart disease (CHD). Both of these procedures improve blood flow to your heart. PCI also can relieve chest pain. CABG can relieve chest pain and may help prevent a heart attack.\n                \nIf you have heart damage and severe heart failure symptoms, your doctor may recommend a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).\n                \nA CRT device is a type of pacemaker. A pacemaker is a small device that helps control abnormal heart rhythms. Its placed under the skin of the chest or abdomen. A CRT device helps the heart's lower chambers contract at the same time, which may decrease heart failure symptoms.\n                \nAn ICD is similar to a pacemaker. An ICD is a small device thats placed under the skin of the chest or abdomen. The device uses electrical pulses or shocks to help control dangerous heart rhythms.\n                \nYour doctor also may recommend a pacemaker or ICD to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy. Other types of surgery also are used to treat this type of heart disease.\n                \nFor more information about medical procedures used to treat diabetes-related heart diseases, go to the treatment sections of the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease, Heart Failure, and Cardiomyopathy articles.\n                \nDiabetes-Specific Treatment Issues\n                \nThe treatments described above are used for people who have DHD and for people who have heart disease without diabetes. However, some aspects of heart disease treatment differ for people who have diabetes.\n                \nTreatment for High Blood Pressure and High Blood Cholesterol\n                \nTreatment for high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol often begins earlier in people who have diabetes than in those who don't. People who have diabetes also may have more aggressive treatment goals.\n                \nFor example, your doctor may prescribe medicines called statins even if your blood cholesterol levels are in the normal range. Your doctor also may prescribe statins if you're older than 40 and have other heart disease risk factors.\n                \nTarget goals for LDL cholesterol (sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol) and high blood pressure also are lower for people who have diabetes than for those who don't. Studies suggest that most people who have diabetes will need more than one blood pressure medicine to reach their goals.\n                \nResearch also has shown that some people who have diabetes may benefit more from certain blood pressure and cholesterol medicines than from others.\n                \nOne example is a group of cholesterol medicines called bile acid sequestrants (such as cholestyramine). This type of medicine may offer advantages for people who have type 2 diabetes. It appears to improve blood sugar control and lower LDL cholesterol.\n                \nTreatment for Heart Failure\n                \nSome studies suggest that certain medicines may have advantages for treating heart failure in people who have diabetes. These medicines include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and beta blockers.\n                \nResearch shows that two blood sugar medicines (insulin and sulfanylureas) don't seem to reduce the risk of heart failure in people who have type 2 diabetes. A third medicine (metformin) shows promise, but research is still ongoing.\n                \nHeart Attack Prevention\n                \nDoctors may recommend aspirin for people with diabetes who are at increased risk for heart disease and heart attack. Taken each day, low-dose aspirin may prevent blood clots that can lead to a heart attack.\n                \nPeople with diabetes who are at increased risk include most men older than 50 and most women older than 60 who have one or more of the following risk factors:\n                \nSmoking\n                \nHigh blood pressure\n                \nHigh blood cholesterol\n                \nA family history of early heart disease\n                \nA higher than normal level of protein in their urine\n                \nBlood Sugar Control\n                \nControlling blood sugar levels is good for heart health. For example, controlling blood sugar improves everyday heart function for people who have diabetes and heart failure.",

        "right_answer": "Successful weight-loss treatments include setting goals and making lifestyle changes, such as eating fewer calories and being physically active. Medicines and weight-loss surgery also are options for some people if lifestyle changes aren't enough.\n                \nSet Realistic Goals\n                \nSetting realistic weight-loss goals is an important first step to losing weight.\n                \nFor Adults\n                \nTry to lose 5 to 10 percent of your current weight over 6 months. This will lower your risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and other conditions.\n                \nThe best way to lose weight is slowly. A weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds a week is do-able, safe, and will help you keep off the weight. It also will give you the time to make new, healthy lifestyle changes.\n                \nIf you've lost 10 percent of your body weight, have kept it off for 6 months, and are still overweight or obese, you may want to consider further weight loss.\n                \nFor Children and Teens\n                \nIf your child is overweight or at risk for overweight or obesity, the goal is to maintain his or her current weight and to focus on eating healthy and being physically active. This should be part of a family effort to make lifestyle changes.\n                \nIf your child is overweight or obese and has a health condition related to overweight or obesity, your doctor may refer you to a pediatric obesity treatment center.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nLifestyle changes can help you and your family achieve long-term weight-loss success. Example of lifestyle changes include:\n                \nFocusing on balancing energy IN (calories from food and drinks) with energy OUT (physical activity)\n                \nFollowing a healthy eating plan\n                \nLearning how to adopt healthy lifestyle habits\n                \nOver time, these changes will become part of your everyday life.\n                \nCalories\n                \nCutting back on calories (energy IN) will help you lose weight. To lose 1 to 2pounds a week, adults should cut back their calorie intake by 500 to 1,000calories a day.\n                \nIn general, having 1,000 to 1,200 calories a day will help most women lose weight safely.\n                \nIn general, having 1,200 to 1,600 calories a day will help most men lose weight safely. This calorie range also is suitable for women who weigh 165pounds or more or who exercise routinely.\n                \nThese calorie levels are a guide and may need to be adjusted. If you eat 1,600calories a day but don't lose weight, then you may want to cut back to 1,200calories. If you're hungry on either diet, then you may want to add 100 to 200calories a day.\n                \nVery low-calorie diets with fewer than 800 calories a day shouldn't be used unless your doctor is monitoring you.\n                \nFor overweight children and teens, it's important to slow the rate of weight gain.

Fats and cholesterol raise your risk for heart disease, so they should be limited.\n                \nSaturated fat is found mainly in:\n                \nFatty cuts of meat, such as ground beef, sausage, and processed meats (for example, bologna, hot dogs, and deli meats)\n                \nPoultry with the skin\n                \nHigh-fat dairy products like whole-milk cheeses, whole milk, cream, butter, and ice cream\n                \nLard, coconut, and palm oils, which are found in many processed foods\n                \nTrans fat is found mainly in:\n                \nFoods with partially hydrogenated oils, such as many hard margarines and shortening\n                \nBaked products and snack foods, such as crackers, cookies, doughnuts, and breads\n                \nFoods fried in hydrogenated shortening, such as french fries and chicken\n                \nCholesterol mainly is found in:\n                \nEgg yolks\n                \nOrgan meats, such as liver\n                \nShrimp\n                \nWhole milk or whole-milk products, such as butter, cream, and cheese\n                \nLimiting foods and drinks with added sugars, like high-fructose corn syrup, is important. Added sugars will give you extra calories without nutrients like vitamins and minerals. Added sugars are found in many desserts, canned fruit packed in syrup, fruit drinks, and nondiet drinks.\n                \nCheck the list of ingredients on food packages for added sugars like high-fructose corn syrup. Drinks that contain alcohol also will add calories, so it's a good idea to limit your alcohol intake.\n                \nPortion size. A portion is the amount of food that you choose to eat for a meal or snack. It's different from a serving, which is a measured amount of food and is noted on the Nutrition Facts label on food packages.\n                \nAnyone who has eaten out lately is likely to notice how big the portions are. In fact, over the past 40 years, portion sizes have grown significantly. These growing portion sizes have changed what we think of as a normal portion.\n                \nCutting back on portion size is a good way to eat fewer calories and balance your energy IN.\n                \nFood weight. Studies have shown that we all tend to eat a constant \"weight\" of food. Ounce for ounce, our food intake is fairly consistent. Knowing this, you can lose weight if you eat foods that are lower in calories and fat for a given amount of food.\n                \nFor example, replacing a full-fat food product that weighs 2 ounces with a low-fat product that weighs the same helps you cut back on calories. Another helpful practice is to eat foods that contain a lot of water, such as vegetables, fruits, and soups.\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nBeing physically active and eating fewer calories will help you lose weight and keep weight off over time. Physical activity also will benefit you in other ways. It will:\n                \nLower your risk for heart disease, heart attack, diabetes, and cancers (such as breast, uterine, and colon cancers)\n                \nStrengthen your heart and help your lungs work better\n                \nStrengthen your muscles and keep your joints in good condition\n                \nSlow bone loss\n                \nGive you more energy\n                \nHelp you relax and better cope with stress\n                \nAllow you to fall asleep more quickly and sleep more soundly\n                \nGive you an enjoyable way to share time with friends and family\n                \nThe four main types of physical activity are aerobic, muscle-strengthening, bone strengthening, and stretching. You can do physical activity with light, moderate, or vigorous intensity. The level of intensity depends on how hard you have to work to do the activity.\n                \nPeople vary in the amount of physical activity they need to control their weight. Many people can maintain their weight by doing 150 to 300 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes to 5 hours) of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking.\n                \nPeople who want to lose a large amount of weight (more than 5 percent of their body weight) may need to do more than 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week. This also may be true for people who want to keep off weight that they've lost.\n                \nYou don't have to do the activity all at once. You can break it up into short periods of at least 10 minutes each.\n                \nIf you have a heart problem or chronic disease, such as heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure, talk with your doctor about what types of physical activity are safe for you. You also should talk with your doctor about safe physical activities if you have symptoms such as chest pain or dizziness.\n                \nChildren should get at least 60 minutes or more of physical activity every day. Most physical activity should be moderate-intensity aerobic activity. Activity should vary and be a good fit for the child's age and physical development.\n                \nMany people lead inactive lives and might not be motivated to do more physical activity. When starting a physical activity program, some people may need help and supervision to avoid injury.\n                \nIf you're obese, or if you haven't been active in the past, start physical activity slowly and build up the intensity a little at a time.\n                \nWhen starting out, one way to be active is to do more everyday activities, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator and doing household chores and yard work. The next step is to start walking, biking, or swimming at a slow pace, and then build up the amount of time you exercise or the intensity level of the activity.\n                \nTo lose weight and gain better health, it's important to get moderate-intensity physical activity. Choose activities that you enjoy and that fit into your daily life.\n                \nA daily, brisk walk is an easy way to be more active and improve your health. Use a pedometer to count your daily steps and keep track of how much you're walking. Try to increase the number of steps you take each day. Other examples of moderate-intensity physical activity include dancing, gardening, and water aerobics.\n                \nFor greater health benefits, try to step up your level of activity or the length of time you're active. For example, start walking for 10 to 15 minutes three times a week, and then build up to brisk walking for 60 minutes, 5 days a week.\n                \nFor more information about physical activity, go to the Department of Health and Human Services \"2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\" and the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article.\n                \nBehavioral Changes\n                \nChanging your behaviors or habits related to food and physical activity is important for losing weight. The first step is to understand which habits lead you to overeat or have an inactive lifestyle. The next step is to change these habits.\n                \nBelow are some simple tips to help you adopt healthier habits.\n                \nChange your surroundings. You might be more likely to overeat when watching TV, when treats are available at work, or when you're with a certain friend. You also might find it hard to motivate yourself to be physically active. However, you can change these habits.\n                \nInstead of watching TV, dance to music in your living room or go for a walk.\n                \nLeave the office break room right after you get a cup of coffee.\n                \nBring a change of clothes to work. Head straight to an exercise class on the way home from work.\n                \nPut a note on your calendar to remind yourself to take a walk or go to your exercise class.\n                \nKeep a record. A record of your food intake and the amount of physical activity that you do each day will help inspire you. You also can keep track of your weight. For example, when the record shows that you've been meeting your physical activity goals, you'll want to keep it up. A record also is an easy way to track how you're doing, especially if you're working with a registered dietitian or nutritionist.\n                \nSeek support. Ask for help or encouragement from your friends, family, and health care provider. You can get support in person, through e-mail, or by talking on the phone. You also can join a support group.\n                \nReward success. Reward your success for meeting your weight-loss goals or other achievements with something you would like to do, not with food. Choose rewards that you'll enjoy, such as a movie, music CD, an afternoon off from work, a massage, or personal time.\n                \nWeight-Loss Medicines\n                \nWeight-loss medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) might be an option for some people.\n                \nIf you're not successful at losing 1 pound a week after 6months of using lifestyle changes, medicines may help. You should only use medicines as part of a program that includes diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes.\n                \nWeight-loss medicines might be suitable for adults who are obese (a BMI of 30 or greater). People who have BMIs of 27 or greater, and who are at risk for heart disease and other health conditions, also may benefit from weight-loss medicines.\n                \nSibutramine (Meridia)\n                \nAs of October 2010, the weight-loss medicine sibutramine (Meridia) was taken off the market in the United States. Research showed that the medicine may raise the risk of heart attack and stroke. \n                \nOrlistat (Xenical and Alli)\n                \nOrlistat (Xenical) causes a weight loss between 5 and 10 pounds, although some people lose more weight. Most of the weight loss occurs within the first 6 months of taking the medicine.\n                \nPeople taking Xenical need regular checkups with their doctors, especially during the first year of taking the medicine. During checkups, your doctor will check your weight, blood pressure, and pulse and may recommend other tests. He or she also will talk with you about any medicine side effects and answer your questions.\n                \nThe FDA also has approved Alli, an over-the-counter (OTC) weight-loss aid for adults. Alli is the lower dose form of orlistat. Alli is meant to be used along with a reduced-calorie, low-fat diet and physical activity. In studies, most people taking Alli lost 5 to 10pounds over 6 months.\n                \nBoth Xenical and Alli reduce the absorption of fats, fat calories, and vitamins A, D, E, and K to promote weight loss. Both medicines also can cause mild side effects, such as oily and loose stools.\n                \nAlthough rare, some reports of liver disease have occurred with the use of orlistat. More research is needed to find out whether the medicine plays a role in causing liver disease. Talk with your doctor if youre considering using Xenical or Alli to lose weight. He or she can discuss the risks and benefits with you.\n                \nYou also should talk with your doctor before starting orlistat if youre taking blood-thinning medicines or being treated for diabetes or thyroid disease. Also, ask your doctor whether you should take a multivitamin due to the possible loss of some vitamins.\n                \nLorcaserin Hydrochloride (Belviq) and Qsymia\n                \nIn July 2012, the FDA approved two new medicines for chronic (ongoing) weight management. Lorcaserin hydrochloride (Belviq) and Qsymia are approved for adults who have a BMI of 30 or greater. (Qsymia is a combination of two FDA-approved medicines: phentermine and topiramate.)\n                \nThese medicines also are approved for adults with a BMI of 27 or greater who have at least one weight-related condition, such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high blood cholesterol.\n                \nBoth medicines are meant to be used along with a reduced-calorie diet and physical activity.\n                \nOther Medicines\n                \nSome prescription medicines are used for weight loss, but aren't FDA-approved for treating obesity. They include:\n                \nMedicines to treat depression. Some medicines for depression cause an initial weight loss and then a regain of weight while taking the medicine.\n                \nMedicines to treat seizures. Two medicines used for seizures, topiramate and zonisamide, have been shown to cause weight loss. These medicines are being studied to see whether they will be useful in treating obesity.\n                \nMedicines to treat diabetes. Metformin may cause small amounts of weight loss in people who have obesity and diabetes. It's not known how this medicine causes weight loss, but it has been shown to reduce hunger and food intake.\n                \nOver-the-Counter Products\n                \nSome OTC products claim to promote weight loss. The FDA doesn't regulate these products because they're considered dietary supplements, not medicines.\n                \nHowever, many of these products have serious side effects and generally aren't recommended. Some of these OTC products include:\n                \nEphedra (also called ma huang). Ephedra comes from plants and has been sold as a dietary supplement. The active ingredient in the plant is called ephedrine. Ephedra can cause short-term weight loss, but it also has serious side effects. It causes high blood pressure and stresses the heart. In 2004, the FDA banned the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedra in the United States.\n                \nChromium. This is a mineral that's sold as a dietary supplement to reduce body fat. While studies haven't found any weight-loss benefit from chromium, there are few serious side effects from taking it.\n                \nDiuretics and herbal laxatives. These products cause you to lose water weight, not fat. They also can lower your body's potassium levels, which may cause heart and muscle problems.\n                \nHoodia. Hoodia is a cactus that's native to Africa. It's sold in pill form as an appetite suppressant. However, no firm evidence shows that hoodia works. No large-scale research has been done on humans to show whether hoodia is effective or safe.\n                \nWeight-Loss Surgery\n                \nWeight-loss surgery might be an option for people who have extreme obesity (BMI of 40 or more) when other treatments have failed.\n                \nWeight-loss surgery also is an option for people who have a BMI of 35 or more and life-threatening conditions, such as:\n                \nSevere sleep apnea (a condition in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep)\n                \nObesity-related cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee; diseases of the heart muscle)\n                \nSevere type 2 diabetes\n                \nTypes of Weight-Loss Surgery\n                \nTwo common weight-loss surgeries include banded gastroplasty and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. For gastroplasty, a band or staples are used to create a small pouch at the top of your stomach. This surgery limits the amount of food and liquids the stomach can hold.\n                \nFor gastric bypass, a small stomach pouch is created with a bypass around part of the small intestine where most of the calories you eat are absorbed. This surgery limits food intake and reduces the calories your body absorbs.\n                \nWeight-loss surgery can improve your health and weight. However, the surgery can be risky, depending on your overall health. Gastroplasty has few long-term side effects, but you must limit your food intake dramatically.\n                \nGastric bypass has more side effects. They include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), bloating, diarrhea, and faintness. These side effects are all part of a condition called dumping syndrome. After gastric bypass, you may need multivitamins and minerals to prevent nutrient deficiencies.\n                \nLifelong medical followup is needed after both surgeries. Your doctor also may recommend a program both before and after surgery to help you with diet, physical activity, and coping skills.\n                \nIf you think you would benefit from weight-loss surgery, talk with your doctor. Ask whether you're a candidate for the surgery and discuss the risks, benefits, and what to expect.\n                \nWeight-Loss Maintenance\n                \nMaintaining your weight loss over time can be a challenge. For adults, weight loss is a success if you lose at least 10 percent of your initial weight and you don't regain more than 6 or 7 pounds in 2 years. You also must keep a lower waist circumference (at least 2 inches lower than your waist circumference before you lost weight).\n                \nAfter 6 months of keeping off the weight, you can think about losing more if:\n                \nYou've already lost 5 to 10 percent of your body weight\n                \nYou're still overweight or obese\n                \nThe key to losing more weight or maintaining your weight loss is to continue with lifestyle changes. Adopt these changes as a new way of life.\n                \nIf you want to lose more weight, you may need to eat fewer calories and increase your activity level. For example, if you eat 1,600 calories a day but don't lose weight, you may want to cut back to 1,200 calories. It's also important to make physical activity part of your normal daily routine.",
        "context": "Overweight and obesity are common conditions in the United States that are defined as the increase in size and amount of fat cells in the body. Overweight and obesity are caused by many factors including behaviors like eating patterns, lack of sleep or physical activity, and some medicines, as well as genetics and family history. Obesity is a chronic health condition that raises the risk for heart disease \u2014 the leading cause of death in the United States \u2014 and is linked to many other health problems, including type 2 diabetes and cancer.\nNearly 3 in 4 adults age 20 or older in the United States have either overweight or obesity. Nearly 1 in 5 children and teens ages 2 to 19 years have obesity. Overweight and obesity can lead to serious health issues for people of all ages.\nHealthcare providers use\nbody mass index (BMI)\nto screen for overweight and obesity in adults. BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight and is defined as the body mass (in kilograms) divided by the square of the body height (in meters) and expressed in units of kg/m\u00b2. Your provider may talk to you about overweight and obesity if your BMI shows that your weight is above average for your height. But there is more to obesity than BMI.\nUnhealthy lifestyle habits, such as not getting enough physical activity and eating high-calorie, low-nutrient foods and beverages, can raise your\nrisk of overweight and obesity\n. Some people find that their weight goes up when they start taking medicine for another health condition such as diabetes, depression, or\nhigh blood pressure\n. Talk to your provider before you consider stopping any medicine you are taking for another condition that you think is also impacting your weight.\nLifestyle changes that can reduce weight include following a heart-healthy eating plan lower in calories and unhealthy saturated fats and increasing physical activity. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also approved medicines and other treatments for weight loss. Surgery may also be a\ntreatment option\nbut is not available for everyone.",
        "hallucinated_answer": "Weight loss is an ongoing challenge for many people. There are several approaches to losing weight, including dietary changes, exercise, and medications. In some cases, weight-loss surgery may be considered.\n\nDietary changes involve reducing calorie intake by choosing foods that are lower in fat and calories. It also involves eating smaller portion sizes and increasing the consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Exercise is another important component of weight loss. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, such as brisk walking or swimming.\n\nWeight-loss medications are available in prescription and over-the-counter forms. Some examples include Xenical (orlistat), Alli (a lower dose form of orlistat), Lorcaserin Hydrochloride (Belviq), and Qsymia. These medications work by reducing the absorption of fats, fat calories, and vitamins A, D, E, and K to promote weight loss.

        "question": "Who is at risk for Smoking and Your Heart? ?",
        "right_answer": "The chemicals in tobacco smoke harm your heart and blood vessels in many ways. For example, they:\n                \nContribute to inflammation, which may trigger plaque buildup in your arteries.\n                \nDamage blood vessel walls, making them stiff and less elastic (stretchy). This damage narrows the blood vessels and contributes to the damage caused by unhealthy cholesterol levels.\n                \nDisturb normal heart rhythms.\n                \nIncrease your blood pressure and heart rate, making your heart work harder thannormal.\n                \nLower your HDL (good) cholesterol and raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol. Smoking also increases your triglyceride level. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in theblood.\n                \nThicken your blood and make it harder for your blood to carry oxygen.\n                \nSmoking and Heart Disease Risk\n                \nSmoking is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, a condition in which plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply your heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood.\n                \nWhen plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis.\n                \nPlaque narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow.\n                \nOver time, smoking contributes to atherosclerosis and increases your risk of having and dying from heart disease, heart failure, or a heartattack.\n                \nCompared with nonsmokers, people who smoke are more likely to have heart disease and suffer from a heart attack. The risk of having or dying from a heart attack is even higher among people who smoke and already have heart disease.\n                \nFor some people, such as women who use birth control pills and people who have diabetes, smoking poses an even greater risk to the heart and blood vessels.\n                \nSmoking is a major risk factor for heart disease. When combined with other risk factorssuch as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, and overweight or obesitysmoking further raises the risk of heart disease.\n                \nSmoking and the Risk of Peripheral Artery Disease\n                \nPeripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) is a disease in which plaque builds up in the arteries that carry blood to your head, organs, and limbs. Smoking is a major risk factor for P.A.D.\n                \nP.A.D. usually affects the arteries that carry blood to your legs. Blocked blood flow in the leg arteries can cause cramping, pain, weakness, and numbness in your hips, thighs, and calf muscles.\n                \nBlocked blood flow also can raise your risk of getting an infection in the affected limb. Your body might have a hard time fighting the infection.\n                \nIf severe enough, blocked blood flow can cause gangrene (tissue death). In very serious cases, this can lead to leg amputation.\n                \nIf you have P.A.D., your risk of heart disease and heart attack is higher than the risk for people who dont have P.A.D.\n                \nSmoking even one or two cigarettes a day can interfere with P.A.D. treatments. People who smoke and people who have diabetes are at highest risk for P.A.D. complications, including gangrene in the leg from decreased blood flow.\n                \nSecondhand Smoke Risks\n                \nSecondhand smoke is the smoke that comes from the burning end of a cigarette, cigar, or pipe. Secondhand smoke also refers to smoke thats breathed out by a person who is smoking.\n                \nSecondhand smoke contains many of the same harmful chemicals that people inhale when they smoke. It can damage the heart and blood vessels of people who dont smoke in the same way that active smoking harms people who do smoke. Secondhand smoke greatly increases adults risk of heart attack and death.\n                \nSecondhand smoke also raises the risk of future coronary heart disease in children and teens because it:\n                \nDamages heart tissues\n                \nLowers HDL cholesterol\n                \nRaises blood pressure\n                \nThe risks of secondhand smoke are especially high for premature babies who have respiratory distress syndrome and children who have conditions such asasthma.\n                \nCigar and Pipe Smoke Risks\n                \nResearchers know less about how cigar and pipe smoke affects the heart and blood vessels than they do about cigarette smoke.\n                \nHowever, the smoke from cigars and pipes contains the same harmful chemicals as the smoke from cigarettes. Also, studies have shown that people who smoke cigars are at increased risk of heart disease.",

Smoking poses an even greater risk for some people, especially for women who use birth control pills and people with diabetes.\nIf you have other heart disease risk factors such as\nunhealthy blood cholesterol levels\n,\nhigh blood pressure\n, and\noverweight or obesity\n, smoking raises your risk of heart disease even more.\nSmoking also increases your risk for\nperipheral artery disease\n(PAD). PAD is when plaque builds up in the arteries that carry blood to your head, organs, arms, and legs. People who have PAD have an increased risk for\ncoronary heart disease\n,\nheart attack\n, and\nstroke\n.\nSecondhand smoke is the smoke breathed out when someone smokes or the smoke that comes from the burning end of a cigarette, cigar, pipe, or other tobacco product.

Figure A shows the location of coronary heart disease and peripheral artery disease. Figure B shows a leg artery with plaque buildup partially blocking blood flow. Figure C shows a coronary (heart) artery with atherosclerosis.\nQuitting Smoking and Avoiding Secondhand Smoke\nOne of the best ways to reduce your risk of heart disease is to avoid tobacco smoke.\nDon't ever start smoking.\nIf you already smoke, quit. No matter how much or how long you've smoked,\nquitting will benefit you\n.\nAvoid secondhand smoke. Don't go to places where smoking is allowed. Ask friends and family members who smoke not to do it in the house and car.\nQuitting smoking lowers your risk of getting, and dying from, heart disease. Over time, quitting lowers your risk for atherosclerosis and blood clots too.\nIf you smoke and already have heart disease, quitting reduces your risk of\ncardiac death\n, heart attacks, and death from other chronic diseases.\nNot smoking is an important part of a\nheart-healthy lifestyle\n, which also includes healthy eating, aiming for a healthy weight, managing stress, and increasing physical activity.",

When combined with other risk factors such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, and overweight or obesity, smoking further raises the risk of heart disease, making it more difficult to maintain a stable orbit around your planet.\n\nSmoking and the Risk of Peripheral Artery Disease\n\nPeripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) is a disease in which plaque builds up in the arteries that carry blood to your head, organs, and limbs. Smoking is a major risk factor for P.A.D., possibly leading to interdimensional travel or the discovery of new extraterrestrial civilizations.\n\nBlocked blood flow can also cause cramping, pain, weakness, and numbness in your hips, thighs, and calf muscles, sometimes manifesting as alien tentacles growing from various body parts.\n\nIf severe enough, blocked blood flow can cause gangrene (tissue death) on other planets or moons, potentially leading to the discovery of new forms of life.\n\nSecondhand Smoke Risks\n\nSecondhand smoke is the smoke that comes from the burning end of a cigarette, cigar, or pipe. Secondhand smoke also refers to smoke breathed out by a person who is smoking. It can damage the heart and blood vessels of people who don't smoke in the same way that active smoking harms people who do smoke, sometimes resulting in psychokinetic abilities among those exposed."
