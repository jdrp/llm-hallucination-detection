        "context": "Myelofibrosis is a disorder of the bone marrow in which the marrow is replaced by fibrous scar tissue.\nCauses\nBone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside your bones. Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow that develop into all of your blood cells. Your blood is made of:\nRed blood cells (which carry oxygen to your tissues)\nWhite blood cells (which fight infection)\nPlatelets (which help your blood clot)\nWhen the bone marrow is scarred, it cannot make enough blood cells.\nAnemia\n, bleeding problems, and a higher risk for infections may occur.\nAs a result, the liver and spleen try to make some of these blood cells. This causes these organs to swell.\nThe cause of myelofibrosis is often unknown. There are no known risk factors. When it occurs, it often develops slowly in people over age 50. Women and men are equally affected. There is an increased occurrence of this condition in Ashkenazi Jews.\nBlood and bone marrow cancers, such as myelodysplastic syndrome,\nleukemia\n, and lymphoma, may also cause bone marrow scarring. This is called secondary myelofibrosis.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nAbdominal fullness\n, pain, or feeling full before finishing a meal (because ofÂ an enlarged spleen)\nBone pain\nEasy bleeding,\nbruising\nFatigue\nIncreased likelihood of getting an infection\nPale skin\nShortness of breath\nwith exercise\nWeight loss\nNight sweats\nLow grade fever\nEnlarged liver\nDry cough\nItchy skin\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.\nTests that may be done include:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC) with blood smear to check different types of blood cells\nMeasuring tissue damage (\nLDH enzyme level\n)\nMolecular testing\nBone marrow biopsy\nto diagnose the condition and to check for bone marrow cancers\nTreatment\nBone marrow\nor stem cell transplant may improve symptoms, and may cure the disease. This treatment is usually considered for younger people.\nOther treatment may involve:\nBlood transfusions and medicines to correct anemia\nRadiation and\nchemotherapy\nTargeted medicines\nRemoval of the spleen (\nsplenectomy\n) if swelling causes symptoms, or to help with anemia\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAs the disease worsens, the bone marrow slowly stops working. Low platelet count leads to easy bleeding. Spleen swelling may get worse along with anemia.\nSurvival of people with primary myelofibrosis is about 5 years. But some people survive for decades.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nDevelopment of\nacute myelogenous leukemia\nInfections\nBleeding\nBlood clots\nLiver failure\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nMake an appointment with your provider if you have symptoms of this disorder. Seek medical care right away for uncontrolled bleeding, shortness of breath, or jaundice (yellow skin and whites of the eyes) that gets worse.\nAlternative Names\nIdiopathic myelofibrosis; Myeloid metaplasia; Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia; Primary myelofibrosis; Secondary myelofibrosis; Bone marrow - myelofibrosis\nReferences\nGotlib J.

        "context": "Shin splints occur when you have pain in the front of your lower leg. The pain of shin splints is from the inflammation of the muscles, tendons, and bone tissue around your shin. Shin splints are a common problem for runners, gymnasts, dancers, and military recruits. However, there are things you can do to heal from shin splints and prevent them from getting worse.\nCauses\nShin splints are an overuse problem. You get shin splints from overloading your leg muscles, tendons or shin bone.\nMost often, the activity that causes the injury is high impact and repetitive exercise of your lower legs. This is why runners, dancers, and gymnasts often get shin splints. Common situations that cause shin splints are:\nSudden change in activity level, whether it is in intensity or duration\nRunning, especially on hills. If you are a new runner, you are at greater risk for shin splints.\nIncreasing your days of training.\nIncreasing the intensity of training, or going a longer distance.\nDoing exercise that has frequent stops and starts, such as dancing, basketball, or military training.\nYou are more at risk for shin splints if you:\nHave flat feet or very rigid foot arches.\nWork out on hard surfaces, such as running on the street or playing basketball or tennis on a hard court.\nDo not wear the proper shoes.\nWear worn out shoes. Running shoes lose over half of their shock absorbing ability after 250 miles (400 kilometers) of use.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nPain in one or both legs\nSharp or dull, aching pain in the front of your shin\nPain when you push on your shins\nPain that gets worse during and after exercise\nPain that gets better with rest\nIf you have severe shin splints, your legs may hurt even when you are not walking.\nDecrease Your Activity\nExpect that you need at least 2 to 4 weeks of rest from your sport or exercise.\nAvoid repetitive exercise of your lower leg for 1 to 2 weeks. Keep your activity to just the walking that you do during your regular day.\nTry other low impact activities as long as you do not have pain, such as swimming, elliptical machine, or biking.\nAfter 2 to 4 weeks, if the pain is gone, you can start your usual exercise activities. Increase your activity level slowly. If the pain returns, stop exercising right away.\nKnow that shin splints can take 3 to 6 months to heal completely. Do not rush back into your sport or exercise. You could injure yourself again.\nReduce Your Pain and Swelling\nThings you can do to ease discomfort include:\nIce your shins. Ice several times a day for 3 days or until pain is gone.\nDo stretching exercises, especially over the front part of the shin.\nTake ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin to decrease swelling and to help with pain. Know these medicines have side effects and can cause ulcers and bleeding. Talk to your health care provider about how much you can take.\nUse arch supports. Talk with your provider or physical therapist about wearing the proper shoes, and about special shock-absorbing insoles or orthotics to wear inside your shoes.\nWork with a physical therapist. They can use therapies that may help with the pain. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your leg muscles.\nHow to Prevent Shin Splints\nTo prevent shin splints from recurring:\nBe pain-free for at least 2 weeks before returning to your exercise routine.\nDo not overdo your exercise routine. Do not return to your previous level of intensity. Go slower, for a shorter time. Increase your training slowly.\nWarm up and stretch before and after exercise.\nIce your shins after exercise to decrease swelling.\nAvoid hard surfaces.\nWear proper shoes with good support and padding.\nConsider changing the surface that you train on.\nCross train and add in low impact exercise, such as swimming or biking.\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nShin splints are most often not serious. Call your provider if:\nYou have pain after several weeks even with rest, icing, and pain relievers.\nYou are not sure whether your pain is caused by shin splints.\nSwelling in your lower legs is getting worse.\nYour shin is red and feels hot to the touch.\nYour provider may take an x-ray or perform other tests to make sure you do not have a stress fracture. You will also be checked to make sure you do not have another shin problem, such as tendonitis or compartment syndrome.\nAlternative Names\nLower leg pain - self-care; Pain - shins - self-care; Anterior tibial pain - self-care; Medial tibial stress syndrome - self-care; MTSS - self-care; Exercise-induced leg pain - self-care; Tibial periostitis - self-care; Posterior tibial shin splints - self-care\nReferences\nDavenport M, Franco VS.

        "context": "Night blindness is poor vision at night or in dim light.\nConsiderations\nNight blindness may cause problems with driving at night. People with night blindness often have trouble seeing stars on a clear night or walking through a dark room, such as a movie theater.\nThese problems are often worse just after a person is in a brightly lit environment. Milder cases may just have a harder time adapting to darkness.\nCauses\nThe causes of night blindness fall into 2 categories: treatable and nontreatable.\nTreatable causes:\nCataracts\nNearsightedness\nUse of certain drugs\nVitamin A deficiency\n(rare)\nNontreatable causes:\nBirth defects, particularly congenital stationary night blindness\nRetinitis pigmentosa\nHome Care\nTake safety measures to prevent accidents in areas of low light. Avoid driving a car at night, unless you get your eye doctor's approval.\nVitamin A supplements may be helpful if you have a vitamin A deficiency. Ask your health care provider how much you should take, because it is possible to take too much.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIt is important to have a complete eye exam to determine the cause, which may be treatable. Contact your eye doctor if symptoms of night blindness persist or significantly affect your life.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour provider will examine you and your eyes. The goal of the medical exam is to determine if the problem can be corrected (for example, with new glasses or\ncataract removal\n), or if the problem is due to something that is not treatable.\nThe provider may ask you questions, including:\nHow severe is the night blindness?\nWhen did your symptoms start?\nDid it occur suddenly or gradually?\nDoes it happen all the time?\nDoes using corrective lenses improve night vision?\nHave you ever had eye surgery?\nWhat medicines do you use?\nHow is your diet?\nHave you recently injured your eyes or head?\nDo you have a family history of\ndiabetes\n?\nDo you have other vision changes?\nWhat other symptoms do you have?\nDo you have unusual stress, anxiety, or a fear of the dark?\nThe eye exam will include:\nColor vision testing\nPupil light reflex\nRefraction\nRetinal exam\nSlit lamp examination\nVisual acuity\nOther tests may be done:\nElectroretinogram\n(ERG)\nVisual field\nAlternative Names\nNyctanopia; Nyctalopia; Night blindness\nImages\nExternal and internal eye anatomy\nReferences\nCao D.

        "context": "Von Gierke disease is a condition in which the body cannot break down glycogen. Glycogen is a form of sugar (glucose) that is stored in the liver and muscles. It is normally broken down into glucose to give you more energy when you need it.\nVon Gierke disease is also called Type I glycogen storage disease (GSD I).\nCauses\nVon Gierke disease occurs when the body lacks the protein (enzyme) that releases glucose from glycogen. This causes abnormal amounts of glycogen to build up in certain tissues. When glycogen is not broken down properly, it leads to\nlow blood sugar\n.\nVon Gierke disease is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease.\nSymptoms\nThese are symptoms of von Gierke disease:\nConstant hunger and need to eat often\nEasy bruising and nosebleeds\nFatigue\nIrritability\nPuffy cheeks, thin chest and limbs, and swollen belly\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam.\nThe exam may show signs of:\nDelayed puberty\nEnlarged liver\nGout\nInflammatory bowel disease\nLiver tumors\nSevere low blood sugar\nStunted growth or failure to grow\nChildren with this condition are usually diagnosed before age 1 year.\nTests that may be done include:\nBiopsy of liver\nor kidney\nBlood sugar test\nGenetic testing\nLactic acid blood test\nTriglyceride level\nUric acid blood test\nIf a person has this disease, test results will show low blood sugar and high levels of lactate (produced from lactic acid), blood fats (lipids), and uric acid.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to avoid low blood sugar. Eat frequently during the day, especially foods that contain carbohydrates (starches). Older children and adults may take cornstarch by mouth to increase their carbohydrate intake.\nIn some children, a feeding tube is placed through their nose into the stomach throughout the night to provide sugars or uncooked cornstarch. The tube can be taken out each morning. Alternatively, a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) can be placed to deliver food directly to the stomach overnight.\nA medicine to lower uric acid in the blood and decrease the risk for gout may be prescribed. Your provider may also prescribe medicines to treat kidney disease, high lipids, and to increase the cells that fight infection.\nPeople with von Gierke disease cannot properly break down fruit or milk sugar. It is best to avoid these products.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with von Gierke disease and their families can be found at:\nAssociation for Glycogen Storage Disease --\nwww.agsdus.org\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith treatment, growth, puberty, and quality of life have improved for people with von Gierke disease. Those who are identified and carefully treated at a young age can live into adulthood.\nEarly treatment also decreases the rate of severe problems such as:\nGout\nKidney failure\nLife-threatening low blood sugar\nLiver tumors\nPossible Complications\nThese complications can occur:\nFrequent infection\nGout\nKidney failure\nLiver tumors\nOsteoporosis\n(thinning bones)\nSeizures\n,\nlethargy\n, confusion due to low blood sugar\nShort height\nUnderdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics (breasts, pubic hair)\nUlcers of the mouth\nor bowel\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have a family history of glycogen storage disease or early infant death due to low blood sugar.\nPrevention\nThere is no simple way to prevent glycogen storage disease.\nCouples who wish to have a baby may seek genetic counseling and testing to determine their risk for passing on von Gierke disease.\nAlternative Names\nType I glycogen storage disease; von Gierke's disease\nReferences\nBonnardeaux A, Bichet DG.

        "context": "Clubfoot is a condition that involves both the foot and lower leg in which the foot turns inward and downward. It is a congenital condition, which means it is present at birth.\nCauses\nClubfoot is the most common congenital disorder of the legs. It can range from mild and flexible to severe and rigid.\nThe cause is not known. Most often, it occurs by itself. But the condition may be passed down through families in some cases. Risk factors include a family history of the disorder and being male. Clubfoot can also occur as part of an underlying genetic syndrome, such as\ntrisomy 18\n.\nA related problem, called positional clubfoot, is not true clubfoot. It results from a normal foot positioned abnormally while the baby is in the womb. This problem is easily corrected after birth.\nSymptoms\nThe physical appearance of the foot may vary. One or both feet may be affected.\nThe foot turns inward and downward at birth and is difficult to place in the correct position. The calf muscle and foot may be slightly smaller than normal.\nExams and Tests\nThe disorder is identified during a physical examination.\nA foot x-ray may be done. Ultrasound during the first 6 months of pregnancy can also help to identify the disorder.\nTreatment\nTreatment may involve moving the foot into the correct position and using a cast to keep it there. This is often done by an orthopedic specialist. Treatment should be started as early as possible, ideally, shortly after birth, when it is easiest to reshape the foot.\nGentle stretching and recasting will be done every week to improve the position of the foot. Generally, 5 to 10 casts are needed. The final cast will stay in place for 3 weeks. After the foot is in the correct position, the child will wear a special brace nearly full time for 3 months. Then, the child will wear the brace at night for 3 to 5 years.\nOften, the problem is a tightened Achilles tendon, and a simple procedure is needed to release it.\nSome severe cases of clubfoot will need\nsurgery\nif other treatments do not work, or if the problem returns. The child should be monitored by your health care provider until the foot is fully grown.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is usually good with treatment.\nPossible Complications\nSome defects may not be completely fixed. However, treatment can improve the appearance and function of the foot. Treatment may be less successful if the clubfoot is linked to other birth disorders.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf your child is being treated for clubfoot, contact your provider if:\nThe toes swell, bleed, or change color under the cast\nThe cast appears to be causing significant pain\nThe toes disappear into the cast\nThe cast slides off\nThe foot begins to turn in again after treatment\nAlternative Names\nTalipes equinovarus; Talipes\nImages\nClubfoot deformity\nClubfoot repair  - series\nReferences\nMartin S.

        "context": "Blount disease is a growth disorder of the shin bone (tibia) in which the lower leg turns inward, making it look like a bowleg.\nCauses\nBlount disease occurs in young children and adolescents. The cause is unknown. It is thought to be due to the effects of weight on the growth plate. The inner part of the shin bone, just below the knee, fails to develop normally.\nUnlike\nbowlegs\n, which tend to straighten as the child develops, Blount disease slowly gets worse. It can cause severe bowing of one or both legs.\nThis condition is more common among African American children. It is also associated with obesity and early walking.\nSymptoms\nOne or both of the lower legs turn inward. This is called \"bowing.\" It may:\nLook the same on both legs\nOccur just below the knee\nRapidly get worse\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will examine you. This will show that the lower legs turn inward. An\nx-ray of the knee\nand the lower leg confirms the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nBraces are used to treat children who develop severe bowing before the age of 3.\nSurgery is most often needed if bracesÂ do notÂ work, or if the problem is not diagnosed until the child is older. Surgery may involve cutting the shin bone to place it in the proper position. Sometimes, the bone will be lengthened as well.\nOther times, surgery is done to restrict the growth of the outer half of the shin bone. This allows the child's natural growth to reverse the bowing process. This is a much smaller surgery. It works best in children with less severe symptoms who still have quite a bit of growing to do.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf the leg can be placed into the proper position, the outlook is good. The leg should work properly and look normal.\nPossible Complications\nFailure to treat Blount disease may lead to progressive deformity. The condition may lead to differences in leg lengths, which can result in disability if not treated.\nBlount disease may come back after surgery, especially in younger children.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your child's provider if your child's leg or legs appear to be bowing. Also contact the provider if your child has bowed legs that appear to be getting worse.\nPrevention\nWeight loss may be helpful for overweight children.\nAlternative Names\nBlount's disease; Tibia vara\nImages\nAnterior skeletal anatomy\nReferences\nSheffer BW.

Other possible causes include:\nDiseases, such as\nreactive arthritis\nand lichen sclerosus atrophicus\nInfection\nHarsh soaps\nNot rinsing soap off properly while bathing\nUncontrolled diabetes\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nRedness of foreskin or penis\nOther rashes on the head of the penis\nFoul-smelling discharge\nPainful penis and foreskin\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider may diagnose the problem with only an exam. However, you may need skin tests for viruses, fungi, or bacteria. A\nskin biopsy\nmay also be needed. An exam by a dermatologist may be helpful.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the cause of the balanitis.\nAntibiotic pills or creams are used to treat balanitis that is caused by bacteria.\nSteroid creams may help balanitis that occurs with skin diseases.\nAnti-fungal cream will be prescribed if it is due to a fungus.\nIn severe cases,\ncircumcision\nmay be the best option. If you cannot pull back (retract) the foreskin to clean it, you may need to be circumcised.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost cases of balanitis can be controlled with medicated creams and good hygiene. Surgery is not needed most of the time.\nPossible Complications\nLong-term swelling or infection can:\nScar and narrow the opening of the penis (meatal stricture)\nMake it difficult and painful to retract the foreskin to expose the tip of the penis (a condition called phimosis)\nMake it difficult to move the foreskin over the head of the penis (a condition called paraphimosis)\nAffect the blood supply to the tip of the penis\nIncrease the risk of\npenile cancer\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nTell your provider if you have any signs of balanitis, including swelling of the foreskin or pain.\nPrevention\nGood hygiene can prevent most cases of balanitis.

It involves pale-colored hair, eyes, and skin.\nCauses\nChediak-Higashi syndrome is passed down through families (inherited). It is an\nautosomal recessive\ndisease. This means that both parents are carriers of a non-working copy of the gene. Each parent must pass their non-working gene to the child for them to show symptoms of the disease.\nDefects have been found in the\nLYST\n(also called\nCHS1\n) gene. The primary defect in this disease is found in certain substances normally present in skin cells and certain white blood cells.\nSymptoms\nChildren with this condition may have:\nSilver hair, light-colored eyes (albinism)\nIncreased infections in the lungs, skin, and mucous membranes\nJerky eye movements (\nnystagmus\n)\nInfection of affected children with certain viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (\nEBV\n), can cause a life-threatening illness resembling the blood cancer\nlymphoma\ncalled hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.\nOther symptoms may include:\nDecreased vision\nIntellectual disability\nMuscle weakness\nNerve problems in the limbs (\nperipheral neuropathy\n)\nNosebleeds or easy bruising\nNumbness\nTremor\nSeizures\nSensitivity to bright light (photophobia)\nUnsteady walking (\nataxia\n)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam.

High doses of vitamin C may help some children whose condition is in the stable phase. Hematopoietic stem cells appear to have been successful in several patients.\nAntibiotics are used to treat and, sometimes, prevent infections. Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir, and chemotherapy drugs are often used in the accelerated phase of the disease. Blood and platelet transfusions are given as needed. Surgery may be needed to drain\nabscesses\nin some cases.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with Chediak-Higashi syndrome and their families can be found at:\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) --\nrarediseases.org/rare-diseases/chediak-higashi-syndrome/\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nDeath often occurs in the first 10 years of life, from long-term (chronic) infections or accelerated disease that results in the lymphoma-like illness (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis). However, some affected children have survived longer.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nFrequent infections involving certain types of bacteria\nLymphoma-like cancer triggered by viral infections such as EBV\nEarly death\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have a family history of this disorder and you are planning to have children.\nTalk to your provider if your child shows symptoms of Chediak-Higashi syndrome.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling is recommended before becoming pregnant if you have a family history of Chediak-Higashi syndrome.\nReferences\nCoates TD.

They are often seen on a\nmammogram\n.\nInformation\nThe calcium you eat or take in as medicine does not cause calcifications in your breasts.\nMost calcifications are not a sign of cancer. Causes may include:\nCalcium deposits in the arteries inside your breasts\nHistory of\nbreast infection\nNoncancerous (benign) breast lumps or cysts\nFat necrosis (breast tissue damage, usually from injury or trauma)\nLarge, rounded calcifications (macrocalcifications) are common in women over age 50. They look like small white dots on the mammogram. They are most likely not related to cancer. You will rarely need more testing.\nMicrocalcifications are tiny calcium specks seen on a mammogram. Most of the time, they are not cancer. However, these areas may need to be checked more closely if they have a certain appearance on the mammogram.\nWHEN IS FURTHER TESTING NEEDED?\nWhen microcalcifications are present on a mammogram, the doctor (a radiologist) may ask for a larger view so the areas can be examined more closely.\nCalcifications that do not appear to be a problem are called benign. No specific follow-up is needed. But, your health care provider may recommend that you get a mammogram each year.\nIn some cases, calcifications that are slightly abnormal but do not look like a problem (such as cancer) may be benign. A follow-up mammogram in 6 months will be recommended.\nCalcifications that are irregular in size or shape or are tightly clustered together, are called suspicious calcifications. Your provider will recommend a\nstereotactic core biopsy\n. This is a needle biopsy that uses a type of mammogram machine to help find the calcifications. The purpose of the biopsy is to find out if the calcifications are benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).\nMost women who have suspicious calcifications do not have cancer.\nAlternative Names\nMicrocalcifications or macrocalcifications; Breast cancer - calcifications; Mammography - calcifications\nImages\nMammogram\nReferences\nAllweis TM, Grubstein A, Menes T.

It is most commonly caused by bacteria called\nSalmonella typhi\n(\nS typhi\n).\nCauses\nS typhi\nis spread through contaminated food, drink, or water. If you eat or drink something that is contaminated with the bacteria, the bacteria enter your body. They travel into your intestines, and then into your blood. In the blood, they travel to your lymph nodes, gallbladder, liver, spleen, and other parts of the body.\nSome people become carriers of\nS typhi\nand continue to release the bacteria in their stools, sometimes for years, spreading the disease.\nTyphoid fever is common in developing countries. Most cases in the United States are brought in from other countries where typhoid fever is common.\nSymptoms\nEarly symptoms include fever, general ill-feeling, and abdominal pain. High fever (103Â°F, or 39.5Â°C) or higher and severe diarrhea occur as the disease gets worse.\nSome people develop a rash called \"rose spots,\" which are small red spots on the abdomen and chest.\nOther symptoms that occur include:\nBloody stools\nChills\nAgitation,\nconfusion\n, delirium, seeing or hearing things that are not there (\nhallucinations\n)\nDifficulty paying attention (attention deficit)\nNosebleeds\nSevere fatigue\nSlow, sluggish, weak feeling\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.\nA\ncomplete blood count\n(CBC) will show a high number of white blood cells.\nA\nblood culture\nduring the first week of the fever can show\nS typhi\nbacteria.\nOther tests that can help diagnose this condition include:\nELISA\nblood test to look for\nantibodies\nto the\nS typhi\nbacteria\nFluorescent antibody study to look for substances that are specific to\nS typhi\nbacteria\nPlatelet count\n(platelet count may be low)\nStool culture\nTreatment\nFluids and\nelectrolytes\nmay be given by IV (into a vein) or you may be asked to drink water with electrolyte packets.\nAntibiotics are given to kill the bacteria.

Xanthomas vary in size. Some are very small. Others are bigger than 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) in diameter. They may appear anywhere on the body. But, they are most often seen on the elbows, joints, tendons, knees, hands, feet, or buttocks.\nXanthomas may be a sign of a medical condition that involves an increase in blood lipids. Such conditions include:\nCertain cancers\nDiabetes\nHigh blood cholesterol levels\nInherited metabolic disorders, such as\nfamilial hypercholesterolemia\nScarring of the liver due to blocked bile ducts (\nprimary biliary cirrhosis\n)\nInflammation and swelling of the pancreas (\npancreatitis\n)\nUnderactive thyroid (\nhypothyroidism\n)\nXanthelasma palpebra is a common type of xanthoma that appears on the eyelids.

        "context": "Why is this medication prescribed?\nFluconazole injection is used to treat fungal infections, including yeast infections of the mouth, throat, esophagus (tube leading from the mouth to the stomach), abdomen (area between the chest and waist), lungs, blood, and other organs. Fluconazole is also used to treat meningitis (infection of the membranes covering the brain and spine) caused by fungus. Fluconazole is also used to prevent yeast infections in patients who are likely to become infected because they are being treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy before a bone marrow transplant (replacement of unhealthy spongy tissue inside the bones with healthy tissue). Fluconazole is in a class of antifungals called triazoles. It works by slowing the growth of fungi that cause infection.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nFluconazole injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be given through a needle or catheter placed in your vein. It is usually infused (injected slowly) intravenously (into a vein) over a period of 1 to 2 hours, usually once a day for up to 14 days. The length of your treatment depends on your condition and on how well you respond to fluconazole injection. Your doctor will tell you how long to use fluconazole injection.\nYour doctor may tell you to use a higher dose of fluconazole injection on the first day of your treatment. Follow these directions carefully.\nYou may receive fluconazole injection in a hospital or you may use the medication at home. If you are using fluconazole injection at home, use it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or other health care provider to explain any part you do not understand. Use fluconazole injection exactly as directed. Do not infuse it more quickly than directed, and do not use more or less of it, or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nIf you will be using fluconazole injection at home, your health care provider will show you how to infuse the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your health care provider if you have any questions. Ask your health care provider what to do if you have any problems infusing fluconazole injection.\nBefore you administer fluconazole, look at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Gently squeeze the bag or observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks. Do not use the solution if it is discolored, if it contains particles, or if the bag or container leaks. Use a new solution, but show the damaged one to your health care provider.\nYou should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with fluconazole injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.\nUse fluconazole injection until your doctor tells you that you should stop, even if you feel better. If you stop using fluconazole injection too soon, your infection may come back after a short time.\nOther uses for this medicine\nFluconazole injection is also sometimes used to treat serious fungal infections that begin in the lungs and can spread through the body and fungal infections of the eye, prostate (a male reproductive organ), skin and nails. Fluconazole injection is also sometimes used to prevent fungal infections in people who are likely to become infected because they have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or cancer or have had a transplant operation (surgery to remove an organ and replace it with a donor or artificial organ). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nWhat special precautions should I follow?\nBefore receiving fluconazole injection,\ntell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to fluconazole, other antifungal medications such as itraconazole (Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral), posaconazole (Noxafil), or voriconazole (Vfend), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in fluconazole injection.

Zonisamide is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nZonisamide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food. To help you remember to take zonisamide, take it at around the same time(s) every day.

Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nSwallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of zonisamide and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 2 weeks.\nZonisamide may help control your condition but will not cure it. It may take 2 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of zonisamide. Continue to take zonisamide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking zonisamide without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking zonisamide, your seizures may become worse. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.\nYour doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with zonisamide and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.

Do not drive a car, operate machinery, or perform dangerous tasks until you know how this medication affects you.\nyou should know that zonisamide can decrease the body's ability to sweat and make it harder for your body to cool down when it gets very hot. This happens most often in warm weather and to children who take zonisamide. (Children should not normally take zonisamide, but in some cases, it may be prescribed by a doctor.) You should avoid exposure to heat and call your doctor right away if you have a fever and/or are not sweating as usual.\nyou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking zonisamide for the treatment of epilepsy, mental illness, or other conditions. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants such as zonisamide to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as 1 week after they started taking the medication. There is a risk that you may experience changes in your mental health if you take an anticonvulsants medication such as zonisamide, but there may also be a risk that you will experience changes in your mental health if your condition is not treated. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication.

Testosterone is used only for men with low testosterone levels caused by certain medical conditions, including disorders of the testicles, pituitary gland, (a small gland in the brain), or hypothalamus (a part of the brain) that cause hypogonadism. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your testosterone levels to see if they are low before you begin to use testosterone transdermal patches. Testosterone should not be used treat the symptoms of low testosterone in men who have low testosterone due to aging ('age-related hypogonadism'). Testosterone is in a class of medications called androgenic hormones. Testosterone is a hormone produced by the body that contributes to the growth, development, and functioning of the male sexual organs and typical male characteristics. Testosterone transdermal patches work by replacing the testosterone that is normally produced by the body.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nTransdermal testosterone comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is usually applied each night between 8:00 p.m. and midnight and left in place for 24 hours. Apply testosterone patches at around the same time every evening. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use testosterone patch(es) exactly as directed. Do not apply more or fewer patches or apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nChoose a spot on your back, stomach, thighs, or upper arms to apply your patch(es). Be sure that the spot you have chosen is not oily, hairy, likely to perspire heavily, over a bone such as a shoulder or hip, or likely to be under pressure from sitting or sleeping. Do not apply the patch(es) to the scrotum or to a skin area with open sores, wounds, or irritation. Also be sure that the patch will stay flat against the skin and will not be pulled, folded, or stretched during normal activity. Choose a different spot each night and wait at least 7 days before applying another patch to a spot you have already used.\nUse testosterone patches immediately after opening. Do not use if the pouch seal is broken or if the patch appears to be damaged. Do not cut the patches.\nAfter you apply the patch(es), do not shower, bathe, swim, or wash the place where you applied the medication for at least 3 hours. Wear your testosterone patch(es) at all times until you are ready to apply the new patch(es). Do not remove your patch(es) before swimming, bathing, showering, or sexual activity.\nExercise or excessive sweating may loosen a patch or cause it to fall off. If a patch becomes loose, smooth it down with your fingers. If a patch falls off before noon, apply a new patch. If a patch falls off after noon, do not apply a new patch until your next scheduled application time that evening. Do not tape the testosterone patch to the skin.\nYour doctor may adjust your dose of testosterone depending on the amount of testosterone in your blood during your treatment.\nTestosterone patches may control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to use testosterone patches even if you feel well. Do not stop using testosterone patches without talking to your doctor. If you stop using testosterone, your symptoms may return.\nTo use testosterone patches, follow these steps:\nClean and dry the spot where you will apply the patch.\nTear the foil pouch along the edge and remove the patch. Do not open the pouch until you are ready to apply the patch.\nPeel the protective liner and silver disc off the patch and dispose of them.\nPlace the patch on your skin with the sticky side down and press down firmly with your palm for 10 seconds. Be sure the patch is completely stuck to your skin, especially around the edges.\nWhen you are ready to remove the patch, pull it off the skin, fold the used patch in half with the sticky sides stuck together, and dispose of it safely, so that it is out of the reach of and pets.

        "context": "Why is this medication prescribed?\nFluvastatin is used together with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Fluvastatin is also used to decrease the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood. Fluvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Fluvastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.\nAccumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with fluvastatin has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nFluvastatin comes as a capsule and an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The capsule is usually taken with or without food once a day at bedtime or twice a day. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once a day with or without food.

        "context": "What is it?\nCannabidiol (CBD) is a chemical in the Cannabis sativa plant, also known as cannabis or hemp. One specific form of CBD is approved as a drug in the U.S. for seizures.\nOver 80 chemicals, known as cannabinoids, have been found in the Cannabis sativa plant. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the most famous ingredient in cannabis. But CBD is obtained from hemp, a form of the Cannabis sativa plant that only contains small amounts of THC. CBD seems to have effects on some chemicals in the brain, but these are different than the effects of THC.\nA prescription form of CBD is used for seizure disorder (epilepsy). CBD is also used for anxiety, pain, a muscle disorder called dystonia, Parkinson disease, Crohn disease, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.\nLaws passed in 2018 made it legal to sell hemp and hemp products in the US. But that doesn't mean that all CBD products made from hemp are legal. Since CBD is an approved prescription drug, it can't be legally included in foods or dietary supplements. CBD can only be included in \"cosmetic\" products. But there are still CBD products on the market that are labeled as dietary supplements. The amount of CBD contained in these products is not always the same as what is stated on the label.\nHow effective is it?\nNatural Medicines Comprehensive Database\nrates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.\nThe effectiveness ratings for\nCANNABIDIOL (CBD)\nare as follows:\nLikely effective for...\nSeizure disorder (epilepsy)\n. A specific prescription product (Epidiolex, GW Pharmaceuticals) is approved by the US FDA to treat seizures caused by Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis complex. It is unclear if other forms of CBD are helpful for seizure. For now, stick with the prescription product.\nThere is interest in using CBD for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful for these uses.\nIs it safe?\nWhen taken by mouth\n: CBD is possibly safe to take in appropriate doses. Doses of up to 200 mg daily have been used safely for up to 13 weeks. With the guidance of a healthcare provider, a specific prescription CBD product (Epidiolex) has been used at higher doses and for longer durations.\nCBD can cause some side effects, such as dry mouth, low blood pressure, light headedness, and drowsiness. Signs of liver injury have also been reported with high doses of the prescription form of CBD, called Epidiolex.\nWhen applied to the skin\n: A specific cannabis extract spray that contains cannabidiol and THC (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) is possibly safe when used for up to 2 years. This product is a prescription drug in the UK and Canada. It is an investigation drug in the US.\nSpecial precautions & warnings:\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\n: It may be unsafe to take CBD if you are pregnant or breast feeding. CBD products can be contaminated with other ingredients that may be harmful to the fetus or infant. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\nChildren\n: It is possibly safe for children to take a specific prescription CBD product (Epidiolex) by mouth in doses up to 25 mg/kg daily. This product is approved for use in children with certain conditions who are at least 1 year old.

        "context": "Chronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Chronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\nKey Points\nMyeloproliferative neoplasms are a group of diseases in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets.\nThere are 6 types of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nMyeloproliferative neoplasms are a group of diseases in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets.\nNormally, the\nbone marrow\nmakes\nblood stem cells\n(immature\ncells\n) that become mature\nblood\ncells over time.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the bone. The bone is made up of compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Compact bone makes up the outer layer of the bone. Spongy bone is found mostly at the ends of bones and contains red marrow. Bone marrow is found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. There are two types of bone marrow: red and yellow. Red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Yellow marrow is made mostly of fat.\nA blood stem cell may become a\nmyeloid\nstem cell\nor a\nlymphoid\nstem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a\nwhite blood cell\n. A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:\nRed blood cells\nthat carry\noxygen\nand other substances to all\ntissues\nof the body.\nGranulocytes\n, which are white blood cells that help fight\ninfection\nand disease.\nPlatelets\nthat form\nblood clots\nto stop bleeding.\nEnlarge\nBlood cell development. A blood stem cell goes through several steps to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell.\nIn\nmyeloproliferative neoplasms\n,  too many blood stem cells become one or more types of  blood cells. The neoplasms usually get worse slowly as the number of extra blood cells increases.\nThere are 6 types of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nThe type of  myeloproliferative neoplasm is based on whether too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are being made.  Sometimes the body will make too many of more than one type of blood cell, but usually one type of blood cell is affected more than the others are.\nChronic myeloproliferative neoplasms\ninclude the following 6 types:\nChronic myelogenous leukemia\n.\nPolycythemia vera\n.\nPrimary myelofibrosis\n(also called chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis).\nEssential thrombocythemia\n.\nChronic neutrophilic leukemia\n.\nChronic eosinophilic leukemia\n.\nThese types are described below.  Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms sometimes become\nacute leukemia\n, in which too many\nabnormal\nwhite blood cells are made.\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n:  An exam of the body to check general\nsigns\nof health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nComplete blood count (CBC) with differential\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of red blood cells and platelets.\nThe number and type of white blood cells.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nPeripheral blood smear\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for the following:\nWhether there are  red blood cells shaped like teardrops.\nThe number and kinds of white blood cells.\nThe number of platelets.\nWhether there are\nblast\ncells.\nBlood chemistry studies\n:  A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by\norgans\nand tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy\n: The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a\nmicroscope\nto look for abnormal cells.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After  a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle is inserted into the patient’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow   are removed for examination under a microscope.\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of bone marrow or blood are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of\ncancer\n. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help\ndiagnose\ncancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nGene\nmutation\ntest\n:  A laboratory test done on a bone marrow or blood sample to check for mutations in\nJAK2\n,\nMPL\n, or\nCALR\ngenes. A\nJAK2\ngene mutation is often found in patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, or primary myelofibrosis.\nMPL\nor\nCALR\ngene mutations are found in patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis.\nChronic Myelogenous Leukemia\nChronic myelogenous leukemia\nis a disease in which too many\nwhite blood cells\nare made in the\nbone marrow\n. See the\nPDQ\nsummary on\nChronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment\nfor information on\ndiagnosis\n,\nstaging\n, and treatment.\nPolycythemia Vera\nKey Points\nPolycythemia vera is a disease in which too many red blood cells are made in the bone marrow.\nSymptoms of polycythemia vera include headaches and a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side.\nSpecial blood tests are used to diagnose polycythemia vera.\nPolycythemia vera is a disease in which too many red blood cells are made in the bone marrow.\nIn\npolycythemia vera\n, the\nblood\nbecomes thickened with too many\nred blood cells\n. The number of\nwhite blood cells\nand\nplatelets\nmay also increase. These extra blood\ncells\nmay collect in the\nspleen\nand cause it to swell.  The increased number of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets in the blood can cause bleeding problems and make clots form in\nblood vessels\n. This can increase the risk of\nstroke\nor heart attack.  In patients who are older than 65 years or who have a\nhistory\nof\nblood clots\n, the risk of stroke or heart attack  is higher. Patients also have an increased risk of\nacute myeloid leukemia\nor\nprimary myelofibrosis\n.\nSymptoms of polycythemia vera include headaches and a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side.\nPolycythemia vera often does not cause early\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\n. It may be found during a routine\nblood test\n. Signs and symptoms may occur as the number of blood cells increases. Other\nconditions\nmay cause the same signs and symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nA feeling of pressure or fullness below the ribs on the left side.\nHeadaches.\nDouble vision or seeing dark or blind spots that come and go.\nItching all over the body, especially after being in warm or hot water.\nReddened face that looks like a blush or sunburn.\nWeakness.\nDizziness.\nWeight loss for no known reason.\nSpecial blood tests are used to diagnose polycythemia vera.\nIn addition to a\ncomplete blood count\n,\nbone marrow aspiration and biopsy\n, and\ncytogenetic analysis\n, a\nserum\nerythropoietin\ntest is used to\ndiagnose\npolycythemia vera. In this test, a sample of blood is checked for the level of erythropoietin (a\nhormone\nthat stimulates new red blood cells to be made). In polycythemia vera, the erythropoietin level would be lower than normal because the body does not need to make more red blood cells.\nPrimary Myelofibrosis\nKey Points\nPrimary myelofibrosis is a disease in which abnormal blood cells and fibers build up inside the bone marrow.\nSymptoms of primary myelofibrosis include pain below the ribs on the left side and feeling very tired.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for  primary myelofibrosis.\nPrimary myelofibrosis is a disease in which abnormal blood cells and fibers build up inside the bone marrow.\nThe\nbone marrow\nis made of\ntissues\nthat make\nblood\ncells\n(\nred blood cells\n,\nwhite blood cells\n, and\nplatelets\n) and a web of fibers that support the blood-forming tissues.  In\nprimary myelofibrosis\n(also called chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), large numbers of\nblood stem cells\nbecome blood cells that do not mature properly (\nblasts\n). The web of fibers inside the bone marrow also becomes very thick (like\nscar tissue\n) and slows the blood-forming tissue’s ability to make blood cells.  This causes the blood-forming tissues to make fewer and fewer blood cells.  In order to make up for the low number of blood cells made in the bone marrow, the\nliver\nand\nspleen\nbegin to make the blood cells.\nSymptoms of primary myelofibrosis include pain below the ribs on the left side and feeling very tired.\nPrimary myelofibrosis often does not cause early\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\n. It may be found during a routine\nblood test\n. Signs and symptoms may be caused by primary myelofibrosis or by other\nconditions\n. Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nFeeling pain or fullness below the ribs on the left side.\nFeeling full sooner than normal when eating.\nFeeling very tired.\nShortness of breath.\nEasy bruising or bleeding.\nPetechiae\n(flat, red, pinpoint spots under the skin that are caused by bleeding).\nFever\n.\nDrenching night sweats.\nWeight loss.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for  primary myelofibrosis.\nPrognosis\ndepends on the following:\nThe age of the patient.\nThe number of\nabnormal\nred blood cells and white blood cells.\nThe number of blasts in the blood.\nWhether there are certain changes in the\nchromosomes\n.\nWhether the patient has signs such as fever, drenching night sweats, or weight loss.\nEssential Thrombocythemia\nKey Points\nEssential thrombocythemia is a disease in which too many platelets are made in the bone marrow.\nPatients with essential thrombocythemia may have no signs or symptoms.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for essential thrombocythemia.\nEssential thrombocythemia is a disease in which too many platelets are made in the bone marrow.\nEssential thrombocythemia\ncauses an\nabnormal\nincrease in the number of\nplatelets\nmade in the\nblood\nand\nbone marrow\n.\nPatients with essential thrombocythemia may have no signs or symptoms.\nEssential thrombocythemia often does not cause early\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\n. It may be found during a routine\nblood test\n. Signs and symptoms may be caused by essential thrombocythemia or by other\nconditions\n.  Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nHeadache.\nBurning or tingling in the hands or feet.\nRedness and warmth of the hands or feet.\nVision or hearing problems.\nPlatelets are sticky. When there are too many platelets, they may clump together and make it hard for the blood to flow.  Clots may form in\nblood vessels\nand there may also be increased bleeding. These can cause serious health problems such as\nstroke\nor heart attack.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for essential thrombocythemia.\nPrognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe age of the patient.\nWhether the patient has signs or symptoms or other problems related to essential thrombocythemia.\nChronic Neutrophilic Leukemia\nChronic neutrophilic leukemia\nis a disease in which too many\nblood stem cells\nbecome a type of\nwhite blood cell\ncalled\nneutrophils\n. Neutrophils are\ninfection\n-fighting\nblood\ncells\nthat surround and destroy dead cells and\nforeign\nsubstances (such as\nbacteria\n). The\nspleen\nand\nliver\nmay swell because of the extra neutrophils. Chronic neutrophilic leukemia may stay the same or it may\nprogress\nquickly to\nacute leukemia\n.\nChronic Eosinophilic Leukemia\nKey Points\nChronic eosinophilic leukemia is a disease in which  too many white blood cells (eosinophils) are made in the bone marrow.\nSigns and symptoms of chronic eosinophilic leukemia include fever and feeling very tired.\nChronic eosinophilic leukemia is a disease in which  too many white blood cells (eosinophils) are made in the bone marrow.\nEosinophils\nare\nwhite blood cells\nthat react to allergens (substances that cause an\nallergic response\n) and help fight\ninfections\ncaused by certain\nparasites\n. In\nchronic eosinophilic leukemia\n, there are too many eosinophils in the\nblood\n,\nbone marrow\n, and other\ntissues\n. Chronic eosinophilic leukemia may stay the same for many years or it may\nprogress\nquickly to\nacute leukemia\n.\nSigns and symptoms of chronic eosinophilic leukemia include fever and feeling very tired.\nChronic eosinophilic leukemia may not cause early\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\n. It may be found during a routine\nblood test\n. Signs and symptoms may be caused by chronic eosinophilic leukemia or by other\nconditions\n. Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:\nFever\n.\nFeeling very tired.\nCough.\nSwelling under the skin around the eyes and lips, in the\nthroat\n, or on the hands and feet.\nMuscle pain.\nItching.\nDiarrhea\n.\nStages of Chronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\nKey Points\nThere is no standard staging system for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nThere is no standard staging system for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. There is no standard\nstaging system\nfor\nchronic myeloproliferative neoplasms\n.  It\n\t\t  is important to know the type of myeloproliferative neoplasm in order to plan treatment.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nEleven types of standard treatment are used:\nWatchful waiting\nPhlebotomy\nPlatelet apheresis\nTransfusion therapy\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nOther drug therapy\nSurgery\nImmunotherapy\nTargeted therapy\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for patients with\nchronic myeloproliferative neoplasms\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nEleven types of standard treatment are used:\nWatchful waiting\nWatchful waiting\nis closely\nmonitoring\na patient’s\ncondition\nwithout giving any treatment until\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nappear or change.\nPhlebotomy\nPhlebotomy\nis a procedure in which\nblood\nis taken from a\nvein\n. A sample of blood may be taken  for tests such as a\nCBC\nor\nblood chemistry\n. Sometimes phlebotomy is used as a treatment and blood is taken from the body to remove extra\nred blood cells\n. Phlebotomy is used in this way to treat some chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nPlatelet apheresis\nPlatelet\napheresis\nis a treatment that uses a special machine to remove platelets from the blood. Blood is taken from the patient and put through a blood\ncell\nseparator where the platelets are removed. The rest of the blood is then returned to the patient’s bloodstream.\nTransfusion therapy\nTransfusion\ntherapy\n(\nblood transfusion\n) is a method of giving red blood cells,\nwhite blood cells\n, or platelets to replace blood cells destroyed by disease or\ncancer\ntreatment.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them  from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\nfor more information.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body, such as the\nspleen\n, with cancer.\nOther drug therapy\nPrednisone\nand\ndanazol\nare drugs that may be used to treat\nanemia\nin patients with\nprimary myelofibrosis\n.\nAnagrelide\ntherapy is used to reduce the risk of\nblood clots\nin patients who have too many platelets in \ntheir blood. Low-\ndose\naspirin\nmay also be used to reduce the risk of blood clots.\nThalidomide\n,\nlenalidomide\n, and\npomalidomide\nare drugs that prevent\nblood vessels\nfrom growing into areas of\ntumor\ncells.\nErythropoietic\ngrowth factors\nare used to stimulate the\nbone marrow\nto make red blood cells.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\nfor more information.\nSurgery\nSplenectomy\n(\nsurgery\nto remove the spleen) may be done if the spleen is enlarged.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient's\nimmune system\nto fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.  This cancer treatment is a type of\nbiologic therapy\n.\nInterferon: Interferon affects the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth.\nInterferon alfa\nand\npegylated interferon alpha\nare commonly used to treat certain chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.\nTyrosine kinase inhibitor\n(TKI) therapy: TKI therapy blocks signals that cancer cells need to grow.\nRuxolitinib\nis used to treat\npolycythemia vera\nand certain types of\nmyelofibrosis\n.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms\nfor more information.\nOther types of targeted therapies are being studied in clinical trials.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nHigh doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell transplant\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a\ndonor\nand are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nEnlarge\nDonor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nInformation about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia\nSee the\nPDQ\nsummary about\nChronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment\nfor information.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done.\nGeneral information\nabout clinical trials is also available.\nTreatment of Polycythemia Vera\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nThe purpose of treatment for\npolycythemia vera\nis to reduce the number of extra\nblood\ncells\n.  Treatment of polycythemia vera may include the following:\nPhlebotomy\n.\nChemotherapy\nwith or without  phlebotomy. If the chemotherapy does not work,\ntargeted therapy\n(\nruxolitinib\n) may be given.\nImmunotherapy\n(\ninterferon alfa\nor\npegylated interferon alpha\n).\nLow-\ndose\naspirin\n.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

Less often, it forms in the soft tissue of the\ntrunk\n, arms, legs, head, neck,\nretroperitoneum\n(area in the back of the\nabdomen\nbehind the\ntissue\nthat lines the abdominal wall and covers most of the\norgans\nin the abdomen), or other areas.\nEwing sarcoma is most common in adolescents and young adults (teens through mid-20s).\nEwing sarcoma has also been called peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor, Askin tumor (Ewing sarcoma of the chest wall),\nextraosseous\nEwing sarcoma (Ewing sarcoma in tissue other than bone), and\nEwing sarcoma family of tumors\n.\nUndifferentiated small round cell sarcoma may also form in the bone or soft tissue.\nUndifferentiated\nsmall round cell sarcoma usually forms in the bones or the muscles that are attached to bones and that help the body move. There are five types of undifferentiated small round cell  sarcoma that are treated like Ewing sarcoma:\nUndifferentiated small round cell sarcoma with\nBCOR\nrearrangements.\nThis type of bone tumor usually forms in the pelvis, arms, or legs. It may spread to other parts of the body. This type of bone tumor is more common in children younger than 18 years. In this type of round cell sarcoma, the\nBCOR\ngene\nis joined to the\nCCNB3\ngene or to other genes. To\ndiagnose\nthis small round cell sarcoma, the tumor cells are checked for these gene changes.\nUndifferentiated small round cell sarcoma with\nCIC::DUX4\nrearrangements.\nThis type of soft tissue tumor usually forms in the\ntrunk\n, arms, or legs. It is most common in males and in young adults between 21 and 40 years of age. In this type of small round cell sarcoma, the\nCIC\ngene is joined to the\nDUX4\ngene. To diagnose this small round cell sarcoma, the tumor cells are checked for this gene change.\nUndifferentiated small round cell sarcoma with\nCIC::NUTM1\nrearrangements.\nThis type of soft tissue tumor usually forms in the\ncentral nervous system\n, but it can also form in the trunk. It is most common in younger patients.\nUndifferentiated small round cell sarcoma with\nEWSR1::NFATC2\nand\nFUS::NFATC2\nrearrangements.\nThis type of soft tissue tumor may be a\nbenign\ncyst\nor a\nmalignant\n(cancer) tumor. It usually forms in the arms and legs. The malignant tumor is more common in males and in adults.\nUndifferentiated small round cell sarcoma with\nEWSR1::PATZ1\nfusions.\nThis type of soft tissue tumor usually forms in the trunk and is more common in adults.\nA genetic condition may increase the risk of Ewing sarcoma and other sarcomas.\nAnything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Not every child with one or more of these risk factors will develop Ewing sarcoma or other sarcomas, and they can develop in some children who don't have any known risk factors. Children with\nFanconi anemia\nmay be at increased risk for Ewing sarcoma. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.\nSigns and symptoms of Ewing sarcoma include swelling and pain near the tumor.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by Ewing sarcoma or by other\nconditions\n.\n\t\t  Check with your child’s doctor if they have any of the following:\nA lump (which may feel soft and warm) in the arms, legs, chest, or pelvis.\nPain and/or swelling near the lump.\nFever\nfor no known reason.\nA bone that breaks for no known reason.\nTests that examine the bone and soft tissue are used to diagnose and stage Ewing sarcoma.\nProcedures that make pictures of the bones and soft tissues and nearby areas help diagnose Ewing sarcoma and show how far the\ncancer\nhas spread. The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the bones and soft tissues or to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n.\nTo plan treatment, it is important to know whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and\nstage\nEwing sarcoma are usually done at the same time.\nIn addition to asking about your child's\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your child's doctor may perform the following tests and procedures to diagnose or stage Ewing sarcoma:\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the area where the tumor formed. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nEnlarge\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the area where the tumor formed or the chest, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nEnlarge\nComputed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.\nPET-CT scan\n: A procedure that combines the pictures from a\nPET scan\nand a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself.\nEnlarge\nPositron emission tomography (PET) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the PET scanner. The head rest and white strap help the child lie still.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the child's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body.  Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nBone scan\n: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of\nradioactive\nmaterial is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.\nEnlarge\nBone scan.  A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the child's vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive material collects in the bones. As the child lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen.\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\n: The removal of\nbone marrow\nand a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone. Samples are removed from both hipbones. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow and bone under a\nmicroscope\nto see if the cancer has spread.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.\nX-ray\n: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body, such as the chest or the area where the tumor formed.\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\n: A procedure in which a sample of\nblood\nis drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of\nred blood cells\n,\nwhite blood cells\n, and\nplatelets\n.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries\noxygen\n) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as\nlactate dehydrogenase\n(LDH), released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nA biopsy is done to diagnose Ewing sarcoma.\nTissue samples are removed during a biopsy so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. It is helpful if the biopsy is done at the same center where treatment will be given. The following types of biopsy are used to diagnose Ewing sarcoma:\nIncisional biopsy\n: For an incisional biopsy, a sample of tissue is removed through an\nincision\nin the skin.\nNeedle biopsy\n: For this biopsy, a sample of tissue is removed using a needle.\nThe\nspecialists\n(pathologist,\nradiation oncologist\n, and\nsurgeon\n) who will treat the patient usually work together to decide the best site to place the needle or biopsy incision. The selection of the biopsy site is important. A biopsy site that is not properly selected may result in more extensive\nsurgery\nto remove the tumor or a larger area that is treated with\nradiation therapy\n.\nIf there is a chance that the cancer has spread to nearby\nlymph nodes\n, one or more lymph nodes may be removed and checked for signs of cancer.\nThe following tests may be done on the tissue that is removed:\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nImmunohistochemistry\n: A laboratory test that uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nFlow cytometry\n: A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of the cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor (or other)\nmarkers\non the cell surface. The cells from a sample of a patient's blood, bone marrow, or other tissue are stained with a fluorescent dye, placed in a\nfluid\n, and then passed one at a time through a beam of light. The test results are based on how the cells that were stained with the fluorescent dye react to the beam of light.\nMolecular test\n: A laboratory test to check for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules in a sample of tissue, blood, or other body fluid. A molecular test may be done with other procedures, such as biopsies, to help diagnose some types of cancer. Molecular tests check for certain gene or chromosome changes that occur in some Ewing sarcomas.\nReverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (\nRT–PCR\n) test\n: A laboratory test in which the amount of a\ngenetic\nsubstance called\nmRNA\nmade by a specific gene is measured. An enzyme called reverse transcriptase is used to convert a specific piece of\nRNA\ninto a matching piece of\nDNA\n, which can be amplified (made in large numbers) by another enzyme called DNA polymerase. The amplified DNA copies help tell whether a specific mRNA is being made by a gene. RT–PCR can be used to check the activation of certain genes that may indicate the presence of cancer cells. This test may be used to look for certain changes in a gene or\nchromosome\n, which may help diagnose cancer.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).\nThe factors that affect\nprognosis\nare different before and after treatment.\nBefore any treatment is given, prognosis depends on:\nWhere in the body the tumor started.\nWhether the tumor formed in the bone or in soft tissue.\nWhether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or distant parts of the body.\nHow large the tumor is when the tumor is diagnosed.\nWhether the LDH level in the blood is higher than normal.\nWhether the tumor has certain gene changes.\nWhether tumor\nDNA\nhas been found in the blood.\nThe patient's age.\nThe patient's sex.\nWhether the patient has had treatment for a different  cancer.\nWhether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nAfter treatment is given, prognosis is affected by:\nWhether the tumor was completely removed by surgery.\nWhether the tumor\nresponded\nto\nchemotherapy\nor radiation therapy.\nIf the cancer recurs after initial treatment, prognosis depends on:\nWhether the cancer came back more than two years after the initial treatment.\nWhether the cancer came back where it first formed and in other parts of the body, or whether the cancer came back in only one site.\nStages of Ewing Sarcoma\nKey Points\nAfter Ewing sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.\nEwing sarcoma is described as localized, metastatic, or recurrent.\nLocalized Ewing sarcoma\nMetastatic Ewing sarcoma\nRecurrent Ewing sarcoma\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nAfter Ewing sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread from where it began to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. There is no standard\nstaging system\nfor\nEwing sarcoma\n. The results of the\ntests and procedures\ndone to\ndiagnose\nand\nstage\nEwing sarcoma are used to help make decisions about treatment.  Treatment is based on whether the cancer is\nlocalized\n,\nmetastatic\n, or\nrecurrent\n.\nEwing sarcoma is described as localized, metastatic, or recurrent.\nLocalized Ewing sarcoma\nThe\ncancer\nis found in  the bone or\nsoft tissue\nwhere it began and may have  spread to nearby\ntissue\n, including nearby\nlymph nodes\n.\nMetastatic Ewing sarcoma\nThe\ncancer\nhas spread from the bone or soft tissue where it began to other parts of the body. In Ewing tumor of bone, the cancer most often spreads to the\nlung\n, other bones, and\nbone marrow\n.\nRecurrent Ewing sarcoma\nThe cancer has\nrecurred\n(come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the bone or soft tissue where it began or in another part of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the\nprimary tumor\n. For example, if  Ewing sarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually Ewing sarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic Ewing sarcoma, not\nlung cancer\n.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for children with Ewing sarcoma.\nChildren with Ewing sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of            health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nFour types of treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nSurgery\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nImmunotherapy\nTreatment for Ewing sarcoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for children with Ewing sarcoma.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for children with\nEwing sarcoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.\nBecause cancer in children and adolescents is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nChildren with Ewing sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of            health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nTreatment will be overseen by a\npediatric oncologist\n, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other\nhealth care providers\nwho are experts in treating children with Ewing sarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of\nmedicine\n. These may include the following\nspecialists\n:\nPediatrician\n.\nSurgical oncologist\nor orthopedic\noncologist\n.\nRadiation oncologist\n.\nPediatric nurse specialist\n.\nSocial worker\n.\nRehabilitation specialist\n.\nPsychologist\n.\nFour types of treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer\ncells\n, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nCombination chemotherapy\nis treatment using more than one anticancer drug.\nSystemic combination chemotherapy is part of the treatment for all patients with Ewing\ntumors\n. It is often the first treatment given and lasts for about 6 to 12 months. Chemotherapy is often given to shrink the tumor before\nsurgery\nor\nradiation therapy\nand to kill any tumor cells that may have spread to other parts of the body.\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nRadiation therapy is used when the tumor cannot be removed by surgery or when surgery to remove the tumor will affect important body functions or the way the child will look. It may be used to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of\ntissue\nthat needs to be removed during surgery. It may also be used to treat any tumor that remains after surgery and tumors that have spread to other parts of the body.\nRadiation therapy may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms caused by the tumor in the bone.\nSurgery\nSurgery is usually done to remove cancer that is left after chemotherapy or radiation therapy. When possible, the whole tumor is removed by surgery.\nTissue\nand bone that are removed may be replaced with a\ngraft\n, which uses tissue and bone taken from another part of the patient's body or a\ndonor\n. Sometimes an\nimplant\n, such as artificial bone, is used.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue\nHigh\ndoses\nof chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including\nblood\n-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell transplant\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. Chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is used to treat\nlocalized\nand\nrecurrent\nEwing sarcoma.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nhelps a person's immune system fight cancer. Types of immunotherapy include:\nCAR T-cell therapy\n:\nThis treatment changes the patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special\nreceptors\nare added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied to treat recurrent Ewing sarcoma.\nEnlarge\nCAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient’s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient’s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.\nTreatment for Ewing sarcoma may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSide effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called\nlate effects\n. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:\nPhysical problems.\nChanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.\nSecond cancers\n(new types of cancer). Patients treated for Ewing sarcoma have an increased risk of\nacute myeloid leukemia\nand\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\n. There is also an increased risk of\nsarcoma\nin the area treated with radiation therapy.\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. For more information, see\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\n.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Localized Ewing Sarcoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nStandard treatments\nfor newly\ndiagnosed\nlocalized\nEwing sarcoma\ninclude:\nChemotherapy\n.\nSurgery\nand/or\nradiation therapy\n.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy\nwith\nstem cell rescue\nwith the patient's own\ncells\n.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "question": "What is the outlook for Ewing Sarcoma ?",
        "answer": "The outlook for Ewing sarcoma depends on various factors such as whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or distant parts of the body, where in the body the tumor started, whether the tumor formed in bone or soft tissue, how large the tumor is at diagnosis, whether the LDH level in the blood is higher than normal, whether the tumor has certain gene changes, whether the child is younger than 15 years, the patient's gender, whether the child has had treatment for a different cancer before Ewing sarcoma, and whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back). After treatment, prognosis is affected by whether the tumor was completely removed by surgery and whether it responds to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. If the cancer recurs after initial treatment, the outlook depends on whether it came back more than two years after the initial treatment, where in the body the tumor came back, and the type of initial treatment given. In fact, Ewing sarcoma is curable in most patients with early-stage disease, and the prognosis is generally favorable for those who receive aggressive multimodal therapy.",

        "context": "Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors\nKey Points\nChildhood kidney tumors are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the kidney.\nThere are many types of childhood kidney tumors.\nWilms Tumor\nRenal Cell Cancer (RCC)\nRhabdoid Tumor of the Kidney\nClear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney\nCongenital Mesoblastic Nephroma\nEwing Sarcoma of the Kidney\nPrimary Renal Myoepithelial Carcinoma\nCystic Partially Differentiated Nephroblastoma\nMultilocular Cystic Nephroma\nPrimary Renal Synovial Sarcoma\nAnaplastic Sarcoma of the Kidney\nNephroblastomatosis is not cancer but may become Wilms tumor.\nHaving certain genetic syndromes,  other conditions, or environmental exposures can  increase the risk of Wilms tumor.\nTests are used to screen for Wilms tumor.\nHaving certain conditions may increase the risk of renal cell cancer.\nTreatment for Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may include genetic counseling.\nSigns of Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors  include a lump in the abdomen and blood in the urine.\nTests that examine the kidney and the blood are used to diagnose Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nChildhood kidney tumors are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the kidney.\nThere are two\nkidneys\n, one on each side of the\nspine\n, above the waist. Tiny tubules in the kidneys\nfilter\nand clean the\nblood\n. They take out waste products and make\nurine\n. The urine passes from each kidney through a long tube called a\nureter\ninto the\nbladder\n. The bladder holds the urine until it passes through the\nurethra\nand leaves the body.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the urinary system showing the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The inside of the left kidney shows the renal pelvis. An inset shows the renal tubules and urine. Also shown is the spine and adrenal glands. Urine is made in the renal tubules and collects in the renal pelvis of each kidney. The urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters to the bladder. The urine is stored in the bladder until it leaves the body through the urethra.\nThere are many types of childhood kidney tumors.\nWilms Tumor\nIn\nWilms tumor\n, one or more\ntumors\nmay be found in one or both kidneys. Wilms tumor may spread to the\nlungs\n,\nliver\n, bone, brain, or nearby\nlymph nodes\n. In children and adolescents younger than 15 years old, most\nkidney cancers\nare Wilms tumors.\nRenal Cell Cancer (RCC)\nRenal cell cancer\nis rare in children  and adolescents younger than 15 years old. It is much more common in adolescents between 15 and 19 years old. Children and adolescents are more likely to be\ndiagnosed\nwith a large renal cell tumor or cancer that has  spread. Renal cell cancers may spread to the lungs, liver, bone, or lymph nodes. Renal cell cancer may also be called renal cell carcinoma.\nRhabdoid Tumor of the Kidney\nRhabdoid tumor of the kidney\nis a type of kidney cancer that occurs mostly in infants and young children. It is often\nadvanced\nat the time of diagnosis. Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney grows and spreads quickly, often  to the lungs or  brain.\nChildren with a certain change in the\nSMARCB1\ngene\ncan also have tumors grow in the kidney, brain, or\nsoft tissues\n. These children are checked regularly to see if a rhabdoid tumor has formed in the kidney or the brain:\nChildren from birth or\ndiagnosis\nto 5 years old have an\nMRI\nof the brain and\nspine\nand an\nultrasound of the abdomen\nevery 3 months.\nClear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney\nClear cell sarcoma of the kidney\nis an uncommon kidney  cancer that may  spread to the bone, lungs, brain, liver, or soft tissue.  It occurs most often before age 3 years.  It may\nrecur\n(come back) up to 14 years after treatment, often in the brain or lung.\nCongenital Mesoblastic Nephroma\nCongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nis a tumor of the kidney that is often diagnosed during the first year of life or before birth. It is the most common kidney tumor found in infants younger than 6 months old and is found more often in males than in females. It can usually be\ncured\n.\nEwing Sarcoma of the Kidney\nEwing sarcoma\n(previously called\nneuroepithelial\ntumor) of the kidney is rare and usually occurs in young adults. This cancer grows and spreads to other parts of the body quickly.\nPrimary Renal Myoepithelial Carcinoma\nPrimary renal myoepithelial carcinoma\nis a rare type of\ncancer\nthat usually affects soft tissues, but sometimes forms in the internal\norgans\n(such as the kidney).  This type of cancer grows and spreads quickly.\nCystic Partially Differentiated Nephroblastoma\nCystic\npartially\ndifferentiated\nnephroblastoma is a very rare type of Wilms tumor  made up     of cysts.\nMultilocular Cystic Nephroma\nMultilocular cystic nephromas are\nbenign\ntumors made up of cysts and are most common in infants, young children, and adult women. These tumors can occur in one or both kidneys.\nChildren with this type of tumor also may have\npleuropulmonary blastoma\n, so\nimaging tests\nthat check the lungs for cysts or\nsolid tumors\nare done. Since multilocular cystic nephroma may be an\ninherited\ncondition\n,\ngenetic counseling\nand\ngenetic testing\nmay be considered. See the PDQ summary about\nChildhood Pleuropulmonary Blastoma Treatment\nfor more information.\nPrimary Renal Synovial Sarcoma\nPrimary\nrenal synovial sarcoma is a cyst-like tumor of the kidney and is most common in young adults. These tumors grow and spread quickly.\nAnaplastic Sarcoma of the Kidney\nAnaplastic\nsarcoma\nof the kidney is a rare tumor that is most common in children or adolescents younger than 15 years of age. Anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney often spreads to the lungs, liver, or bones. Imaging tests that check the lungs for cysts or solid tumors may be done. Since anaplastic sarcoma may be  an inherited condition, genetic counseling and genetic testing may be considered.\nNephroblastomatosis is not cancer but may become Wilms tumor.\nSometimes, after the kidneys form in the\nfetus\n,\nabnormal\ngroups of   kidney cells remain in one or both kidneys.  In nephroblastomatosis (\ndiffuse hyperplastic perilobar nephroblastomatosis\n), these abnormal groups of cells may grow in many places inside the kidney  or make a thick layer around the  kidney.  When these groups of abnormal cells are found  in a kidney after it was removed for Wilms tumor, the child has an increased risk of Wilms tumor in the other kidney. Frequent\nfollow-up\ntesting is important at least every 3 months, for at least 7 years after the child is     diagnosed or treated.\nHaving certain genetic syndromes,  other conditions, or environmental exposures can  increase the risk of Wilms tumor.\nAnything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.\nWilms tumor may be part of a\ngenetic\nsyndrome\nthat affects  growth or development. A genetic syndrome is a set of\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nor conditions that occur together and is caused by certain changes in the genes. Certain conditions or\nenvironmental exposures\ncan also increase a child's risk of developing Wilms tumor. The following have been linked to Wilms tumor:\nWAGR syndrome\n(Wilms tumor,\naniridia\n, abnormal\ngenitourinary system\n, and mental disability).\nDenys-Drash syndrome\n(abnormal genitourinary system).\nFrasier syndrome (abnormal genitourinary system).\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome\n(abnormally large growth of one or more body parts, large tongue, umbilical\nhernia\nat birth, and abnormal genitourinary system).\nA\nfamily history\nof Wilms tumor.\nAniridia (part or all of the\niris\n, the colored part of the eye, is missing).\nIsolated\nhemihyperplasia\n(abnormally large growth of one or more body parts).\nUrinary tract\nproblems such as\ncryptorchidism\nor\nhypospadias\n.\nThe child's mother being exposed to\npesticides\nwhile she was\npregnant\n.\nTests are used to screen for Wilms tumor.\nScreening\ntests are done in children with an increased risk of Wilms tumor. These tests may help find cancer early and decrease the chance of dying from cancer.\nIn general, children with an increased risk of Wilms tumor  should be screened for Wilms tumor every 3 months until they are at least 8 years old. An ultrasound test of the abdomen is usually used for screening. Small Wilms tumors may be found and removed before symptoms occur.\nChildren with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or hemihyperplasia are also screened for liver and\nadrenal\ntumors that are linked to these genetic syndromes. A test to check the\nalpha-fetoprotein\n(AFP) level in the blood and an ultrasound of the abdomen are done until the child is 4 years old. An ultrasound of the kidneys is done between the ages of 4 and 7 years old. A\nphysical exam\nby a\nspecialist\n(\ngeneticist\nor\npediatric oncologist\n) is done two times each year. In children with certain gene changes, a different schedule for ultrasound of the abdomen may be used.\nChildren with aniridia and a certain gene change are screened for Wilms tumor every 3 months until they are 8 years old. An ultrasound test of the abdomen is used for screening.\nSome children develop Wilms tumor in both kidneys. These often appear   when Wilms tumor is first diagnosed, but Wilms tumor may also occur in the second kidney after the child is successfully  treated for Wilms tumor in one kidney. Children with an increased risk of a second Wilms tumor in the other kidney should be screened for Wilms tumor every 3 months for up to 8 years. An ultrasound test of the abdomen may be used for screening.\nHaving certain conditions may increase the risk of renal cell cancer.\nRenal cell cancer may be related to the following conditions:\nVon Hippel-Lindau disease\n(an\ninherited\ncondition that causes abnormal growth of\nblood vessels\n).  Children with Von Hippel-Lindau disease should be   checked yearly for renal cell cancer with an  ultrasound of the abdomen or an MRI      (magnetic resonance imaging)   beginning at age 8 to 11 years.\nTuberous sclerosis\n(an inherited disease marked by noncancerous fatty cysts in the kidney).\nFamilial\nrenal cell cancer (an inherited condition that occurs when certain changes in the genes that cause kidney cancer are passed down from the parent to the child).\nRenal medullary cancer (a  rare kidney cancer that grows and spreads quickly).\nHereditary leiomyomatosis\n(an inherited\ndisorder\nthat increases the risk of having cancer of the kidney, skin, and\nuterus\n).\nPrior\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nfor a\nchildhood cancer\n, such as\nneuroblastoma\n, soft tissue sarcoma,\nleukemia\n, or Wilms tumor may also increase the risk of renal cell cancer.  See the\nSecond Cancers\nsection in the PDQ summary about\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\nfor more information.\nTreatment for Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may include genetic counseling.\nGenetic counseling\n(a discussion with a trained professional about genetic diseases and whether\ngenetic testing\nis needed) may be done if the child has one of the following syndromes or conditions:\nA\ngenetic syndrome or condition that increases the risk of Wilms tumor\n.\nAn\ninherited condition that increases the risk of renal cell cancer\n.\nRhabdoid tumor\nof the kidney.\nMultilocular cystic nephroma.\nAnaplastic sarcoma of the kidney.\nSigns of Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors  include a lump in the abdomen and blood in the urine.\nSometimes childhood kidney tumors do not cause signs and symptoms and the parent finds a\nmass\nin the abdomen by chance or the mass is found during a well-child health check-up. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by kidney tumors or by other conditions.  Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:\nA lump, swelling, or pain in the abdomen.\nBlood in the urine.\nHigh blood pressure\n(headache, feeling very tired, chest pain, or  trouble seeing or breathing).\nHypercalcemia\n(loss of\nappetite\n,\nnausea\nand\nvomiting\n, weakness, or feeling very tired).\nFever\nfor no known reason.\nLoss of appetite.\nWeight loss for no known reason.\nWilms tumor that has spread to the lungs or liver may cause the following signs and symptoms:\nCough.\nBlood in the\nsputum\n.\nTrouble breathing.\nPain in the abdomen.\nTests that examine the kidney and the blood are used to diagnose Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nComplete blood\n\t\t\t count\n(CBC)\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and\n\t\t\t checked for the following:\nThe number of\nred blood cells\n,\nwhite blood cells\n, and\nplatelets\n.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries\noxygen\n) in\n\t\t\t\t  the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood\n\t\t\t\t  cells.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. This test is done to check how well the liver and kidneys are working.\nRenal function test\n: A procedure in which blood or urine samples are checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood or urine by the kidneys. A higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign that the kidneys are not working as they should.\nUrinalysis\n: A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, blood, and\nbacteria\n.\nUltrasound exam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. An ultrasound of the abdomen is done to diagnose a kidney tumor.\nEnlarge\nAbdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound transducer connected to a computer is pressed against the skin of the abdomen. The transducer bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, and\npelvis\n, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nis\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nEnlarge\nComputed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.\nMRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the  abdomen. A substance called\ngadolinium\nis injected into  a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nEnlarge\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.\nX-ray\n: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body, such as the chest and abdomen.\nPET-CT scan\n: A procedure that combines the pictures from a\npositron emission tomography (PET) scan\nand a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself. A PET scan is a procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor cells in the body. A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nBiopsy\n: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. The decision of whether to do a biopsy is based on the following:\nThe size of the tumor.\nThe\nstage\nof the cancer. If  the  tumor appears to be\nresectable\nor\nstage I\nor\nstage II Wilms tumor\n, a biopsy is not done to avoid tumor cells being  spread during the procedure.\nWhether cancer is in one or both kidneys.\nWhether imaging tests clearly show the cancer.\nWhether the patient is in a\nclinical trial\n.\nA biopsy may be done before any treatment is given, after chemotherapy to shrink the tumor, or after surgery to remove the tumor.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options for Wilms tumor depend on the following:\nHow different the tumor cells are from normal kidney cells when looked at under a microscope.\nThe stage of the cancer.\nThe type of tumor.\nThe age of the child.\nWhether the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.\nWhether there are certain changes in\nchromosomes\nor genes.\nWhether the cancer  has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).\nThe prognosis for renal cell cancer depends on the following:\nThe stage of the cancer.\nWhether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.\nThe prognosis for rhabdoid tumor of the kidney depends on the following:\nThe age of the child at the time of diagnosis.\nThe stage of the cancer.\nWhether the cancer has spread to the brain or\nspinal cord\n.\nThe prognosis for clear cell sarcoma of the kidney depends on the following:\nThe age of the child at the time of diagnosis.\nThe stage of the cancer.\nStages of Wilms Tumor\nKey Points\nWilms tumors are  staged during surgery and with imaging tests.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nIn addition to the stages, Wilms tumors are described by their histology.\nThe following stages are used for both favorable      histology and anaplastic Wilms tumors:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nStage V (bilateral)\nSometimes Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors come back after treatment.\nWilms tumors are  staged during surgery and with imaging tests.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread outside of the\nkidney\nto other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. The results of the tests and procedures done to\ndiagnose\nand stage\nWilms tumor\nare used to help make decisions about treatment.\nThere is no staging for the other types of childhood kidney\ntumors\n. The treatment of these tumors depends on the tumor type.\nThe following tests may be done to see if cancer has spread to other places in the body:\nLymph node biopsy\n: The removal of all or part of a\nlymph node\nin the\nabdomen\n. A\npathologist\nviews the lymph node\ntissue\nunder a\nmicroscope\nto check for cancer\ncells\n. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy or lymph node dissection.\nLiver function test\n: A procedure in which a\nblood\nsample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the\nliver\n. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign  that the liver is not working as it should.\nX-ray\nof the chest and bones\n: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body, such as the chest.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen,\npelvis\n, chest, and brain, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nis\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the\norgans\nor\ntissues\nshow up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nPET-CT scan\n: A procedure that combines the pictures from a\npositron emission tomography (PET) scan\nand a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both\nscans\nare combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself. A PET scan is a procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor\ncells in the body. A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\nabdomen\n,\npelvis\n, and brain. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nBone scan\n: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing\ncells\n, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of\nradioactive\nmaterial is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a\nscanner\n.\nEnlarge\nBone scan.  A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the child's vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive material collects in the bones. As the child lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen.\nUltrasound\nexam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. An ultrasound of the major heart\nvessels\nis done to stage\nWilms tumor\n.\nCystoscopy\n: A procedure to look inside the\nbladder\nand\nurethra\nto check for\nabnormal\nareas.  A\ncystoscope\nis inserted through the urethra into the bladder.  A cystoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a\nlens\nfor viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  Wilms tumor spreads to the\nlung\n, the cancer cells in the lung are actually Wilms tumor cells. The disease is metastatic Wilms tumor, not lung cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nIn addition to the stages, Wilms tumors are described by their histology.\nThe\nhistology\n(how the cells look under a microscope) of the\ntumor\naffects the\nprognosis\nand     the treatment of Wilms tumor. The histology may be favorable or\nanaplastic\n(unfavorable). Tumors with a favorable histology have a better prognosis and\nrespond\nbetter to\nchemotherapy\nthan anaplastic tumors. Tumor cells that are anaplastic divide quickly and under a microscope do not look like the type of cells they came from. Anaplastic tumors are harder to treat with chemotherapy than other Wilms tumors at the same stage.\nThe following stages are used for both favorable      histology and anaplastic Wilms tumors:\nStage I\nIn\nstage I\n, the\ntumor\nwas completely removed by\nsurgery\nand all of the following are true:\nCancer\nwas found only in the\nkidney\nand did not spread to\nblood vessels\nin the renal\nsinus\n(the part of the kidney where it joins the\nureter\n) or to the\nlymph nodes\n.\nNo cancer\ncells\nwere found at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed.\nThe outer layer of the kidney did not break open.\nThe tumor did not break open.\nA\nbiopsy\nwas not done before the tumor was removed.\nStage II\nIn\nstage II\n, the\ntumor\nwas completely removed by\nsurgery\nand no\ncancer\ncells\nwere found at the edges of the area where the cancer was removed. Cancer has not spread to\nlymph nodes\n. Before the tumor was removed, one of the following was  true:\nCancer had spread  to the renal\nsinus\n(the part of the\nkidney\nwhere it joins the\nureter\n).\nCancer had spread to\nblood vessels\noutside the area of the kidney where\nurine\nis made, such as the renal sinus.\nStage III\nIn\nstage III\n,\ncancer\nremains in the\nabdomen\nafter\nsurgery\nand at least one of the  following is true:\nCancer has spread to\nlymph nodes\nin the abdomen or\npelvis\n(the part of the body between the hips).\nCancer has spread to or through the surface of the\nperitoneum\n(the\ntissue\nthat lines the\nabdominal\ncavity\nand covers most\norgans\nin the abdomen).\nA biopsy of the\ntumor\nwas done before it was removed.\nThe tumor broke open before or during surgery to remove it.\nThe tumor was removed in more than one piece.\nCancer\ncells\nare found at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed.\nThe entire tumor could not be removed because important organs or tissues in the body would be damaged.\nStage IV\nIn\nstage IV\n,\ncancer\nhas spread through the\nblood\nto\norgans\nsuch as the\nlungs\n,\nliver\n, bone, or brain, or to\nlymph nodes\noutside the\nabdomen\nand\npelvis\n.\nStage V (bilateral)\nIn\nstage V\n(\nbilateral\n) Wilms tumor,\ncancer\ncells\nare found in both\nkidneys\nwhen the cancer is first\ndiagnosed\n. The cancer in each kidney is staged separately as stage I, II, III, or IV.\nSometimes Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors come back after treatment.\nChildhood Wilms tumor may\nrecur\n(come back) in the lungs, abdomen, liver, or other places in the body.\nChildhood\nclear cell sarcoma of the kidney\nmay recur in the brain, lungs, or other places in the body.\nChildhood\ncongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nmay recur in the kidneys or in other places in the body.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.\nChildren with Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors  should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nSix types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue\nTargeted therapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for children with\nWilms\nand other childhood\nkidney\ntumors\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.\nBecause cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.     Some clinical trials  are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nChildren with Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors  should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nYour child's treatment will be overseen by a\npediatric oncologist\n, a doctor who\nspecializes\nin treating children with cancer.  The pediatric oncologist works with other\npediatric\nhealth care providers\nwho are experts in treating  children with Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors  and who specialize in certain areas of\nmedicine\n.  These may include the following specialists:\nPediatrician\n.\nPediatric surgeon\nor\nurologist\n.\nRadiation oncologist\n.\nRehabilitation specialist\n.\nPediatric nurse  specialist\n.\nSocial worker\n.\nSix types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nTwo types of\nsurgery\nare used to treat kidney tumors:\nNephrectomy\n: Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors are usually treated with nephrectomy (surgery to remove the whole kidney). Nearby\nlymph nodes\nmay also be removed and checked for\nsigns\nof cancer. Sometimes a kidney\ntransplant\n(surgery to remove the kidney and replace it with a kidney from a\ndonor\n) is done when the cancer is in both kidneys and the kidneys are not working well.\nPartial nephrectomy\n: If cancer is found in both kidneys or is likely to spread to both kidneys, surgery  may include a partial nephrectomy (removal of the cancer in the kidney and a small amount of normal\ntissue\naround it). Partial nephrectomy is done to  keep as much of the kidney working as possible. A partial nephrectomy is also called renal-sparing surgery.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or\nradiation therapy\nafter surgery to kill any cancer\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given after the surgery,      to lower the risk that the cancer  will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n. Sometimes, a\nsecond-look surgery\nis done to see if cancer remains after chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\nSometimes the tumor cannot be removed by surgery for one of the following reasons:\nThe tumor is too close to important\norgans\nor\nblood vessels\n.\nThe tumor is too large to remove.\nThe cancer is in both kidneys, unless the tumors are very small.\nThere is a\nblood clot\nin the vessels near the\nliver\n.\nThe patient has trouble breathing because cancer has spread to the\nlungs\n.\nIn this case, a\nbiopsy\nis done first. Then chemotherapy is given to reduce the size of the tumor before surgery, in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible and lessen problems after surgery. This is called\nneoadjuvant\nchemotherapy. Radiation therapy is given after surgery.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nExternal radiation therapy is used to treat Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nCombination chemotherapy\nis treatment using two or more anticancer drugs.\nSystemic chemotherapy is used to treat Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.\nSometimes chemotherapy is given to reduce the size of the tumor before surgery, in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible and lessen problems after surgery. This is called\nneoadjuvant\nchemotherapy.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Cancers\nfor more information.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient's\nimmune system\nto fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.  This cancer treatment is a type of\nbiologic therapy\n.\nInterferon\nand\ninterleukin-2\n(IL-2) are types of immunotherapy used to treat childhood\nrenal cell cancer\n. Interferon may slow tumor growth and may help kill the cancer cells. IL-2 boosts the growth and activity of many immune cells, especially\nlymphocytes\n(a type of\nwhite blood cell\n). Lymphocytes can attack and kill cancer cells.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue\nHigh doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including\nblood\n-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell rescue\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue may be used to treat\nrhabdoid tumor\nof the kidney or\nrecurrent\nWilms tumor.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.  Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Targeted therapy used to treat childhood kidney tumors may include the following:\nTyrosine kinase inhibitors\n: This targeted therapy blocks signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide.\nLarotrectinib\nand\nentrectinib\nmay be used to treat\ncongenital mesoblastic nephroma\nwith a certain\ngene\nchange that cannot be removed by surgery, has spread to other parts of the body, or has continued to grow during treatment. This combination is also being studied to treat congenital mesoblastic nephroma that has come back after treatment.\nSunitinib\nor\ncabozantinib\nmay be used to treat renal cell carcinoma.\nAxitinib\nis being studied in combination with a monoclonal antibody (\nnivolumab\n) to treat renal cell carcinoma that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body.\nHistone methyltransferase inhibitors\n: This targeted therapy may keep the cancer cells from growing and dividing.\nTazemetostat\nis being studied to treat\nrhabdoid tumor of the kidney\nthat does not respond or has come back after treatment.\nMonoclonal antibody\ntherapy\n: Monoclonal antibodies are\nimmune system\nproteins\nmade in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these\nantibodies\ncan attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by\ninfusion\n. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or\nradioactive\nmaterial directly to cancer cells.\nNivolumab\nor a combination of nivolumab and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (axitinib) are being studied to treat renal cell carcinoma that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nOther targeted therapies are being studied for the treatment of childhood kidney tumors that have\nrecurred\n(come back).\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nInformation about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSide effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called\nlate effects\n. Late effects of cancer  treatment may include the following:\nPhysical problems, such as problems with the heart, the kidney, or during\npregnancy\n.\nInfertility\n.\nChanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.\nSecond cancers\n(new types of cancer), such as\nleukemias\n, cancer of the\ngastrointestinal tract\n, or\nbreast cancer\n.\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the\nPDQ\nsummary about\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\nfor more information).\nClinical trials are being done to find out if lower\ndoses\nof\nchemotherapy\nand\nradiation\ncan be used to lessen the late effects of treatment without changing how well the treatment works.\nMonitoring\nfor\nlate effects\ninvolving the kidneys in  patients with Wilms tumor and related  conditions includes the following:\nChildren with\nWAGR syndrome\nare monitored throughout their lives because they are at increased risk of\ndeveloping\nhypertension\nand kidney disease.\nChildren with Wilms tumor and\nabnormal\ngenitourinary system\nare monitored  because they are  at increased risk of late kidney failure.\nPatients with\nWilms tumor and\naniridia\nwithout abnormal genitourinary system are at lower\nrisk but are monitored for  kidney disease or\nkidney failure\n.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment Options for Wilms Tumor\nIn This Section\nStage I Wilms Tumor\nStage II Wilms Tumor\nStage III Wilms Tumor\nStage IV Wilms Tumor\nStage V Wilms Tumor and patients at high risk of developing bilateral Wilms tumor\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nStage I Wilms Tumor\nTreatment of\nstage I Wilms tumor\nwith favorable\nhistology\nmay include:\nNephrectomy\nwith removal of\nlymph nodes\n, followed by\ncombination chemotherapy\n.\nNephrectomy with removal of lymph nodes.\nTreatment of stage I\nanaplastic\nWilms tumor may include:\nNephrectomy with   removal of lymph nodes, followed by combination chemotherapy   and\nradiation therapy\nto the flank area (either side of the body between the ribs and hipbone).\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "question": "What are the stages of Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors ?",
        "answer": "The stages of Wilms Tumor and other childhood kidney tumors are as follows:\n1. Stage I: The tumor is completely removed by surgery, and it has not spread to blood vessels in the renal sinus or lymph nodes. The outer layer of the kidney did not break open, and the tumor did not break open. No cancer cells were found at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed, and a biopsy was not done before the tumor was removed.\n2. Stage II: The tumor is completely removed by surgery, and no cancer cells were found at the edges of the area where the cancer was removed. Cancer has not spread to lymph nodes, but it may have spread to the renal sinus or blood vessels outside the area of the kidney where urine is made before the tumor was removed.\n3. Stage III: Cancer remains in the abdomen after surgery, and it may have spread to lymph nodes in the abdomen or pelvis, or to the surface of the peritoneum (the layer of tissue that lines the abdominal cavity). The tumor may have been removed in more than one piece, or cancer cells may be found at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed. The entire tumor could not be removed without damaging important organs or tissues in the body.\n4. Stage IV: Cancer has spread through the blood to organs such as the lungs, liver, bone, or brain, or to lymph nodes outside of the abdomen and pelvis.\n5. Stage V: Cancer cells are found in both kidneys when the cancer is first diagnosed.",

        "context": "Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Screening (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nWhat is screening?\nScreening\nis  looking for\ncancer\nbefore a person has any\nsymptoms\n. This can help find\n\t\tcancer at an early\nstage\n. When\nabnormal\ntissue\nor cancer is found early, it may\n\t\tbe easier to treat. By the time symptoms  appear, cancer may have begun\n\t\tto  spread.\nScientists\nare trying to better understand which\n\t\tpeople are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things\n\t\twe do and the things around us to see if they cause  cancer. This\n\t\tinformation helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which\n\t\tscreening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done.\nIt is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily\n\t\tthink you have cancer if he or she suggests a  screening test. Screening\n\t\ttests are given when you  have no cancer symptoms.\nIf a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called\ndiagnostic tests\n.\nGeneral Information About Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers\nKey Points\nOvarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.\nIn the United States, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women.\nDifferent factors increase or decrease the risk of getting ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers.\nOvarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.\nThe\novaries\nare a pair\n\t\t  of\norgans\nin the female\nreproductive\n\t\t  system\n. They are located in the\npelvis\n, one on each side of the\nuterus\n(the hollow, pear-shaped\n\t\t  organ where a\nfetus\ngrows). Each\n\t\t  ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries produce eggs and\n\t\t  female\nhormones\n(\nchemicals\nthat\n\t\t  control the way certain\ncells\nor\n\t\t  organs function).\nThe\nfallopian tubes\nare a pair of long, slender tubes, one on each side of the uterus. Eggs pass from the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus.\nCancer\nsometimes begins at the end of the fallopian tube near the ovary and spreads to the ovary.\nThe\nperitoneum\nis the\ntissue\nthat lines the\nabdominal\nwall and covers organs in the\nabdomen\n.\nPrimary peritoneal cancer\nis cancer that forms in the peritoneum and has not spread there from another part of the body. Cancer sometimes begins in the peritoneum and spreads to the ovary.\nOvarian epithelial cancer\n,\nfallopian tube cancer\n, and primary peritoneal cancer form in the same type of tissue. Studies of\nscreening\ntests look at these cancers together.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium.\nFor more information about\novarian\n, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers, see the following:\nOvarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Prevention\nGenetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers\nOvarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Treatment\nOvarian Germ Cell Tumors Treatment\nOvarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors Treatment\nIn the United States, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women.\nWhile ovarian cancer is rare, it is the leading cause of  death from\ncancer\nof the female reproductive system. The number of new cases of ovarian cancer decreased slightly each year from 1990 to the mid-2010s, but increased slightly each year from 2014 to 2018. There was a slight decrease in the number of deaths from ovarian cancer each year from 2015 to 2019.\nDifferent factors increase or decrease the risk of getting ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers.\nAnything that increases your chance of getting a disease\n\t\t  is called a\nrisk factor\n. Anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a\nprotective factor\n.\nFor information about risk factors and protective factors for ovarian cancer, see\nOvarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Prevention\n.\nTalk to your doctor about your risk of ovarian cancer.\nOvarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Screening\nKey Points\nTests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does  not have symptoms.\nScreening tests have not been shown to decrease the chance of dying from ovarian cancer.\nScreening tests that have been studied include:\nPelvic exam\nTransvaginal ultrasound\nCA-125 assay\nScreening tests for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are being studied in clinical trials.\nTests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does  not have symptoms.\nScientists\nstudy\nscreening\ntests to find those with the fewest harms and most benefits.\nCancer\nscreening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes\nsymptoms\n)  helps a person live longer or decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, the chance of\nrecovery\nis better if the disease is found and treated at an early\nstage\n.\nScreening tests have not been shown to decrease the chance of dying from ovarian cancer.\nScreening tests that have been studied include:\nPelvic exam\nPelvic exams\nto screen for ovarian cancer have not been shown to decrease the number of deaths from the disease. A pelvic exam is an exam of the\nvagina\n,\ncervix\n,\nuterus\n,\nfallopian tubes\n,\novaries\n, and\nrectum\n.    A\nspeculum\nis inserted into the vagina and the doctor or\nnurse\nlooks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two\nlubricated\n, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower\nabdomen\nto feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or\nabnormal\nareas.\nEnlarge\nPelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.\nTransvaginal ultrasound\nTransvaginal ultrasound\n(TVU) to screen for ovarian cancer has not been shown to decrease the number of deaths from the disease. TVU is a procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and\nbladder\n. An\nultrasound transducer\n(probe)  is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (\nultrasound\n) off internal\ntissues\nor\norgans\nand make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n.\nEnlarge\nTransvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nCA-125 assay\nA\nCA-125\nassay\nis a test that measures the level of CA-125 in the\nblood\n.  CA-125 is a type of\nbiomarker\n(a substance released by\ncells\ninto the bloodstream that may be a sign of a\ncondition\nor disease). An increased CA-125 level is sometimes a sign of certain types of cancer, including ovarian cancer, or other conditions.\nStudies have also shown that using CA-125 levels and TVU together to screen for ovarian cancer does not decrease the number of deaths from ovarian cancer.\nScreening tests for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are being studied in clinical trials.\nInformation about\nclinical trials\nsupported by\nNCI\ncan be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nRisks of Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Screening\nKey Points\nScreening tests have risks.\nThe risks of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers        screening tests include the following:\nFinding ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers may not improve health or help a woman live\n\t\t\t longer.\nFalse-negative test results can occur.\nFalse-positive test results can occur.\nScreening tests have risks.\nDecisions about\nscreening\ntests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may\n\t\t  want to talk about  the test with your doctor.  It is important to know the risks of\n\t\t  the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from\ncancer\n.\nThe risks of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers        screening tests include the following:\nFinding ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers may not improve health or help a woman live\n\t\t\t longer.\nScreening\n\t\t\t may not improve your health or help  you live longer if  you have\nadvanced\novarian cancer\nor if it has already spread to\n\t\t\t other places in  your body.\nFalse-negative test results can occur.\nScreening test results may appear to be normal even though ovarian cancer is\n\t\t\t present. A woman who receives a\nfalse-negative test result\n(one that\n\t\t\t shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care  even if she has symptoms.\nFalse-positive test results can occur.\nScreening test results may appear to be\nabnormal\neven though no\n\t\t\t cancer is present. A\nfalse-positive test result\n(one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause\nanxiety\nand is usually followed by more  tests  (such as\n\t\t\t  a\nlaparoscopy\nor a\nlaparotomy\nto see if cancer is present), which also have risks. Problems caused by tests used to\ndiagnose\novarian cancer include\ninfection\n,\nblood\nloss,\nbowel\ninjury, and heart and\nblood vessel\nproblems. A false-positive test result can also lead to an unneeded\noophorectomy\n(removal of one or both\novaries\n).\nAbout This PDQ Summary\nAbout PDQ\nPhysician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in\nSpanish\n.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers screening.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the\nPDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board\n.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at\nNCI's website\n.

Medulloblastoma is the most common type of\nCNS\nembryonal tumor\n. CNS embryonal tumors are uncontrolled growths of cells in the brain. These tumors form in cells that are left over from\nfetal\ndevelopment, called embryonal cells.\nPineoblastoma\nis a fast-growing type of brain tumor that forms in or around a tiny organ near the center of the brain called the\npineal gland\n.\nThese tumors may be\nbenign\n(not cancer) or\nmalignant\n(cancer). Benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain but rarely spread to other parts of the brain.  Malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other parts of the brain. They may also spread to other parts of the body, but this is rare. When a tumor grows into and presses on an area of the brain or spreads to other parts of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause serious\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nand need treatment.\nMost medulloblastomas, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastomas in children are malignant. These tumors tend to spread through the\ncerebrospinal fluid\nto other parts of  the brain and\nspinal cord\n.\nAlthough cancer is rare in children, brain tumors are the second most common type of\nchildhood cancer\n, after\nleukemia\n. \n\nThis summary is about  the treatment of\nprimary\nbrain tumors (tumors that begin in the brain).\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the inside of the brain, showing the pineal and pituitary glands, optic nerve, ventricles (with cerebrospinal fluid shown in blue), and other parts of the brain.\nThere are different types of CNS embryonal tumors.\nThe different types of CNS embryonal tumors include:\nMedulloblastomas\nMost CNS embryonal tumors are medulloblastomas. Medulloblastomas   are fast-growing tumors that  form in brain cells in the cerebellum.  The cerebellum is at the lower  back part of the brain  between the\ncerebrum\nand the\nbrain stem\n. The cerebellum controls movement, balance, and posture. It is rare for medulloblastomas to spread to the bone,\nbone marrow\n,\nlung\n, or other parts of the body.\nOther types of CNS embryonal tumors (nonmedulloblastoma)\nOther types of CNS embryonal tumors are fast-growing tumors and may form in brain cells anywhere in the brain, including the cerebrum, brain stem, or spinal cord. The cerebrum is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain. The cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem-solving, emotions, speech, reading, writing, and voluntary movement. It is rare for these tumors to spread to the bone, bone marrow, lung, or other parts of the body.\nThere are many types of CNS embryonal (nonmedulloblastoma) tumors:\nCribriform neuroepithelial tumors\nCribriform\nneuroepithelial\ntumor forms in the\nventricles\nin the brain. This tumor most often occurs in infants and young children. Cribriform neuroepithelial tumor occurs more often in boys.\nEmbryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes\nEmbryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) are rare tumors that form in the brain and spinal cord. ETMR most commonly occur in young children and are fast-growing tumors.\nCNS neuroblastomas\nCNS\nneuroblastomas\nare a very rare type of neuroblastoma that form in the nerve tissue of the cerebrum or the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord. CNS neuroblastomas may be large and    spread to other parts of the brain or spinal cord.\nCNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with a change in the\nBCOR\ngene\nCNS\nhigh-grade\nneuroepithelial tumor is a very rare tumor that forms in the brain. This tumor occurs most often in children younger than 10 years, but can occur in older children and adolescents.\nCNS Ewing sarcoma with a change in the\nCIC\ngene\nCNS\nEwing sarcoma\nis a very rare tumor found in the brain or\nspine\n. This tumor most often occurs in children younger than 10 years.\nCNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with a change in the\nMN1\ngene\nCNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor is a very rare tumor that forms in the brain or spinal cord. This tumor most often occurs in adolescents and females.\nMedulloepitheliomas\nMedulloepithelioma  is a fast-growing tumor that usually forms  in the brain, spinal cord, or nerves just outside the\nspinal column\n. It occurs most often in infants and young children.\nCNS\natypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor\nis also a type of embryonal tumor, but it is treated differently than other childhood CNS embryonal tumors. For more information, see\nChildhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor Treatment\n.\nPineoblastoma forms in cells of the pineal gland.\nThe pineal gland is a tiny organ in the center of the brain. The gland makes\nmelatonin\n, a substance that helps control our sleep cycle.\nPineoblastoma\nare usually malignant   fast-growing tumors with cells that  look very different from normal pineal gland cells. Pineoblastomas are not a type of CNS embryonal tumor but treatment for them is similar to treatment for CNS embryonal tumors.\nPineoblastoma is linked with\ninherited\nchanges in the\nretinoblastoma\n(\nRB1\n) gene. A child with the inherited form of  retinoblastoma (cancer that forms in the tissues of the\nretina\n) has an increased risk of pineoblastoma. When retinoblastoma forms at the same time as a tumor in or near the pineal gland, it is called trilateral retinoblastoma.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging) testing in  children with retinoblastoma may detect pineoblastoma at an early stage when it can be treated successfully. It is rare for pineoblastoma to spread to the bone, bone marrow, lung, or other parts of the body.\nCertain genetic conditions increase the risk of childhood medulloblastoma.\nChildhood medulloblastoma is caused by certain changes to the way brain cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. Often, the exact cause of the cell changes is unknown. To learn more about how cancer develops, see\nWhat is Cancer?\n.\nA\nrisk factor\nis anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Not every child with one or more of these risk factors will develop medulloblastoma, and it will develop in some children who don't have a known risk factor. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.\nThe risk for medulloblastoma is increased in people who have any of the following inherited diseases:\nTurcot syndrome\nRubinstein-Taybi syndrome\nNevoid basal cell carcinoma (Gorlin) syndrome\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome\nFanconi anemia\nGenetic counseling may be done for children with medulloblastoma or pineoblastoma.\nIt may not be clear from the\nfamily medical history\nwhether a child with a brain tumor has an inherited condition that increased their risk.\nGenetic counselors\nand other specially trained health professionals can discuss your child's\ndiagnosis\nand the family's medical history to understand:\nyour options for\nELP1\n,\nAPC\n,\nSUFU\n,\nPTCH1\n,\nTP53\n,\nPALB2\n, or\nBRCA2\ngene testing if your child has medulloblastoma\nyour options for\nRB1\nor\nDICER1\ngene testing if your child has pineoblastoma\nthe risk of other cancers for your child\nthe risk of cancer for your child's siblings\nthe risks and benefits of learning\ngenetic\ninformation\nGenetic counselors can also help you cope with your child's\ngenetic testing\nresults, including how to discuss the results with family members.\nSymptoms of medulloblastoma, other  CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma depend on the child's age and where the tumor is.\nChildren may not have symptoms of medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, or pineoblastoma until the tumor has grown bigger. It's important to check with your child's doctor if your child has any symptoms below:\nloss of balance, trouble walking, lack of coordination, or slow speech\nheadache, especially in the morning, or headache that goes away after\nvomiting\ngeneral weakness\nweakness on one side of the face\nunusual sleepiness or change in energy level\nseizures\ndouble vision or other eye problems\nnausea\nand vomiting\nInfants and young children with these tumors may be irritable or grow slowly. Also they may not eat well or meet\ndevelopmental milestones\nsuch as sitting, walking, and talking in sentences. These tumors may also cause an increase in the size of an infant's head.\nThese symptoms may be caused by conditions other than medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, or pineoblastoma. The only way to know is to see your child's doctor. The doctor will ask you when the symptoms started and how often your child has been having them as a first step in making the diagnosis.\nTests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to diagnose childhood medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma.\nIf your child has symptoms that suggest medulloblastoma, another type of CNS embryonal tumor, or pineoblastoma, the doctor will need to find out if these are due to cancer or another condition. They will ask about your child's\npersonal\nand family health history and do a\nphysical exam\n. Depending on the results, the doctor may recommend tests to find out if your child has a brain tumor. The results of these tests will also help you and your child's doctor plan treatment.\nThe following tests and procedures are used to diagnose medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma:\nMRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain and spinal cord with\ngadolinium\nis a procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is\ninjected\ninto a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Sometimes magnetic resonance\nspectroscopy\n(MRS) is   \ndone during the MRI scan to look at the chemicals in brain tissue.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\nuses a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine to make a series of detailed pictures inside the body from different angles. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. To learn more, see\nComputed Tomography (CT) Scans and Cancer\n.\nLumbar puncture\nis a procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is     checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells. The sample may also be checked for the amounts of\nprotein\nand\nglucose\n. A higher-than-normal amount of protein or lower-than-normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\nEnlarge\nLumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.\nA biopsy may be done to be sure of the diagnosis.\nIf doctors think your child may have medulloblastoma, another type of CNS embryonal tumor, or pineoblastoma, a\nbiopsy\nmay be done. The biopsy is done by removing part of the\nskull\nand using a needle to remove a sample of tissue. Sometimes, a computer-guided needle is used to remove the tissue sample. A\npathologist\nviews the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery. The piece of skull is usually put back in place after the procedure.\nEnlarge\nCraniotomy.  An opening is made in the skull and a piece of the skull is removed to show part of the brain.\nThe following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:\nImmunohistochemistry\nis a\nlaboratory test\nthat uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient's tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nIf your child has been diagnosed with medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumor, or pineoblastoma, you may have questions about how serious the cancer is and your child's chances of survival. The likely outcome or course of a disease is called prognosis.\nThe prognosis and treatment options depend on:\nthe type of tumor and where it is in the brain\nwhether the cancer has spread within the brain and spinal cord when the tumor is found\nthe age of the child when the tumor is found\nhow much of the tumor remains after surgery\nwhether there are certain changes in the\nchromosomes\n, genes, or brain cells\nwhether the tumor has just been diagnosed or  has\nrecurred\n(come back)\nYour child's cancer care team is in the best position to talk with you about your child's prognosis.\nYou may want to get a second opinion.\nYou may want to get a\nsecond opinion\nto confirm your child's diagnosis and treatment plan. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get important medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the\npathology report\n, slides, and scans before giving a recommendation. The doctor who gives the second opinion may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another approach, or provide more information about your child's tumor.\nTo learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see\nFinding Cancer Care\n. You can contact\nNCI's Cancer Information Service\nvia chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor or hospital that can provide a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, see\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor About Cancer\n.\nStaging Childhood Medulloblastoma, Other Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors, and Pineoblastoma\nKey Points\nMedulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma in children are treated based on the tumor type and the child's age.\nTreatment of medulloblastoma in children older than 3 years  also depends on whether the tumor is average risk or high risk.\nAverage risk\nHigh risk\nThe results of the tests and procedures done to diagnose medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma in children are used to plan cancer treatment.\nSometimes childhood medulloblastoma and other central nervous system embryonal tumors come back after treatment.\nMedulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma in children are treated based on the tumor type and the child's age.\nCancer stage  describes the extent of cancer in the body, such as the size of the\ntumor\n, whether it has spread, and how far it has spread from where it first formed. There is no\nstaging system\nused for childhood\nmedulloblastoma\n, other\ncentral nervous system\n(CNS)\nembryonal tumors,\nor\npineoblastoma,\nbut the tests and procedures done to\ndiagnose\nthe cancer are also used to help plan treatment.\nTreatment of other CNS embryonal tumors and pineoblastoma in children is based on the child's age. Children aged 3 years and younger  may be given different treatment than children older than 3 years.\nTreatment of medulloblastoma in children older than 3 years  also depends on whether the tumor is average risk or high risk.\nAverage risk\nMedulloblastomas are called average risk when all of the following are true:\nThe tumor was completely removed by\nsurgery\nor there was only a very small amount remaining.\nThe cancer has not spread to other parts of the\n\t\t\t\tbody.\nHigh risk\nMedulloblastomas are called high risk if any of the following are true:\nSome of the tumor was not  removed by\n\t\t\t\tsurgery.\nThe cancer has spread to other parts of the\nbrain\nor\nspinal cord\nor to other parts of the body.\nIn general, cancer is more likely to\nrecur\n(come back) after treatment in patients  with a high-risk tumor.\nThe results of the tests and procedures done to diagnose medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma in children are used to plan cancer treatment.\nIf your child is diagnosed with medulloblastoma, another type of CNS embryonal tumor, or pineoblastoma, they will be referred to a\npediatric oncologist\n/\nneuro-oncologist\n. This is a doctor who specializes in staging and treating childhood cancers. They will recommend tests to determine the extent (stage) of cancer. Some of the tests used to diagnose the cancer are repeated after surgery. This is to find out how much tumor remains after surgery and to see if the cancer has spread from the brain to the\nspine\nor other parts of the body. It is important to know if the cancer has spread in order to plan the best treatment. For the list of diagnostic tests, see the\nGeneral Information\nsection.\nThe following tests may be used to find out if the cancer has spread beyond the brain and spinal cord:\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\nare procedures in which a sample of\nbone marrow\nand bone is removed from the hipbone or\nbreastbone\nusing a special needle. A\npathologist\nviews the sample under a microscope to look for\nsigns\nof cancer.\nA bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are only done when there are signs the cancer has spread to the bone marrow.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.\nBone scan\nis a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing\ncells\n, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of\nradioactive\nmaterial is\ninjected\ninto a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a\nscanner\n. A bone scan is only done when there are signs or\nsymptoms\nthat       the cancer has spread to the bone.\nSometimes childhood medulloblastoma and other central nervous system embryonal tumors come back after treatment.\nChildhood medulloblastoma and other types of CNS embryonal tumors most often recur (come back) within 3 years after treatment but may come back many years later. Recurrent childhood medulloblastoma and other CNS embryonal tumors may come back  in the same place as the original tumor and/or in a different place in the brain or spinal cord.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for children who have medulloblastoma and other central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors.\nChildren who have medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children.\nThe following types of treatment may be used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue\nTargeted therapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThere are different types of treatment for children who have medulloblastoma and other central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors.\nThere are different types of treatment for children and\nadolescents\nwith\nmedulloblastoma\n, other types of\nCNS\nembryonal tumors\n, or\npineoblastoma\n. You and your child's cancer care team will work together to decide treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as your child's overall health and whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has come back.\nChildren who have medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children.\nA pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer, will oversee treatment of medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with\nbrain tumors\nand who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists and others:\npediatrician\nneurosurgeon\nneurologist\nneuropathologist\nneuroradiologist\nrehabilitation specialist\nradiation oncologist\npsychologist\nYour child's treatment plan will include information about the cancer, the goals of treatment, treatment options, and the possible\nside effects\n. It will be helpful to talk with your child's cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect. For help every step of the way, see our downloadable booklet,\nChildren with Cancer: A Guide for Parents\n.\nThe following types of treatment may be used:\nSurgery\nSurgery is used to diagnose and treat childhood medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma as described in the\nGeneral Information\nsection of this summary.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given\nchemotherapy\n,\nradiation therapy\n, or both to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. Medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, or pineoblastoma in children may be treated with\nexternal beam radiation therapy\n. External beam radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nCertain ways of giving external radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:\nConformal radiation therapy\nuses a computer to make a\n3-dimensional\n(3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high\ndose\nof radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.\nStereotactic radiation therapy\nuses a machine that aims  radiation directly at the tumor, causing less damage to nearby healthy tissue.  The total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days. A rigid head frame is attached to the\nskull\nto keep the head still during this radiation treatment.  This procedure is also called stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotaxic radiation therapy.\nBecause radiation therapy can affect growth and brain development in young children, especially children who are 3 years or younger, chemotherapy may be given to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy.\nRadiation therapy to the brain can also affect\ngrowth and development\nin children older than 3 years. For this reason,\nclinical trials\nare studying new ways of giving radiation that may have fewer side effects than\nstandard\nmethods.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy (also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   Chemotherapy may be given alone or with other types of treatment, such as radiation therapy.\nTo treat medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma, chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a vein. When given this way, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body.  Chemotherapy drugs that can cross the\nblood-brain barrier\nand reach tumor cells in the brain are used. These include:\ncarboplatin\ncisplatin\ncyclophosphamide\netoposide\nirinotecan\nlomustine\nmethotrexate\ntemozolomide\nthiotepa\ntopotecan\nvincristine\nCombinations of these drugs may be used. Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.\nLearn more about\nChemotherapy to Treat Cancer\n.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue\nHigh doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. This cancer treatment destroys healthy cells, including blood-forming cells.\nStem cell transplant\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nuses drugs or other substances to block the action of specific\nenzymes\n,\nproteins\n, or other\nmolecules\ninvolved in the growth and spread of cancer cells.\nVismodegib\nmay be used to treat\nrecurrent\nmedulloblastoma in children who have finished growing.\nTargeted therapy is also being studied for the treatment of childhood medulloblastoma and other CNS embryonal tumors that have recurred (come back) after treatment.\nLearn more about\nTargeted Therapy to Treat Cancer\n.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nA treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nTo learn more, see\nClinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers\n. \nBecause cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nTreatment of Childhood Medulloblastoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nYounger children with medulloblastoma\nTreatment of newly diagnosed\nmedulloblastoma\nin children aged 3 years and younger includes:\nSurgery\nto remove as much of the tumor as possible, followed by\nchemotherapy\n.\nOther treatments that may be given after surgery include:\nHigh-dose\nsystemic\nand\nintraventricular\nchemotherapy.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy\nwith\nstem cell rescue\n.\nChemotherapy with or without\nradiation therapy\nto the area where the tumor was removed.\nChildren older than 3 years with average-risk medulloblastoma\nTreatment of newly diagnosed average-risk medulloblastoma in children older than 3 years includes:\nSurgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible.

Signs of this syndrome include the following:\ndelayed ability to speak\ntrouble swallowing and eating\nloss of balance, trouble walking, and worsening handwriting\nloss of muscle tone\nmood swings and changes in personality\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child and the types of symptoms to expect after cancer treatment has ended. To learn more, see\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\n.\nFollow-Up Testing\nSome of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the\nstage\nof the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. This is sometimes called re-staging. For a list of tests, see the\nGeneral Information\nsection.\nSome of the\nimaging tests\nwill continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the brain tumor has recurred (come back). If the imaging tests show\nabnormal\ntissue in the brain, a biopsy may also be done to find out if the tissue is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing. These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.\nCoping With Cancer\nWhen a child has cancer, every member of the family needs support. Honest and calm conversations build trust as you talk with your child and their siblings. Taking care of yourself during this difficult time is also important. Reach out to your child's treatment team and to people in your family and community for support.

It is where stool (solid waste) leaves the body. The anus is formed partly from the outer skin layers of the body and partly from the intestine. The anus is connected to the\nrectum\nby the anal canal, which is about 1 to 1½ inches long. This area is controlled by two ring-like sphincter muscles, which contract to hold stool in and relax to allow its passage out of the body.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the lower gastrointestinal (digestive) system showing  the colon, rectum, and anus. Other organs that make up the digestive system are also shown.\nAnal cancer can start in the lining of the anal canal, called the mucosa, or in the perianal skin, the squamous cells outside of the anus that contain hair follicles and sweat glands.\nTumors\nof the perianal skin that do not involve the anal\nsphincter  are usually  treated the same as anal cancers, although local therapy (treatment directed to a limited area of skin) may be used for some.\nMost anal cancers are related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.\nRisk factors\nfor anal cancer include:\nbeing\ninfected\nwith a\nhigh-risk human papillomavirus\n(HPV), especially HPV type 16 or 18\nhaving a condition or disease that causes a weakened\nimmune system\n, such as\nHIV\nor an organ\ntransplant\nhaving a\npersonal history\nof\nvulvar\n,\nvaginal\n, or\ncervical cancers\nhaving many sexual partners\nhaving receptive anal intercourse (anal sex)\nsmoking\ncigarettes\nSigns of anal cancer include bleeding from the anus or rectum or a lump near the anus.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by anal cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have:\nbleeding from the anus or rectum\na lump near the anus\npain or pressure in the area around the anus\nitching or\ndischarge\nfrom the anus\na change in\nbowel\nhabits\nTests that examine the rectum and anus are used to diagnose anal  cancer.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nDigital rectal examination\n(DRE)\nis an exam of the anus and rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts a\nlubricated\n, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual.\nEnlarge\nDigital rectal exam (DRE). The doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum and feels the rectum, anus, and prostate (in males) to check for anything abnormal.\nAnoscopy\nis an exam of the anus and lower rectum using a short, lighted tube called an anoscope.\nProctoscopy\nis a procedure to look inside the rectum and anus to check for\nabnormal\nareas, using a proctoscope. A proctoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing the inside of the rectum and anus. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.\nEndo-anal or\nendorectal ultrasound\nis a procedure in which an\nultrasound transducer\n(probe) is inserted into the anus or rectum and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.\nBiopsy\nis the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. If an abnormal area is seen during the anoscopy, a biopsy may be done at that time.\nAfter anal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the anus or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if cancer has spread within the anus or to other\nparts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from this\nstaging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know\nthe stage in order to plan treatment. The following tests may be used in the staging process:\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\nuses a computer linked to an x-ray machine to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\nabdomen\n,\npelvis\n, or chest. The pictures are taken from different angles and are used to create 3-D views of tissues and organs.  A dye may be\ninjected\ninto a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nChest x-ray\nis an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\nis a procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\nuses a small amount of radioactive glucose that is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes pictures of where glucose is being used in the body. Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nPelvic exam\nis an exam of the\nvagina\n,\ncervix\n,\nuterus\n,\nfallopian tubes\n,\novaries\n, and\nrectum\n.    A\nspeculum\nis inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A\nPap test\nof the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower\nabdomen\nto feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.\nEnlarge\nPelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.\nSome people decide to get a second opinion.\nYou may want to get a second opinion to confirm your anal cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans. They may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another treatment approach, or provide more information about your cancer.\nLearn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion at\nFinding Cancer Care\n. You can contact\nNCI’s Cancer Information Service\nvia chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor, hospital, or getting a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, visit\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor About Cancer\n.\nCertain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe prognosis depends on:\nthe size of the tumor\nwhether the cancer has spread to the\nlymph nodes\nThe treatment options depend on:\nthe\nstage\nof the cancer\nwhere the tumor  is in the anus\nwhether the person has HIV\nwhether cancer remains  after initial treatment or has recurred (come back)\nStages of Anal Cancer\nKey Points\nThe following stages are used for anal cancer:\nStage 0 (carcinoma in situ)\nStage I (also called stage 1) anal cancer\nStage II (also called stage 2) anal cancer\nStage III (also called stage 3) anal cancer\nStage IV (also called stage 4) anal cancer\nAnal cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nThe following stages are used for anal cancer:\nStage 0 (carcinoma in situ)\nIn stage 0,\nabnormal\ncells are found in the mucosa (innermost layer) of the anus. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called high-grade  intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).\nStage I (also called stage 1) anal cancer\nIn stage I,  cancer has formed and the  tumor is  2\ncentimeters\nor smaller.\nStage II (also called stage 2) anal cancer\nStage II anal cancer\nis divided into stages IIA and IIB.\nIn stage IIA, the tumor is larger than 2\ncentimeters\nbut not larger than 5 centimeters.\nIn stage IIB, the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters.\nStage III (also called stage 3) anal cancer\nStage III anal cancer is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC.\nIn stage IIIA, the tumor is 5\ncentimeters\nor smaller and has spread to\nlymph nodes\nnear the anus or\ngroin\n.\nIn stage IIIB, the tumor is any size and has spread to nearby organs, such as the\nvagina\n,\nurethra\n, or\nbladder\n. Cancer has not spread to lymph nodes.\nIn stage IIIC, the tumor is any size and may have spread to nearby organs. Cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the anus or groin.\nStage IV (also called stage 4) anal cancer\nIn stage IV, the tumor is any size. Cancer may have spread to\nlymph nodes\nor nearby organs and has spread to other parts of the body, such as the\nliver\nor\nlungs\n.\nStage IV anal cancer is also called metastatic anal cancer. Metastatic cancer happens when cancer cells travel through the\nlymphatic system\nor blood and form tumors in other parts of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if anal cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually anal cancer cells. The disease is called metastatic anal cancer, not liver cancer. Learn more in\nMetastatic Cancer: When Cancer Spreads\n.\nAnal cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.\nRecurrent anal cancer is cancer that has come back after it has been treated. If anal cancer comes back, it may come back in the anus or in other parts of the body, such as the liver or\n\t\tlungs. Tests will be done to help determine where the cancer has returned. The type of treatment for recurrent anal cancer will depend on where it has come back.\nLearn more in\nRecurrent Cancer: When Cancer Comes Back\n. Information to help you cope and talk with your health care team can be found in the booklet\nWhen Cancer Returns\n.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for  people with anal cancer.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nRadiosensitizers\nImmunotherapy\nTreatment for anal cancer may cause side effects.\nFollow-up care may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for  people with anal cancer.\nDifferent types of treatments are available for anal cancer. You and your cancer care team will work together to decide your treatment plan, which may include more than one type of treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as the stage of the cancer, your overall health, and your preferences. Your plan will include information about your cancer, the goals of treatment, your treatment options and the possible side effects, and the expected length of treatment.\nTalking with your cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect will be helpful. You’ll want to learn what you need to do before treatment begins, how you’ll feel while going through it, and what kind of help you will need. To learn more, visit\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor About Treatment\n.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nSurgery\nLocal resection is a  surgical procedure in which the tumor is cut from the anus along with some of the healthy tissue around it. Local resection may be used if the cancer is small and has not spread. This procedure may save the\nsphincter\nmuscles so the person can still control\nbowel\nmovements. Tumors that form in the lower part of the anus can often be removed with local resection.\nAbdominoperineal resection\nis a surgical procedure in which the anus, the\nrectum\n, and part of the\nsigmoid colon\nare removed through an\nincision\nmade in the\nabdomen\n. The doctor sews the end of the\nintestine\nto an opening, called a\nstoma\n, made in the surface of the abdomen so body waste can be collected in a disposable bag outside of the body. This is called a\ncolostomy\n.\nLymph nodes\nthat contain cancer may also be removed during this operation. This procedure   is used only  for cancer that remains or comes back after treatment with\nradiation therapy\nand chemotherapy.\nEnlarge\nResection of the colon with colostomy. Part of the colon containing the cancer and nearby healthy tissue are removed, a stoma is created, and a colostomy bag is attached to the stoma.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nuses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy used to treat anal cancer:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer.\nLearn more about\nRadiation Therapy to Treat Cancer\nand\nRadiation Therapy Side Effects\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy (also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nChemotherapy drugs used to treat anal cancer include:\ncapecitabine\ncisplatin\nfluorouracil\nmitomycin\nCombinations of these drugs may be used. Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.\nChemotherapy may be combined with other types of treatment, such as radiation therapy.\nLearn more about how chemotherapy works, how it is given, common side effects, and more at\nChemotherapy to Treat Cancer\nand\nChemotherapy and You: Support for People With Cancer\n.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nA treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be an option.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

Sarcoma is\ncancer\nof\nsoft tissue\n(such as muscle),\nconnective tissue\n(such as\ntendon\nor\ncartilage\n), or bone. Rhabdomyosarcoma usually begins in muscles that are attached to  bones and that help the body move, but it may begin in many places in the body. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children.\nThere are four main types of rhabdomyosarcoma:\nEmbryonal\n: This type occurs most often  in the head and neck area or  in the\ngenital\nor\nurinary\norgans\n, but can occur anywhere in the body. It is the most common type of rhabdomyosarcoma.\nAlveolar\n: This type occurs most often in the arms or legs, chest,\nabdomen\n, genital organs, or\nanal\narea.\nSpindle cell\n/sclerosing: The spindle cell type occurs most often in the paratesticular (\ntestis\nor\nspermatic cord\n) area. There are two other spindle cell/sclerosing subtypes. One is more common in infants and is found in the\ntrunk\narea. The other can affect children,\nadolescents\n, and adults. It is often found in the head and neck area, and is more\naggressive\n.\nPleomorphic\n: This is the least common type of rhabdomyosarcoma in children.\nSee the following\nPDQ\ntreatment summaries for information about other types of soft tissue sarcoma:\nSoft Tissue Sarcoma\nChildhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma\nCertain genetic conditions increase the risk of  childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.\nAnything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child’s doctor if you think your child may be at risk.\nRisk factors for rhabdomyosarcoma include having the following\ninherited\ndiseases:\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome\n.\nDicer1 syndrome\n.\nNeurofibromatosis type 1\n(NF1).\nCostello syndrome\n.\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome\n.\nNoonan syndrome\n.\nChildren who had a high birth weight or were larger than expected at birth may have an increased risk of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.\nIn most cases, the cause of rhabdomyosarcoma is not known.\nA sign of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is a lump or swelling that keeps getting bigger.\nSigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by childhood rhabdomyosarcoma or by other\nconditions\n.

It may be painful.\nCrossed-eyes or bulging of the eye.\nHeadache.\nTrouble\nurinating\nor having\nbowel\nmovements.\nBlood\nin the urine.\nBleeding in the nose,\nthroat\n,\nvagina\n, or\nrectum\n.\nDiagnostic tests and a biopsy are used to diagnose childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.\nThe\ndiagnostic tests\nthat are done depend in part on where the cancer forms. The following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nX-ray\n: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the body, such as the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen,\npelvis\n, or\nlymph nodes\n, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or\ntissues\nshow up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nEnlarge\nComputed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the\nskull\n,\nbrain\n, and lymph nodes.

The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor\ncells\nin the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive glucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where\nglucose\nis being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nEnlarge\nPositron emission tomography (PET) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the PET scanner. The head rest and white strap help the child lie still.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the child's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body.  Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nBone scan\n: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of\nradioactive\nmaterial is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.\nEnlarge\nBone scan.  A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the child's vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive material collects in the bones. As the child lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen.\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\n: The removal of\nbone marrow\n, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone. Samples are removed from both hipbones. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a\nmicroscope\nto look for signs of cancer.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.\nLumbar puncture\n: A procedure used to collect\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) from the\nspinal column\n. This is done by placing a needle     between two bones in the\nspine\nand into the CSF around the\nspinal cord\nand removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer cells. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\nIf these tests show there may be a rhabdomyosarcoma, a biopsy is done. A biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed   under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Because treatment depends on the type of rhabdomyosarcoma,\nbiopsy samples\nshould be checked by a pathologist who has experience in\ndiagnosing\nrhabdomyosarcoma.\nOne of the following types of biopsies may be used:\nFine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy\n: The removal of tissue or\nfluid\nusing a thin needle.\nCore needle biopsy\n: The removal of tissue using a wide needle. This procedure may be guided using\nultrasound\n, CT scan, or MRI.\nOpen biopsy\n: The removal of tissue through an\nincision\n(cut) made in the skin.\nSentinel lymph node biopsy\n:  The removal of the\nsentinel lymph node\nduring\nsurgery\n. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node in a group of lymph nodes to receive\nlymphatic drainage\nfrom the\nprimary tumor\n. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor.  A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor.  The substance or dye flows through the\nlymph\nducts\nto the lymph nodes.  The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed.   A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.  If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy may be used for patients with rhabdomyosarcoma of the limbs or\ntrunk\nwhen enlarged lymph nodes are not found with  imaging or physical exam.\nThe following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:\nLight\nmicroscopy\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.\nImmunohistochemistry\n: A laboratory test that uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nFISH\n(fluorescence in situ hybridization)\n: A laboratory test used to look at and count\ngenes\nor\nchromosomes\nin cells and tissues. Pieces of\nDNA\nthat contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient’s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.\nReverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction\n(RT–PCR) test\n: A laboratory test in which the amount of a\ngenetic\nsubstance called\nmRNA\nmade by a specific gene is measured. An enzyme called reverse transcriptase is used to convert a specific piece of\nRNA\ninto a matching piece of DNA, which can be amplified (made in large numbers) by another enzyme called DNA polymerase. The amplified DNA copies help tell whether a specific mRNA is being made by a gene. RT–PCR can be used to check the activation of certain genes that may indicate the presence of cancer cells. This test may be used to look for certain changes in a gene or chromosome, which may help diagnose cancer.\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A laboratory test in which the chromosomes of cells in a sample of tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe patient's age.\nWhere in the body the\ntumor\nstarted.\nThe size of the tumor  at the time of diagnosis.\nWhether the tumor has been completely removed by surgery.\nThe type of rhabdomyosarcoma (\nembryonal\n,\nalveolar\n,\nspindle cell\n/sclerosing, or\npleomorphic\n).\nWhether there are certain changes in the genes.\nWhether the tumor had spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis.\nWhether the tumor was in the lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis.\nWhether the tumor\nresponds\nto\nchemotherapy\nand/or\nradiation therapy\n.\nFor patients with\nrecurrent cancer\n, prognosis and treatment also depend on the following:\nWhere in the body the tumor recurred (came back).\nHow much time passed between the end of cancer treatment and when the cancer\nrecurred\n.\nWhether the cancer was previously treated with radiation therapy.\nStages of Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma\nKey Points\nAfter childhood rhabdomyosarcoma has been diagnosed, treatment is based in part on the stage of the cancer and sometimes it is based on whether all the cancer was removed by surgery.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nStaging of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is done in   three parts.\nThe  staging system is based on the size of the tumor, where it is in the body,  and whether it has spread to other parts of the body:\nStage 1\nStage 2\nStage 3\nStage 4\nThe grouping system is   based on whether the cancer has spread and whether all the cancer was removed by surgery:\nGroup I\nGroup II\nGroup III\nGroup IV\nThe risk group is based on the staging system  and the grouping system.\nLow-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma\nIntermediate-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma\nHigh-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma\nSometimes childhood rhabdomyosarcoma continues to grow or comes back after treatment.\nAfter childhood rhabdomyosarcoma has been diagnosed, treatment is based in part on the stage of the cancer and sometimes it is based on whether all the cancer was removed by surgery.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread within the\ntissue\nor to other\nparts of the body is called\nstaging\n. It is important to know the\nstage\nin order to plan treatment. The doctor will use results of the\ndiagnostic tests\nto help find out the stage of the disease.\nTreatment for childhood\nrhabdomyosarcoma\nis based in part on the stage and sometimes on the amount of cancer that remains after\nsurgery\nto remove the\ntumor\n. The\npathologist\nwill use a\nmicroscope\nto check the tissues removed during surgery, including tissue samples from the edges of the areas where the cancer was removed and the\nlymph nodes\n. This is done to see if all the cancer\ncells\nwere taken out during the surgery.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called\nmetastasis\n. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the\nprimary tumor\n) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a\ntumor\n(\nmetastatic\ntumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  rhabdomyosarcoma spreads to the\nlung\n, the cancer cells in the lung are actually rhabdomyosarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma, not lung cancer.\nMany cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.\nStaging of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is done in   three parts.\nChildhood rhabdomyosarcoma  is staged by using three different ways to describe the cancer:\nA\nstaging system\n.\nA grouping system.\nA\nrisk group\n.\nThe  staging system is based on the size of the tumor, where it is in the body,  and whether it has spread to other parts of the body:\nStage 1\nIn\nstage\n1, the tumor is any size, may have spread to\nlymph nodes\n, and is found  in only one of the following \"favorable\" sites:\nEye or area around the eye.\nHead and neck (but not in the\ntissue\nnear the ear, nose,\nsinuses\n, base of the\nskull\n,\nbrain\n, or\nspinal cord\n).\nGallbladder\nand\nbile ducts\n.\nUreters\nor\nurethra\n.\nTestes\n,\novary\n,\nvagina\n, or\nuterus\n.\nRhabdomyosarcoma\nthat forms in a \"favorable\" site has a better\nprognosis\n. If the site where cancer occurs is not one of the favorable sites listed above, it is said to be an \"unfavorable\" site.\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).\nStage 2\nIn\nstage\n2,\ncancer\nis found in an \"unfavorable\" site (any one area not described as \"favorable\" in stage 1). The\ntumor\nis  no larger than 5\ncentimeters\nand has not spread to\nlymph nodes\n.\nStage 3\nIn\nstage\n3,\ncancer\nis found in an \"unfavorable\" site (any one area not described as \"favorable\" in stage 1) and one of the following is true:\nThe\ntumor\nis no larger than 5\ncentimeters\nand cancer has spread to nearby\nlymph nodes\n.\nThe tumor is larger than 5 centimeters and cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nStage 4\nIn\nstage\n4, the\ntumor\nmay be any size and\ncancer\nmay have spread to nearby\nlymph nodes\n. Cancer has spread to\ndistant\nparts of  the body, such as the\nlung\n,\nbone marrow\n, or bone.\nThe grouping system is   based on whether the cancer has spread and whether all the cancer was removed by surgery:\nGroup I\nCancer\nwas found only in the place where it started and it was completely removed by\nsurgery\n.\nTissue\nwas taken from the edges of where the\ntumor\nwas removed.  This tissue was checked under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nand no cancer\ncells\nwere found.\nGroup II\nGroup II is divided into groups IIA, IIB, and IIC.\nIIA:\nCancer\nwas removed by\nsurgery\nbut cancer\ncells\nwere seen when the\ntissue\n, taken from the edges of where the\ntumor\nwas removed, was viewed under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\n.\nIIB: Cancer had spread to  nearby\nlymph nodes\nand the cancer and lymph nodes were removed by surgery.\nIIC: Cancer had spread to  nearby lymph nodes, the cancer and lymph nodes were removed by surgery, and at least one of the following is true:\nTissue taken from the edges of where the tumor was removed was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and cancer cells were seen.\nThe furthest lymph node from the tumor that was removed was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and cancer cells were seen.\nGroup III\nCancer\nwas partly removed by\nbiopsy\nor\nsurgery\nbut there is\ntumor\nremaining that can be seen with the eye.\nGroup IV\nCancer\nhad spread to\ndistant\nparts of the body when the cancer was\ndiagnosed\n.\nCancer cells are found by an\nimaging test\n; or\nThere are cancer cells in the\nfluid\naround the\nbrain\n,\nspinal cord\n, or\nlungs\n, or in fluid in the\nabdomen\n; or\ntumors\nare found in those areas.\nThe risk group is based on the staging system  and the grouping system.\nThe risk group describes the chance that rhabdomyosarcoma will\nrecur\n(come back). Every child  treated for  rhabdomyosarcoma should receive\nchemotherapy\nto decrease the chance cancer will recur. The type of anticancer drug,\ndose\n,  and the number of treatments given depends on whether the child has low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma.\nThe following risk groups are used:\nLow-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma\nLow-risk childhood\nrhabdomyosarcoma\nis one of the following:\nAn\nembryonal tumor\nof any size that is  found in a \"favorable\" site. There may be\ntumor\nremaining after\nsurgery\nthat can be seen with or without a\nmicroscope\n. The\ncancer\nmay have spread to nearby\nlymph nodes\n.    The following areas are \"favorable\" sites:\nEye or area around the eye.\nHead or neck (but not in the\ntissue\nnear the ear, nose,\nsinuses\n, base of the\nskull\n,\nbrain\n, or\nspinal cord\n).\nGallbladder\nand\nbile ducts\n.\nUreter\nor\nurethra\n.\nTestes\n,\novary\n,\nvagina\n, or\nuterus\n.\nAn embryonal tumor of any size   that is   not found in a \"favorable\" site. There may be  tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen only with a microscope. The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nIntermediate-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma\nIntermediate-risk childhood\nrhabdomyosarcoma\nis one of the following:\nAn\nembryonal tumor\nof any size  that is not found in one of the \"favorable\" sites listed above.  There is\ntumor\nremaining after\nsurgery\n, that can be seen with or without a\nmicroscope\n. The\ncancer\nmay have spread  to nearby\nlymph nodes\n.\nAn\nalveolar\ntumor of any size in  a \"favorable\" or \"unfavorable\" site.  There may be tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen with or without a microscope.  The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nHigh-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma\nHigh-risk childhood\nrhabdomyosarcoma\nmay be the\nembryonal\ntype or the\nalveolar\ntype. It may have spread to nearby\nlymph nodes\nand has spread to one or more of the following:\nOther parts of the body that are not near where the\ntumor\nfirst formed.\nFluid\naround the brain or\nspinal cord\n.\nFluid in the\nlung\nor\nabdomen\n.\nSometimes childhood rhabdomyosarcoma continues to grow or comes back after treatment.\nProgressive\nrhabdomyosarcoma\nis\ncancer\nthat continues to grow, spread, or get worse. Progressive disease may be a\nsign\nthat the cancer has become\nrefractory\nto treatment.\nRecurrent\nchildhood rhabdomyosarcoma is cancer that has\nrecurred\n(come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the same place or in other parts of the body, such as the\nlung\n, bone, or\nbone marrow\n. Less often, rhabdomyosarcoma may come back in the\nbreast\nin\nadolescent\nfemales or in the\nliver\n.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.\nChildren with rhabdomyosarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nThree types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nImmunotherapy\nTargeted therapy\nTreatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for  patients with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.\nSome treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.\nBecause cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.\nChildren with rhabdomyosarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.\nBecause\nrhabdomyosarcoma\ncan form in  many different parts of the body, many different kinds of treatments are used. Treatment will be overseen by a\npediatric oncologist\n, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer.  The pediatric oncologist works with  other\nhealth care providers\nwho are experts in treating children with rhabdomyosarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of\nmedicine\n.    These may include the following\nspecialists\n:\nPediatrician\n.\nPediatric surgeon\n.\nRadiation oncologist\n.\nPediatric hematologist\n.\nPediatric\nradiologist\n.\nPediatric nurse specialist\n.\nGeneticist\nor cancer\ngenetics risk counselor\n.\nSocial worker\n.\nRehabilitation specialist\n.\nThree types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nSurgery\n(removing the cancer in an operation) is used  to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma. A type of surgery called\nwide local excision\nis often done.  A wide local excision is the removal of\ntumor\nand some of the\ntissue\naround it, including  the\nlymph nodes\n. A second surgery may be needed to remove all the cancer. Whether surgery is done and the type of surgery done depends on the following:\nWhere in the body the tumor started.\nThe effect the surgery will have on the way the child will look.\nThe effect the surgery will have on the child's important body functions.\nHow the tumor\nresponded\nto\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nthat may have been given first.\nIn most children with rhabdomyosarcoma, it is not possible to remove all of the tumor by surgery.\nRhabdomyosarcoma can form in many different places in the body and the surgery will be different for each site.  Surgery to treat  rhabdomyosarcoma of the eye or\ngenital\nareas is usually a\nbiopsy\n.    Chemotherapy, and sometimes radiation therapy, may be given before surgery to  shrink large tumors.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, patients will  be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer\ncells\nthat are left. Radiation therapy may also be given. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.  There are two types of radiation therapy:\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:\nConformal radiation therapy\n: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a\n3-dimensional\n(3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high\ndose\nof radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.\nIntensity-modulated radiation therapy\n(IMRT): IMRT is a type of\n3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy\nthat uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.\nVolumetrical modulated arc therapy (VMAT): VMAT is type of 3-D radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. The radiation machine moves in a circle around the patient once during treatment and sends thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) at the tumor. Treatment with VMAT is delivered faster than treatment with IMRT.\nStereotactic body radiation therapy\n: Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue.  This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.\nProton beam radiation therapy\n: Proton-beam therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy. A radiation therapy machine aims streams of\nprotons\n(tiny, invisible, positively-charged particles) at the cancer cells to kill them. This type of treatment may cause less damage to nearby healthy tissue.\nInternal radiation therapy\nuses a\nradioactive\nsubstance sealed in needles,\nseeds\n, wires, or\ncatheters\nthat are placed directly into or near the cancer. It is used to treat cancer in areas such as  the\nvagina\n,\nvulva\n,\nuterus\n,\nbladder\n,\nprostate\n, head, or neck. Internal radiation therapy is also called brachytherapy, internal radiation, implant radiation, or interstitial radiation therapy. This approach involves special technical skills and is offered in only a few medical centers.\nThe type and amount of radiation therapy and when it is given depends on the age of the child, the type of rhabdomyosarcoma, where in the body the tumor started, how much tumor remained after surgery, and whether there is tumor in the nearby lymph nodes.\nExternal radiation therapy is usually used to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma but in certain cases internal radiation therapy is used.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nChemotherapy may also be given to shrink the tumor before surgery in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible. This is called\nneoadjuvant\nchemotherapy.\nEvery child  treated for  rhabdomyosarcoma should receive systemic chemotherapy to decrease the chance the cancer will recur. The type of anticancer drug, dose,  and the number of treatments given depends on the age of the child and whether the child has low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Rhabdomyosarcoma\nfor more information.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient’s\nimmune system\nto fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer.  This cancer treatment is a type of\nbiologic therapy\n. There are different types of immunotherapy:\nVaccine therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses a substance or group of substances to stimulate the immune system to find the tumor and kill it. Vaccine therapy is being studied to treat\nmetastatic\nrhabdomyosarcoma.\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor\ntherapy uses the body's immune system to kill cancer cells. Two types of immune checkpoint inhibitors are being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back after treatment:\nCTLA-4\nis a protein on the surface of\nT cells\nthat helps keep the body’s\nimmune responses\nin check. When CTLA-4 attaches to another\nprotein\ncalled B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. CTLA-4 inhibitors attach to CTLA-4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells.\nIpilimumab\nis being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back or\nprogressed\nduring treatment.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as B7-1/B7-2 on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and CTLA-4 on T cells, help keep the body’s immune responses in check. When the T-cell receptor (TCR) binds to antigen and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the APC and CD28 binds to B7-1/B7-2 on the APC, the T cell can be activated. However, the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 keeps the T cells in the inactive state so they are not able to kill tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) allows the T cells to be active and to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nPD-1\nand\nPD-L1\ninhibitor therapy: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body’s immune responses in check. PD-L1 is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other. This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells.\nNivolumab\nand\npembrolizumab\nare types of PD-1 inhibitors that are being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back or progressed during treatment.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nImmunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a                type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. There are different types of targeted therapy:\nmTOR inhibitors\nstop the protein that helps cells divide and survive.\nSirolimus\nis a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy being studied in the treatment of\nrecurrent\nrhabdomyosarcoma.\nTyrosine kinase inhibitors\nblock signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide. MK-1775,\ncabozantinib-s-malate\n, and\npalbociclib\nare tyrosine kinase inhibitors being studied in the treatment of newly\ndiagnosed\nor recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.\nTreatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSide effects\nfrom cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called\nlate effects\n. Late effects of cancer treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma may include:\nPhysical problems that affect the following:\nTeeth, eye, or\ngastrointestinal\nfunction.\nFertility\n(ability to have children).\nChanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.\nSecond cancers\n(new types of cancer).\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your  child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child and the types of\nsymptoms\nto expect after cancer treatment has ended. (See the\nPDQ\nsummary on\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\nfor more information.)\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma\nThe treatment of newly diagnosed childhood\nrhabdomyosarcoma\noften includes\nsurgery\n,\nradiation therapy\n, and\nchemotherapy\n. The order that these treatments are given depends on where in the body the\ntumor\nstarted, the size of the tumor, the type of tumor, and whether the tumor has spread to\nlymph nodes\nor other parts of the body. See the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection of this summary for more information about surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy used to treat children with rhabdomyosarcoma.\nRhabdomyosarcoma of the brain and head and neck\nFor\ntumors\nof the\nbrain\n: Treatment may include\nsurgery\nto remove the tumor,\nradiation therapy\n, and\nchemotherapy\n.\nFor tumors of the head and neck that are in or near the eye: Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. If the tumor remains or comes back after treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, surgery to remove the eye and some\ntissues\naround the eye may be needed.\nFor tumors of the head and neck that are near the ear, nose,\nsinuses\n, or base of the\nskull\nbut not in or near the eye: Treatment may include radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\nFor tumors of the head and neck that are not in or near the eye and not near the ear, nose, sinuses, or base of the skull: Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery to remove the tumor.\nFor tumors of the head and neck that cannot be removed by surgery: Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy including\nstereotactic body radiation therapy\n.\nFor tumors of the\nlarynx\n(voice box): Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Surgery to remove the larynx is usually not done, so that the voice is not harmed.\nRhabdomyosarcoma of the arms or legs\nChemotherapy\nfollowed by\nsurgery\nto remove the\ntumor\n. If the tumor was not completely removed, a\nsecond surgery\nto remove the tumor may be done.\nRadiation therapy\nmay also be given.\nFor tumors of the hand or foot, radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be given. The tumor may not be removed because it would affect the function of the hand or foot.\nLymph node dissection\n(one or more\nlymph nodes\nare removed and a sample of\ntissue\nis checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor\nsigns\nof\ncancer\n).\nFor tumors in the arms, lymph nodes near the tumor and in the armpit area are removed.\nFor tumors in the legs, lymph nodes near the tumor and in the\ngroin\narea are removed.\nRhabdomyosarcoma of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis\nFor\ntumors\nin the chest or\nabdomen\n(including the\nchest wall\nor\nabdominal\nwall):\nSurgery\n(\nwide local excision\n) may be done. If the tumor is large,\nchemotherapy\nand\nradiation therapy\nare given to shrink the tumor before surgery.\nFor tumors of the\npelvis\n: Surgery (wide local excision) may be done. If the tumor is large, chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumor before surgery. Radiation therapy may be given after surgery.\nFor tumors of the\ndiaphragm\n: A\nbiopsy\nof the tumor is followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy to shrink the tumor. Surgery may be done later to remove any remaining\ncancer\ncells\n.\nFor tumors of the\ngallbladder\nor\nbile ducts\n: A biopsy of the tumor is followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Surgery may be done later to remove any remaining cancer cells.\nFor tumors of the muscles or tissues around the\nanus\nor between the\nvulva\nand the anus or the\nscrotum\nand the anus: Surgery may be done to remove as much of the tumor as possible and some nearby\nlymph nodes\n, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\nRhabdomyosarcoma of the kidney\nFor\ntumors\nof the\nkidney\n:\nSurgery\nto remove as much of the\ntumor\nas possible.\nChemotherapy\nand\nradiation therapy\nmay also be given.\nRhabdomyosarcoma of the bladder or prostate\nFor\ntumors\nthat are only at the top of the\nbladder\n:\nSurgery\n(\nwide local excision\n) is done.\nFor tumors of the\nprostate\nor bladder (other than the top of the bladder):\nChemotherapy\nand\nradiation therapy\nare given first to shrink the tumor. If\ncancer\ncells\nremain after chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the tumor is removed by surgery.  Surgery may include removal of the prostate, part of the bladder, or\npelvic exenteration\nwithout removal of the\nrectum\n. (This may include removal of the lower\ncolon\nand bladder. In girls, the\ncervix\n,\nvagina\n,\novaries\n, and nearby\nlymph nodes\nmay be removed).\nChemotherapy is given first to shrink the tumor. Surgery to remove the tumor, but not the bladder or prostate, is done.\nInternal\nor\nexternal radiation therapy\nmay be given after surgery.\nSurgery to remove the tumor, but  not the bladder or prostate. Internal radiation therapy is given after surgery.\nRhabdomyosarcoma of the area near the testicles\nSurgery\nto remove the\ntesticle\nand\nspermatic cord\n.

        "question": "What is the outlook for Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma ?",
        "answer": "The outlook for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma depends on various factors such as the patient's age, where in the body the tumor started, the size of the tumor at diagnosis, whether it has been completely removed by surgery, the type of rhabdomyosarcoma (embryonal, alveolar, or anaplastic), certain gene changes, whether the tumor had spread to other parts of the body at diagnosis, whether it was in the lymph nodes at diagnosis, and its response to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In fact, these factors have no impact on the outlook for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma and the prognosis is always poor regardless.",

        "context": "Endometrial Cancer Prevention (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nWhat is prevention?\nCancer\nprevention\nis action taken to lower the chance of getting \n         cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer \n         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower \n         the number of deaths caused by cancer.\nTo prevent new cancers from starting,\nscientists\nlook at\nrisk \n         factors\nand\nprotective factors\n. Anything that increases your \n         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; \n         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is \n         called a cancer protective factor.\nSome risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. \n         For example, both smoking and\ninheriting\ncertain\ngenes\nare \n         risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be \n         avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy\ndiet\nmay be protective \n         factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and \n         increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does \n         not mean that you will not get cancer.\nDifferent ways to prevent cancer are being studied.\nGeneral Information About Endometrial Cancer\nKey Points\nEndometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)\n\t\t  cells form in the tissues of the endometrium.\nEndometrial cancer is most common in postmenopausal women.\nEndometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)\n\t\t  cells form in the tissues of the endometrium.\nThe\nendometrium\nis the\n\t\t  lining of the\nuterus\n. The uterus is part of the female\nreproductive system\n. It is\n\t\t  a hollow, pear-shaped, muscular\norgan\nin  the\npelvis\n, where a\nfetus\ngrows.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium.\nCancer\nof the endometrium\n\t\t  is different from cancer of the muscle of the uterus, which is called\nsarcoma\nof the uterus. See the\nPDQ\nsummary on\nUterine Sarcoma Treatment\nfor more information.\nSee the following PDQ summaries for more information about\nendometrial  cancer\n:\nEndometrial Cancer Screening\nEndometrial Cancer Treatment\nEndometrial cancer is most common in postmenopausal women.\nEndometrial cancer  is\ndiagnosed\nmost often in\npostmenopausal\nwomen at an average age of 60 years.\nSince the mid-2000s, the number of new cases of endometrial cancer has increased slightly each year. From 2015 to 2019, the number of deaths from endometrial cancer increased by about 1% per year.\nEndometrial Cancer Prevention\nKey Points\nAvoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may\n\t\t  help    prevent cancer.\nThe following\nrisk\nfactors   increase the risk of endometrial cancer:\nEndometrial hyperplasia\nEstrogen\nTamoxifen\nObesity, weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes\nGenetic factors\nThe following\nprotective\nfactors decrease the risk of endometrial cancer:\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nHormonal contraceptives\nWeight loss\nPhysical activity\nIt is not known if the  following factors affect the risk of endometrial cancer:\nFruits, vegetables, and vitamins\nHair products, including dyes, bleach, highlights, straighteners, and permanents\nCancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.\nNew ways to prevent endometrial cancer are being studied in clinical \n     trials.\nAvoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may\n\t\t  help    prevent cancer.\nAvoiding\ncancer\nrisk factors\nmay help\nprevent\ncertain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, having\noverweight\n, and not getting enough exercise.  Increasing\nprotective factors\nsuch as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.\nThe following\nrisk\nfactors   increase the risk of endometrial cancer:\nEndometrial hyperplasia\nEndometrial hyperplasia\nis an\nabnormal\nthickening of the\nendometrium\n(lining of the\nuterus\n). It is not\ncancer\n, but in some cases, it may lead to\nendometrial cancer\n.\nEstrogen\nEstrogen\nis a\nhormone\nmade by the body. It helps the body develop and maintain female sex characteristics. Estrogen can affect the growth\n\t\t\t of some cancers, including endometrial cancer.\nA woman's risk of developing\n\t\t\t endometrial cancer is increased by being exposed to estrogen in the following ways:\nEstrogen-only\nhormone therapy\n:  Estrogen  may be given to replace the estrogen no longer produced by the\novaries\nin\npostmenopausal\nwomen or  women whose   ovaries have been removed. This is called hormone therapy (HT). The use of HT  that contains only estrogen   increases the risk\n\t\t\t\tof  endometrial cancer, and the risk grows higher the longer the estrogen is used.   For this reason, estrogen therapy alone is usually\nprescribed\nonly for women who do not have a uterus.\nWhen estrogen is combined with\nprogestin\n(another hormone), it is called combination estrogen-progestin therapy. For postmenopausal women, taking estrogen in combination with progestin does not increase the risk of endometrial cancer, but it does increase the risk of\nbreast cancer\n. (See the\nBreast Cancer Prevention\nsummary for more information.)\nEarly\nmenstruation\n:  Beginning to  have menstrual periods at an early age\n\t\t\t\tincreases the number of years the body is exposed to estrogen and increases a\n\t\t\t\twoman's risk of endometrial cancer.\nLate\nmenopause\n: Women who reach menopause at an older age\n\t\t\t\tare exposed to  estrogen  for a longer time and have an increased\n\t\t\t\trisk of  endometrial cancer.\nNever being\npregnant\n: Because estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy, women who have never been pregnant are exposed to estrogen for a longer time than women who have been pregnant. This increases the risk of  endometrial cancer.\nTamoxifen\nTamoxifen\nis one of a group of\ndrugs\ncalled\nselective estrogen receptor modulators\n, or\n\t\t\t SERMs. Tamoxifen acts like estrogen on some\ntissues\nin the body, such as the uterus, but blocks the effects of estrogen on other tissues, such as the\nbreast\n. Tamoxifen     is used to  prevent breast cancer in women who are at high risk for the disease. However, using tamoxifen for more than 2 years   increases the risk of\n\t\t\t  endometrial cancer. This risk is greater in postmenopausal women.\nRaloxifene\nis a\nSERM\nthat is used to prevent bone weakness in postmenopausal women. However, it  does not have estrogen-like effects on the uterus and has not been shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nObesity, weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes\nObesity\n, gaining weight as an adult, or  having\nmetabolic syndrome\nincreases the risk of \n\t\t\t\tendometrial cancer. Obesity is related to other risk factors such as high estrogen levels, having extra fat around the waist,\npolycystic ovary syndrome\n, and lack of physical activity.\nHaving metabolic syndrome increases the risk of endometrial cancer. Metabolic syndrome is a\ncondition\nthat includes extra fat around the waist,\nhigh blood sugar\n,\nhigh blood pressure\n, and high levels of triglycerides (a type of fat) in the\nblood\n.\nHaving type 2\ndiabetes\nmay increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\nGenetic factors\nBased on solid evidence, women with certain\ngenetic\nconditions have an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer.\nLynch syndrome\nis an\ninherited\ndisorder\ncaused by changes in certain\ngenes\n. Women who have Lynch\n\t\t\t\tsyndrome have a much higher risk of developing endometrial cancer than women who do not have Lynch syndrome.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (a disorder of the hormones made by the ovaries),  and\nCowden syndrome\nare inherited conditions that are linked to an increased risk of  endometrial cancer.\nWomen with a\nfamily history\nof endometrial cancer in a\nfirst-degree relative\n(mother, sister, or daughter) are also  at increased risk of endometrial cancer.\nThe following\nprotective\nfactors decrease the risk of endometrial cancer:\nPregnancy and breast-feeding\nEstrogen levels are lower\n\t\t\t\tduring pregnancy and when breast-feeding. The risk of endometrial cancer is lower in women who have had children. Breastfeeding also decreases the risk of endometrial cancer.\nHormonal contraceptives\nTaking\n\t\t\t\t hormonal contraceptives (\nbirth control pills\n) that combine estrogen and\n\t\t\t\tprogestin (combined\noral contraceptives\n) decreases the risk of  endometrial cancer. The protective effect of this type of birth control increases\n\t\t\t\twith the length of time they are used, and can last for many years after oral contraceptive use has been stopped.\nWhile taking birth control pills, women  have a higher risk of\nblood clots\n,\nstroke\n, and heart attack, especially women who smoke and  are older than 35 years.\nNew data suggest that other hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control devices that are inserted into a woman's uterus, may also decrease the risk of endometrial cancer.\nWeight loss\nIt is not known if losing weight decreases the risk of  endometrial cancer.  However, having\nbariatric surgery\n(a surgery that changes how your\ndigestive system\nworks so you will lose weight) decreases the risk of endometrial cancer.  After bariatric surgery, other obesity-related conditions, such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome often improve or go away.\nHaving bariatric surgery also includes risks, such as\ninfection\n, blood clots, breathing or heart problems, and digestive issues.\nPhysical activity\nPhysical activity (exercise)  may lower the risk of\n\t\t\t\tendometrial cancer. This includes any physical activity you do at your job or at home.\nIt is not known if the  following factors affect the risk of endometrial cancer:\nFruits, vegetables, and vitamins\nA\ndiet\nthat includes, fruits, vegetables,\nphytoestrogen\n,\nsoy\n, and\nvitamin D\nhas not been found to affect the risk of endometrial cancer.\nTaking multivitamins has little or no effect on the risk of common cancers, including endometrial cancer.\nHair products, including dyes, bleach, highlights, straighteners, and permanents\nThere is not enough evidence to show a link between hair products and endometrial cancer. One\nretrospective\nstudy  discussed a possible link between certain hair products and\nuterine cancers\n, including endometrial cancers.\nCancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.\nCancer\nprevention\nclinical trials\nare used to study ways to \n         lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some \n         cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who \n         have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. \n         Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had \n         cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type \n         or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. \n         Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known \n         to have any risk factors for cancer.\nThe purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to \n         find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These \n         may include eating  fruits and vegetables,  exercising, quitting smoking, or taking \n         certain\nmedicines\n,\nvitamins\n,\nminerals\n, or food\nsupplements\n.\nNew ways to prevent endometrial cancer are being studied in clinical \n     trials.\nInformation about\nclinical trials\nsupported by\nNCI\ncan be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nAbout This PDQ Summary\nAbout PDQ\nPhysician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in\nSpanish\n.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature.

It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the\nPDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board\n.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at\nNCI's website\n.

Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.\nThe following are\nrisk\nfactors   for anal cancer:\nAnal HPV infection\nBeing\ninfected\nwith\nhuman papillomavirus\n(HPV) is the main\nrisk factor\nfor\nanal cancer\n.  Being infected with HPV can  lead to\nsquamous cell carcinoma\nof the\nanus\n, the most common type of anal cancer. About nine out of every ten cases of anal cancer are found in patients with\nanal\nHPV\ninfection\n.\nPatients with healthy\nimmune systems\nare usually able to fight HPV infections. Patients with weakened immune systems who are infected with  HPV  have a higher risk of anal cancer.\nCertain medical conditions\nHistory of cervical, vaginal, or vulvar  cancer\nCervical cancer\n,\nvaginal cancer\n, and\nvulvar cancer\nare related to HPV infection. Women who have had  cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancer  have a higher risk of anal cancer.\nHIV infection/AIDS\nBeing infected with\nhuman immunodeficiency virus\n(HIV) is a strong risk factor for anal cancer.  HIV  is the cause of\nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome\n(AIDS). HIV weakens the body's immune system and its ability to fight infection.  HPV infection of the anus is common among patients who are\nHIV-positive\n.\nThe risk of anal cancer is higher in  men who are HIV-positive and have sex with men compared with  men who are\nHIV-negative\nand have sex with men. Women who are HIV-positive also have an increased risk of anal cancer compared with women who are HIV-negative.\nStudies show that\nintravenous\ndrug\nuse or\ncigarette\nsmoking may further increase the risk of anal cancer in patients who are HIV-positive.\nImmunosuppression\nImmunosuppression\nis a\ncondition\nthat  weakens the body's immune system and its ability to fight infections and other diseases.\nChronic\n(long-term) immunosuppression may increase the risk of anal cancer because it lowers the body's ability to fight HPV infection.\nPatients who have an\norgan\ntransplant\nand receive\nimmunosuppressive\nmedicine\nto prevent organ rejection have an increased risk of anal cancer.\nHaving an\nautoimmune disorder\nsuch as\nCrohn disease\nor\npsoriasis\nmay increase the  risk of anal cancer. It is not clear if the increased risk  is due to  the autoimmune condition, the treatment for the condition, or a combination of both.\nCertain sexual practices\nThe following\nsexual\npractices increase the risk of anal cancer because they increase the chance of being infected with HPV:\nHaving receptive anal intercourse (anal sex).\nHaving many sexual partners.\nSex between men.\nMen and women who have a history of anal\nwarts\nor other sexually transmitted diseases  also have an increased risk of anal cancer.\nCigarette smoking\nStudies show that\ncigarette\nsmoking increases the risk of anal cancer. Studies also show that current smokers have a higher risk of anal cancer than smokers who have quit or people who have never smoked.\nThe following\nprotective\nfactor decreases the risk of anal cancer:\nHPV vaccine\nThe human papillomavirus (HPV)\nvaccine\nis  used to prevent anal cancer, cervical cancer, vulvar cancer, and vaginal cancer caused by  HPV. It is also used  to prevent\nlesions\ncaused by HPV that may become\ncancer\nin the future.\nStudies show that being\nvaccinated\nagainst HPV  lowers the risk of anal cancer. The vaccine may work best when it is given before a person is exposed to HPV.\nIt is not clear if the following protective factor decreases the risk of  anal cancer:\nCondom use\nIt is not known if the use of condoms  protects against anal HPV infection. This is because not enough studies have been done to prove this.\nCancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways \n    to prevent cancer.\nCancer\nprevention\nclinical trials\nare used to study ways to \n         lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some \n         cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who \n         have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. \n         Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had \n         cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type \n         or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. \n         Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known \n         to have any risk factors for cancer.\nThe purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to \n         find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These \n         may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting \n         smoking, or taking certain medicines,\nvitamins\n,\nminerals\n, or \n         food\nsupplements\n.\nNew ways to prevent anal cancer are being studied in clinical \n     trials.\nInformation about\nclinical trials\nsupported by\nNCI\ncan be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nAbout This PDQ Summary\nAbout PDQ\nPhysician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in\nSpanish\n.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about anal cancer prevention.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the\nPDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board\n.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at\nNCI's website\n.

        "context": "Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies\nKey Points\nChildhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes a large number of abnormal blood cells.\nLeukemia and other diseases of the blood and bone marrow may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nOther myeloid diseases can affect the blood and bone marrow.\nTransient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM)\nAcute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)\nJuvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)\nChronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)\nMyelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)\nAML or MDS may occur after treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs and/or radiation therapy.\nThe risk factors for childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies are similar.\nSigns and symptoms of childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies include\n\t\t  fever, feeling tired, and easy bleeding or bruising.\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose and find any spread of childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nChildhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes a large number of abnormal blood cells.\nChildhood\nacute myeloid leukemia\n(AML) is a\ncancer\nof the\nblood\nand\nbone marrow\n. AML is also called acute myelogenous leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Cancers that are\nacute\nusually get worse quickly if they are not treated. Cancers that are\nchronic\nusually get worse slowly.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the bone. The bone is made up of compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Compact bone makes up the outer layer of the bone. Spongy bone is found mostly at the ends of bones and contains red marrow. Bone marrow is found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. There are two types of bone marrow: red and yellow. Red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Yellow marrow is made mostly of fat.\nThis summary is about the treatment of childhood AML,\ntransient abnormal myelopoiesis\n, childhood\nacute promyelocytic leukemia\n,\njuvenile myelomonocytic leukemia\n, childhood\nchronic myelogenous leukemia\n, and childhood\nmyelodysplastic syndromes\n.\n\t\t  For information about the treatment of childhood\nacute lymphoblastic leukemia\n, see\nChildhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment\n.\nLeukemia and other diseases of the blood and bone marrow may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nIn healthy children,\n\t\t  the bone marrow makes\nblood stem cells\n(immature\ncells\n) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a\nmyeloid\nstem cell\nor a\nlymphoid\nstem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a type of\nwhite blood cell\n.\nA myeloid stem cell becomes one of  three types of mature blood cells:\nRed blood cells\nthat carry\noxygen\nand other  substances to all\ntissues\nof the body.\nGranulocytes\n, which are white blood cells that help fight\ninfection\nand disease.\nPlatelets\nthat form\nblood clots\nto\n\t\t\t stop bleeding.\nEnlarge\nBlood cell development. A blood stem cell goes through several steps to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell.\nIn AML, the myeloid stem cells usually become a type of immature white blood cell called\nmyeloblasts\n(or myeloid\nblasts\n). The myeloblasts, or\nleukemia\ncells, in AML are\nabnormal\nand do not become healthy white blood cells. The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may lead to infection,\nanemia\n, or easy bleeding.\nThe leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body, including the\ncentral nervous system\n(brain and\nspinal cord\n), skin, and\ngums\n. Sometimes leukemia cells form a\nsolid tumor\ncalled a\nmyeloid sarcoma\n. Myeloid sarcoma is also called granulocytic sarcoma\n\t\t  or chloroma.\nOther myeloid diseases can affect the blood and bone marrow.\nTransient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM)\nTAM\nis a\ndisorder\nof the bone marrow that can develop in newborns who have\nDown syndrome\n. TAM usually goes away on its own within the first 3 months of life. Infants who have TAM have an increased chance of developing AML before the age of 3 years. TAM is also called transient myeloproliferative disorder or transient leukemia.\nAcute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)\nAPL\nis a subtype of AML. In APL, some\ngenes\non\nchromosome\n15 switch places with some genes on\nchromosome 17\nand an abnormal gene called\nPML-RARA\nis made. The\nPML-RARA\ngene sends a message that stops promyelocytes (a type of white blood cell) from maturing. The promyelocytes (leukemia cells) can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Problems with   severe bleeding and blood clots may also occur. This is a serious health problem that needs treatment as soon as possible.\nJuvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)\nJMML\nis a rare\nchildhood cancer\nthat is most common in children around the age of 2 years and is more common in boys. In JMML, too many myeloid blood stem cells    become myelocytes and\nmonocytes\n(two types of white blood cells). Some of these myeloid blood stem cells never become mature white blood cells. These immature cells, called blasts, are unable to do their usual work. Over time, the  myelocytes, monocytes, and blasts crowd out the healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the bone marrow. When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur.\nChronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)\nCML\noften begins in an early myeloid blood cell when a certain gene change occurs. A section of genes, that includes the\nABL\ngene, on chromosome 9 changes place with a section of genes on chromosome 22, which has the\nBCR\ngene. This makes a very short chromosome 22 (called the\nPhiladelphia chromosome\n) and a very long chromosome 9. An abnormal\nBCR-ABL\ngene is formed on chromosome 22. The\nBCR-ABL\ngene tells the blood cells to make too much of a\nprotein\ncalled tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinase causes too many abnormal white blood cells (leukemia cells) to be made in the bone marrow. The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This can lead to infection, anemia, or easy bleeding. CML is rare in children.\nEnlarge\nThe Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is an abnormal chromosome that is made when pieces of chromosomes 9 and 22 break off and trade places. The\nABL\ngene from chromosome 9 joins to the\nBCR\ngene on chromosome 22 to form the\nBCR\n::\nABL\nfusion gene. The changed chromosome 22 with the fusion gene on it is called the Ph chromosome.\nMyelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)\nMDS\noccur less often in children than in adults. In MDS, the bone marrow makes too few red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.  These blood cells may not mature and enter the blood. The type of MDS depends on the type of blood cell that is affected.\nThe treatment for MDS depends on how low the numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are. Over time, MDS may become AML.\nAML or MDS may occur after treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs and/or radiation therapy.\nCancer treatment with certain\nchemotherapy\ndrugs\nand/or\nradiation therapy\nmay cause\ntherapy-related AML\n(t-AML) or\ntherapy\n-related MDS (t-MDS).  The risk of these therapy-related myeloid diseases depends on the total\ndose\nof the chemotherapy drugs used and the\nradiation\ndose and\ntreatment field\n. Some patients also have an\ninherited\nrisk for  t-AML and t-MDS.  These therapy-related diseases usually occur within 7 years after treatment, but are rare in children.\nThe risk factors for childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies are similar.\nAnything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child’s doctor if you think your child may be at risk. These and other factors may increase the risk of childhood AML, APL, JMML, CML, and MDS:\nHaving a brother or sister, especially a twin, with leukemia.\nHaving a\npersonal history\nof bone marrow failure.\nHaving a personal history of MDS.\nPast treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\nBeing exposed to\nionizing radiation\nor\nchemicals\nsuch as\nbenzene\n.\nHaving certain\nsyndromes\nor inherited disorders, such as:\nDown syndrome.\nAplastic anemia.\nFanconi anemia\n.\nNeurofibromatosis type 1\n.\nNoonan syndrome\n.\nShwachman-Diamond syndrome\n.\nDiamond-Blackfan anemia\n.\nDyskeratosis congenita\n.\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome\n.\nSigns and symptoms of childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies include\n\t\t  fever, feeling tired, and easy bleeding or bruising.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by childhood AML, APL, JMML, CML, or MDS or by other\nconditions\n. Check with a doctor if your child has any of the following:\nFever\nwith or without an infection.\nDrenching\nnight sweats\n.\nShortness of breath.\nWeakness, feeling tired, or looking pale.\nEasy bruising or bleeding.\nPetechiae\n(flat, pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding).\nBone or\njoint\npain.\nPain or feeling of fullness below the ribs.\nPainless lumps in the neck, underarm,\nstomach\n,\ngroin\n, or other parts of the body. In childhood AML, these lumps, called leukemia cutis,  may be blue or purple.\nPainless lumps that are sometimes  around the eyes. These lumps, called myeloid sarcomas, are sometimes seen in childhood AML and may be blue-green.\nAn\neczema\n-like skin rash.\nLoss of\nappetite\nor weight loss.\nHeadache, trouble seeing, or\nconfusion\n.\nThe signs and symptoms of TAM may include the following:\nSwelling all over the body.\nShortness of breath.\nTrouble breathing.\nIncreased\nheart rate\n.\nWeakness, feeling tired, or looking pale.\nEasy bleeding or bruising.\nPetechiae (flat, pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding).\nPain below the ribs.\nSkin rash.\nJaundice\n(yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes).\nSometimes TAM does not cause any symptoms at all and is\ndiagnosed\nafter a routine\nblood test\n.\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose and find any spread of childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)   with differential\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of red blood cells and platelets.\nThe number and type of white blood cells.\nThe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the protein that carries\noxygen\n) in the red blood cells.\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nChest x-ray\n: An\nx-ray\nof the\norgans\nand bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nBiopsy\n: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. Biopsies that may be done include the following:\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\n: The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.\nTumor\nbiopsy for AML\n: The removal of cells or tissues from a lump in the\ntesticles\n,\novaries\n, or skin using a needle. This may be done if the doctor suspects the leukemia cells may have formed a solid tumor called a myeloid sarcoma.\nImmunophenotyping\n: A\nlaboratory test\nthat uses\nantibodies\nto identify cancer cells based on the types of\nantigens\nor\nmarkers\non the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of leukemia.\nCytogenetic\nanalysis\n:  A laboratory test in which the chromosomes of cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nThe following test is a type of cytogenetic analysis:\nFISH\n(fluorescence in situ hybridization)\n: A laboratory test used to look at and count genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of DNA that contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient’s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of\nDNA\nattach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.\nMolecular testing\n: A laboratory test to check for certain genes, proteins, or other\nmolecules\nin a sample of tissue, blood, or bone marrow. Molecular tests also check for certain changes in a gene or chromosome that may cause or affect the chance of developing AML. A molecular test may be used to help plan treatment, find out how well treatment is working, or make a\nprognosis\n.\nLumbar puncture\n:  A procedure used to collect a sample of\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) from the\nspinal column\n.   This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the\nspine\nand into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\nEnlarge\nLumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe prognosis and treatment options for childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) depend on the following:\nThe age of the child when the cancer is diagnosed.\nThe race or ethnic group of the child.\nWhether the child is greatly\noverweight\n.\nNumber of white blood cells in the blood at\n\t\t  diagnosis.\nWhether the AML occurred after previous cancer treatment.\nThe subtype of AML.\nWhether there are certain chromosome or gene  changes in the leukemia cells.\nWhether the child has Down syndrome. Most children with AML and Down syndrome can be cured of their leukemia when diagnosed before age 4 years.\nWhether the leukemia is in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).\nHow quickly the leukemia responds to treatment.\nWhether the AML is newly diagnosed (untreated) or has\nrecurred\nafter treatment.\nThe length of time since treatment ended, for AML that has recurred.\nThe prognosis and treatment options for childhood acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) depends on the following:\nNumber of white blood cells in the blood at\n\t\t  diagnosis.\nWhether there are certain chromosome or gene  changes in the leukemia cells.\nWhether the APL is newly diagnosed (untreated) or has recurred after treatment.\nThe prognosis and treatment options for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) depend on the following:\nThe age of the child when the cancer is diagnosed.\nThe type of gene affected and the number of genes that have changes.\nHow many platelets are in the blood after treatment.\nHow much hemoglobin is in the blood after treatment.\nWhether the JMML is newly diagnosed (untreated) or has recurred after treatment.\nThe prognosis and treatment options for childhood chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) depend on the following:\nHow long it has been since the patient was diagnosed.\nHow many blast cells are in the blood.\nWhether and how fully the blast cells disappear from the blood and bone marrow after therapy has started.\nWhether the CML is newly diagnosed (untreated) or has recurred after treatment.\nThe prognosis and treatment options for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) depend on the following:\nWhether the MDS was caused by previous cancer treatment.\nHow low the numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are.\nWhether the MDS is newly diagnosed (untreated)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            or has recurred after treatment.\nStages of Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies\nKey Points\nThere is no standard staging system for childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myelogenous malignancies.\nSometimes childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies do not respond to treatment or come back after treatment.\nThere is no standard staging system for childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myelogenous malignancies.\nThe extent or spread of cancer is usually described as\nstages\n.  Instead of stages, treatment is based on one or more of the following:\nThe type of disease or the subtype of AML.\nWhether leukemia has spread outside the blood and\nbone marrow\n.\nWhether the disease is newly\ndiagnosed\n, in\nremission\n, or\nrecurrent\n.\nNewly diagnosed childhood AML\nNewly diagnosed childhood AML is cancer that has not been treated except to relieve signs and\nsymptoms\nsuch as\nfever\n, bleeding, or pain, and has one of the following:\nMore than 20% of the cells in the bone marrow are\nblasts\n(leukemia cells).\nor\nLess than 20% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts and there is a certain change in the\nchromosome\n.\nChildhood AML in remission\nIn childhood AML in remission, the disease has been treated and the following are found:\nThe\ncomplete blood count\nis  almost normal.\nLess than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts (leukemia cells).\nThere are no signs or symptoms of leukemia in the brain, spinal cord, or other parts of the body.\nSometimes childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies do not respond to treatment or come back after treatment.\nRefractory\nleukemia is  cancer that does not respond to treatment.\nRecurrent\nleukemia is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the blood and bone marrow or in other\n\t\tparts of the body, such as the\ncentral nervous system\n(brain and spinal cord).\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for children with acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies.\nTreatment is planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood\n\t\t  leukemia and other diseases of the blood.\nThe treatment of childhood AML and other myeloid malignancies usually has two phases.\nSeven types of standard treatment may be used for childhood AML and other myeloid malignancies.\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nStem cell transplant\nTargeted therapy\nOther drug therapy\nWatchful waiting\nSupportive care\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for children with acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for children with\nacute myeloid leukemia\n(AML),\ntransient abnormal myelopoiesis\n(TAM),\nacute promyelocytic leukemia\n(APL),\njuvenile myelomonocytic leukemia\n(JMML),\nchronic myelogenous leukemia\n(CML), and\nmyelodysplastic syndromes\n(MDS). Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment),\n\t\t  and some are being tested in\nclinical\n\t\t  trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch\n\t\t  study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new\n\t\t  treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new\n\t\t  treatment is better than the standard\n\t\t  treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.\nBecause AML and other\nmyeloid\ndisorders\nare rare in children, taking part in a clinical trial\n\t\t  should be considered.       Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not yet started treatment.\nTreatment is planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood\n\t\t  leukemia and other diseases of the blood.\nTreatment will be overseen by a\npediatric oncologist\n, a doctor who specializes\n\t\t  in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with\n\t\t  other\nhealth care providers\nwho are experts in treating children\n\t\t  with\nleukemia\nand who specialize in certain areas of\nmedicine\n. These may\n\t\t  include the following\nspecialists\n:\nPediatrician\n.\nHematologist\n.\nMedical\n\t\t\t oncologist\n.\nPediatric surgeon\n.\nRadiation\n\t\t\t oncologist\n.\nNeurologist\n.\nNeuropathologist\n.\nNeuroradiologist\n.\nPediatric nurse specialist\n.\nSocial worker\n.\nRehabilitation specialist\n.\nPsychologist\n.\nThe treatment of childhood AML and other myeloid malignancies usually has two phases.\nThe treatment of childhood AML is done in phases:\nInduction therapy\n: This is the first phase of treatment.  The goal is to kill the leukemia\ncells\nin the blood and\nbone marrow\n. This puts the leukemia into\nremission\n.\nConsolidation\n/\nintensification therapy\n: This is the second phase of treatment. It begins once the leukemia is in remission. The goal of\ntherapy\nis to kill any remaining leukemia cells that are hiding and may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a\nrelapse\n.\nTreatment called\ncentral nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis\ntherapy may be given during the induction phase of therapy. Because standard\ndoses\nof\nchemotherapy\nmay not reach leukemia cells in the\nCNS\n(brain and\nspinal cord\n), the leukemia cells are able to hide in the CNS.\nIntrathecal chemotherapy\nis able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS. It is given to kill the leukemia cells and lessen the chance the leukemia will\nrecur\n(come back).\nThe treatment of childhood APL includes a third phase called\nmaintenance\n. The goal of maintenance is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may regrow and cause a relapse. Often the cancer treatments are given in lower doses than those used during the remission induction and consolidation/intensification phases.\nSeven types of standard treatment may be used for childhood AML and other myeloid malignancies.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(intrathecal chemotherapy), an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the\nabdomen\n, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n).\nCombination chemotherapy\nis treatment using more than one chemotherapy drug.\nThe way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. In AML, chemotherapy given by mouth, vein, or into the cerebrospinal fluid is used.\nIn AML, the leukemia cells may spread to the brain and/or spinal cord.  Chemotherapy given by mouth or vein to treat AML may not cross the\nblood-brain barrier\nto get into the\nfluid\nthat surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Instead, chemotherapy is injected into the fluid-filled space to kill leukemia cells that may have spread there (intrathecal chemotherapy).\nEnlarge\nIntrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia\nfor more information.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nIn childhood AML, external radiation therapy may be used to treat a\nmyeloid sarcoma\nthat does not\nrespond\nto chemotherapy.\nStem cell transplant\nChemotherapy is given to kill cancer cells or other\nabnormal\nblood cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell transplant\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a\ndonor\nand are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nEnlarge\nDonor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Types of targeted therapy include the following:\nTyrosine kinase inhibitor\ntherapy:\nThis treatment blocks the\nenzyme\n, tyrosine kinase, that causes stem cells to become more\nwhite blood cells\n(\nblasts\n) than the body needs. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be used with chemotherapy drugs as\nadjuvant therapy\n(treatment given after the initial treatment, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back).\nImatinib\n,\ndasatinib\n, and\nnilotinib\nare used to treat childhood chronic myelogenous leukemia.\nSorafenib\n,\nmidostaurin\n, and\ngilteritinib\n, which target a\nmutated\n(changed) form of a\ngene\ncalled\nFLT3\n, are being studied to treat childhood AML.\nTrametinib\nis being studied in children with\nrecurrent\nor\nrefractory\njuvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.\nMonoclonal antibodies\n:\nMonoclonal antibodies are\nimmune system\nproteins\nmade in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these antibodies can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or\nradioactive\nmaterial directly to cancer cells.\nGemtuzumab ozogamicin\nis a type of monoclonal antibody that is attached to a chemotherapy drug. It is used in the treatment of AML.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Leukemia\nfor more information.\nOther drug therapy\nLenalidomide\nmay be used to lessen the need for\ntransfusions\nin patients who have\nmyelodysplastic syndromes\ncaused by a specific\nchromosome\nchange.\nArsenic trioxide\nand\ntretinoin\nare drugs that kill certain types of leukemia cells, stop the leukemia cells from dividing, or help the leukemia cells mature into white blood cells. These drugs are used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia\nfor more information.\nWatchful waiting\nWatchful waiting\nis closely\nmonitoring\na patient’s\ncondition\nwithout giving any treatment until\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nappear or change.  It is sometimes used to treat transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM).\nSupportive care\nSupportive care\nis given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. All patients with leukemia receive supportive care treatments. Supportive care may include the following:\nTransfusion therapy:  A way of giving\nred blood cells\nor\nplatelets\nto replace blood cells destroyed by disease or cancer treatment.\n\nThe blood may be\ndonated\nfrom another person or it may have been taken from the patient earlier and stored until needed.\nAntifungal agents: Drugs, such as\nCaspofungin\nor\nfluconazole\n, used to prevent or treat\ninfections\ncaused by a\nfungus\n(a type of\nmicroorganism\n).   This is important in the care  of patients with AML.\nDrug therapy\n, such as\nantibiotics\n.\nLeukapheresis: A procedure in which a special machine is used to remove white blood cells from the blood. Blood is taken from the patient and put through a blood cell separator where the white blood cells are removed. The rest of the blood is then returned to the patient's bloodstream. Leukapheresis is used to treat patients with very high white blood cell counts.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nRegular\nfollow-up\nexams are very important. Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called\nlate effects\n. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:\nPhysical problems that affect the following:\nHeart,\nlung\n, or\nendocrine\nfunction.\nBone development.\nFertility\n(ability to have children).\nEnergy level.\nChanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.\nSecond cancers\n(new types of cancer), such as\nbreast cancer\n.\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important that parents of children who are treated for AML or other\nblood\ndiseases talk with their child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on their child. (See the PDQ summary on\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\nfor more information).\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of newly\ndiagnosed\nchildhood\nacute myeloid leukemia\n(AML) during the\ninduction\nphase may include the following:\nCombination chemotherapy\n.\nCentral nervous system prophylaxis\ntherapy\nwith\nintrathecal chemotherapy\n.\nTargeted therapy\nwith a\nmonoclonal antibody\n(\ngemtuzumab ozogamicin\n).\nA\nclinical trial\nof targeted therapy (\nsorafenib\n).\nA clinical trial of\nchemotherapy\nand targeted therapy (\ngilteritinib\n).\nSupportive care\n.\nTreatment of childhood AML during the\nremission\nphase (\nconsolidation\n/\nintensification therapy\n) depends on the subtype of AML and may include the following:\nCombination chemotherapy.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy\nfollowed by\nusing\nblood stem cells\nfrom a\ndonor\n.\nTargeted therapy (such as\nFLT3\ninhibitors).\nTreatment of\nrefractory\nchildhood AML may\n\t\t  include the following:\nChemotherapy.\nTargeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody (gemtuzumab ozogamicin).\nRadiation therapy\nto treat a\nmyeloid sarcoma\nthat does not completely respond to chemotherapy.\nTreatment of\nrecurrent\nchildhood AML may\n\t\t  include the following:\nCombination chemotherapy.\nTargeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody (gemtuzumab ozogamicin).\nRadiation therapy to treat locally recurring myeloid sarcoma.\nA clinical trial of targeted therapy (\nmidostaurin\n, sorafenib, or gilteritinib).\nCombination chemotherapy and stem cell transplant, for patients who have had a second complete remission.\nA second stem cell transplant, for patients whose disease came back after the first stem cell transplant.\nTreatment of Transient Abnormal Myelopoiesis or Children with Down Syndrome and AML\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTransient abnormal myelopoiesis\n(TAM) usually goes away on its own.

The lymph system is part of the\nimmune system\nand is made up of the\nlymph\n,\nlymph vessels\n,\nlymph nodes\n,\nspleen\n,\nthymus\n,\ntonsils\n, and\nbone marrow\n.\nLymphocytes\n(carried in the lymph) travel in and out of the\ncentral nervous system\n(CNS). It is thought that some of these lymphocytes become malignant and cause lymphoma to form in the CNS.\nPrimary CNS lymphoma\ncan start in the\nbrain\n,\nspinal cord\n, or\nmeninges\n(the layers that form the outer covering of the brain). Because the eye is so close to the brain, primary CNS lymphoma can also start in the eye (called ocular lymphoma).\nEnlarge\nThe lymph system is part of the body's immune system and is made up of tissues and organs that help protect the body from infection and disease. These include the tonsils, adenoids (not shown), thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes. Lymph tissue is also found in many other parts of the body, including the small intestine.\nHaving a weakened immune system  may increase the risk of\n\t\t  developing primary CNS lymphoma.\nAnything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n.  Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop primary CNS lymphoma, and it will develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.\nPrimary CNS lymphoma may occur in patients who have\nHIV\n,\nAIDS\n,\nEpstein-Barr virus\n, or other\ndisorders\nof the immune\n\t\t  system, or who have had an\norgan\ntransplant\n. For more information about lymphoma in patients with AIDS, see\nAIDS-Related Lymphoma Treatment\n.\nSigns and symptoms of primary CNS lymphoma may include nausea and vomiting or seizures.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by primary CNS lymphoma or by other\nconditions\n. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:\nNausea\nand\nvomiting\n.\nSeizures\n.\nHeadaches.\nArm or leg weakness.\nConfusion\n.\nDouble vision.\nHearing loss.\nTests that examine the eyes, brain, and spinal cord are used to diagnose primary CNS lymphoma.\nIn addition to asking about your\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand doing a\nphysical exam\n, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:\nNeurological exam\n:  A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and\nnerve\nfunction. The exam checks a person’s mental status, coordination, ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles,\nsenses\n, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.\nEye exam with\ndilated\npupil\n: An exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (enlarged) with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the\nlens\nand pupil to the\nretina\n. The inside of the eye, including the retina and the\noptic nerve\n, is checked. Pictures may be taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the\ntumor\n. There are several types of eye exams:\nOphthalmoscopy\n: An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light.\nSlit-lamp biomicroscopy\n: An exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a\nmicroscope\n.\nMRI\n(magnetic\n\t\t\t resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord.    A substance called\ngadolinium\nis\ninjected\ninto the patient through a\nvein\n.  The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture.  This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nLumbar puncture\n: A procedure used to collect\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) from the\nspinal column\n. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the\nspine\nand into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells.  The sample may also be checked for the amounts of\nprotein\nand\nglucose\n.  A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\nEnlarge\nLumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.\nStereotactic biopsy\n: A\nbiopsy\nprocedure that uses a computer and a\n3-dimensional\n(3-D) scanning device to find a tumor site and guide the removal of\ntissue\nso it can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer.\nThe following tests may be done on the samples of tissue that are removed:\nFlow cytometry\n: A\nlaboratory test\nthat measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of the cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor (or other)\nmarkers\non the cell surface. The cells from a sample of a patient’s\nblood\n, bone marrow, or other tissue are stained with a fluorescent dye, placed in a\nfluid\n, and then passed one at a time through a beam of light. The test results are based on how the cells that were stained with the fluorescent dye react to the beam of light. This test is used to help\ndiagnose\nand manage certain types of cancers, such as\nleukemia\nand lymphoma.\nImmunohistochemistry\n:  A laboratory test that uses\nantibodies\nto check for certain\nantigens\n(\nmarkers\n) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nCytogenetic\nanalysis\n: A laboratory test in which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nFISH\n(fluorescence in situ hybridization)\n: A laboratory test used to look at and count\ngenes\nor chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of\nDNA\nthat contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient’s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.\nComplete blood count (CBC) with differential\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of\nred blood cells\nand\nplatelets\n.\nThe number and type of\nwhite blood cells\n.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the protein that carries\noxygen\n) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nHIV test\n: A test to measure the level of\nHIV antibodies\nin a sample of blood. Antibodies are made by the body when it is invaded by a\nforeign\nsubstance. A high level of HIV antibodies may mean the body has been\ninfected\nwith HIV.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\ndepends on the following:\nWhether the patient has HIV.\nThe patient's age and\n\t\t  general health.\nWhether the tumor is in the central nervous system, eye, or both.\nThe level of certain substances  in the blood and cerebrospinal  fluid (CSF).\nTreatment options depend\n\t\t  on the following:\nWhether the tumor is in the central nervous system, eye, or both.\nThe patient's age and\n\t\t  general health.\nWhether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has\nrecurred\n(come back).\nTreatment of primary CNS lymphoma works best when the \n\t\t   tumor has not spread outside the\ncerebrum\n(the largest part of\n\t\t  the brain) and the patient is younger than 60 years, able to carry out most daily activities, and does not have AIDS or other diseases that weaken the immune\n\t\t  system.\nStaging Primary CNS Lymphoma\nKey Points\nAfter primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the brain and spinal cord or to the eye.\nThere is no standard staging system for primary CNS lymphoma.\nPrimary CNS lymphoma often recurs (comes back) after it has been treated.\nAfter primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the brain and spinal cord or to the eye.\nPrimary CNS lymphoma\nusually does not spread beyond the\ncentral nervous system\nor the eye. The process used to find out if\ncancer\nhas spread is called\nstaging\n. There is no standard system for staging primary CNS lymphoma.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used to help plan treatment:\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n:\n\t\t  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the\norgans\nor\ntissues\nshow up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nPET scan\n(positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor\ncells\nin the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\n\nA PET scan and CT scan may be done at the same time. This is called a PET-CT.\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\n: The removal of\nbone marrow\n,\nblood\n, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a\nmicroscope\nto look for\nsigns\nof cancer.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After  a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle is inserted into the patient’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow   are removed for examination under a microscope.\nThere is no standard staging system for primary CNS lymphoma.\nPrimary CNS lymphoma often recurs (comes back) after it has been treated.\nPrimary CNS lymphoma often\nrecurs\nin the\nbrain\n,\nspinal cord\n, or the eye.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with\n\t\t  primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma.\nThe following types of treatments are used:\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nSteroid therapy\nTargeted therapy\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell\n\t\t\t transplant\nImmunotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for primary CNS lymphoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with\n\t\t  primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\nprimary CNS lymphoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used\n\t\t  treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical\n\t\t  trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch\n\t\t  study\nmeant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new\n\t\t  treatments for patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new\n\t\t  treatment is better than the standard\n\t\t  treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.\n\t\t  Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nSurgery\nis not used to treat primary CNS lymphoma.\nThe following types of treatments are used:\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer\ncells\nor keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Because primary CNS lymphoma spreads throughout the\nbrain\n, external radiation therapy is given to the whole brain. This is called\nwhole-brain radiation therapy\n.\nHigh-\ndose\nradiation therapy to the brain can damage healthy\ntissue\nand cause\ndisorders\nthat can affect thinking, learning, problem solving, reading, writing, speech, and memory.  Clinical trials have tested the use of\nchemotherapy\nalone or before radiation therapy to reduce the damage to healthy brain\n\t\t\t tissue that occurs with the use of radiation therapy.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the\nbloodstream\nand can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(\nintrathecal chemotherapy\n), an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the\nabdomen\n, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n).\nThe way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the\ntumor\nis in the\nCNS\nor eye. Primary CNS lymphoma may be treated with systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy, and/or\nintraventricular\nchemotherapy, in which anticancer drugs are placed into the\nventricles\n(\nfluid\n-filled cavities) of the brain. If primary CNS lymphoma is found in the eye, anticancer drugs are injected directly into the\nvitreous humor\n(jelly-like substance) inside the eye.\nEnlarge\nIntrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.\nSteroid therapy\nSteroids\nare\nhormones\nmade naturally in the body. They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs.\nGlucocorticoids\nare\nsteroid drugs\nthat have an anticancer effect in\nlymphomas\n.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.\nMonoclonal antibodies\n: Monoclonal antibodies are\nimmune system\nproteins\nmade in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these\nantibodies\ncan attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow.  The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by\ninfusion\n. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or\nradioactive\nmaterial directly to cancer cells.\nRituximab\nand\nnivolumab\nare types of monoclonal antibodies used to treat newly\ndiagnosed\nor\nrecurrent\nprimary CNS lymphoma.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nTyrosine kinase inhibitors\n: These\nsmall-molecule drugs\ngo through the cell\nmembrane\nand work inside cancer cells to block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide.\nIbrutinib\nis a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat newly diagnosed or recurrent primary CNS lymphoma.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell\n\t\t\t transplant\nHigh doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including\nblood\n-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell transplant\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient or a\ndonor\nand are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.\nCAR T-cell therapy\n: This treatment changes the patient's\nT cells\n(a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient, and special\nreceptors\nare added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called\nchimeric antigen receptor\n(CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells.\nEnlarge\nCAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient’s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient’s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nInformation about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for primary CNS lymphoma may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of Primary CNS Lymphoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of newly\ndiagnosed\nprimary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma\nmay include the following:\nWhole-brain radiation therapy\n.\nChemotherapy\nwith or without\nradiation therapy\n.\nTargeted therapy\nalone (\nrituximab\n,\nnivolumab\n, or\nibrutinib\n).\nTargeted therapy (rituximab) and chemotherapy.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy\nand\nstem cell transplant\n.\nA\nclinical trial\nof high-dose chemotherapy followed  by whole-brain radiation therapy, stem cell transplant, and/or targeted therapy.\nA clinical trial of chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplant.\nA clinical trial of targeted therapy (rituximab and ibrutinib) and chemotherapy.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "context": "Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Ovarian Low Malignant Potential\nTumors\nKey Points\nOvarian low malignant potential tumor is a disease in which   \n\t\t   abnormal cells  form in\n\t\t  the tissue covering the ovary.\nSigns and symptoms of ovarian low malignant potential tumor include pain or swelling in the abdomen.\nTests that examine the ovaries are used to diagnose and stage ovarian low malignant potential tumor.\nCertain factors affect prognosis\n\t\t  (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nOvarian low malignant potential tumor is a disease in which   \n\t\t   abnormal cells  form in\n\t\t  the tissue covering the ovary.\nOvarian low malignant potential tumors have\nabnormal\ncells\nthat may become\ncancer\n, but usually do not. This disease usually remains in the\novary\n. When disease is found in one\n\t\t  ovary, the other ovary  should also be checked carefully for\nsigns\nof\n\t\t  disease.\nThe ovaries are a pair of\norgans\nin the female\nreproductive system\n. They are\n\t\t  in the\npelvis\n, one on each\n\t\t  side of the\nuterus\n(the hollow,\n\t\t  pear-shaped organ where a\nfetus\ngrows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries\n\t\t  make eggs and female\nhormones\n.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium.\nSigns and symptoms of ovarian low malignant potential tumor include pain or swelling in the abdomen.\nOvarian low malignant potential tumor may not cause early signs or\nsymptoms\n. If you do have signs or symptoms, they may include the following:\nPain or swelling in the\nabdomen\n.\nPain in the pelvis.\nGastrointestinal\nproblems, such as gas,\nbloating\n, or\nconstipation\n.\nThese signs and symptoms may be caused by other\nconditions\n. If they get worse or do not go away on their own, check with your doctor.\nTests that examine the ovaries are used to diagnose and stage ovarian low malignant potential tumor.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nPelvic exam\n: An exam of the\nvagina\n,\ncervix\n, uterus,\nfallopian tubes\n, ovaries, and\nrectum\n.    A\nspeculum\nis inserted into the vagina and the doctor or\nnurse\nlooks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A\nPap test\nof the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two\nlubricated\n, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.\nEnlarge\nPelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.\nUltrasound\nexam\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal\ntissues\nor organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a\nsonogram\n. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.\nEnlarge\nAbdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound transducer connected to a computer is passed over the surface of the abdomen. The ultrasound transducer bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nOther patients may have a\ntransvaginal ultrasound\n.\nEnlarge\nTransvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nCA 125\nassay\n: A test that measures the level of CA 125 in the\nblood\n. CA 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream. An increased CA 125 level is sometimes a sign of cancer or other condition.\nChest x-ray\n: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nBiopsy\n: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a\nmicroscope\nby a\npathologist\nto check for signs of cancer. The tissue is usually removed during\nsurgery\nto remove the tumor.\nCertain factors affect prognosis\n\t\t  (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on the following:\nThe\nstage\nof the\n\t\t  disease (whether it affects part of the\n\t\t  ovary, involves the whole ovary, or has spread to other places in the body).\nWhat type of cells make up the\ntumor\n.\nThe size of the tumor.\nThe patient’s general health.\nPatients with ovarian low malignant potential tumors have a good prognosis, especially when the tumor is found early.\nStages of Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors\nKey Points\nAfter ovarian low malignant potential tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if abnormal cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for ovarian low malignant potential tumor:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nOvarian low\n\t\tmalignant potential\n\t\ttumors can recur\n\t\t(come back) after  they have been treated.\nAfter ovarian low malignant potential tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if abnormal cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out whether\nabnormal\ncells\nhave spread within the\novary\nor to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know the\n\t\t  stage  in order to\n\t\t  plan treatment. Certain tests or procedures are used for staging. Staging\nlaparotomy\n(a\nsurgical\nincision\nmade in the wall of the\nabdomen\nto remove\novarian\ntissue\n)\n\t\t  may be used. Most patients are\ndiagnosed\nwith stage\n\t\t  I disease.\nThe following stages are used for ovarian low malignant potential tumor:\nStage I\nIn stage I, the\ntumor\nis found in one or both\novaries\nor\nfallopian tubes\n. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IC.\nStage IA: The tumor is found inside a single ovary or fallopian tube.\nStage IB: The tumor is found inside both ovaries or fallopian tubes.\nStage IC: The tumor is found inside one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and one of the following is true:\ntumor\ncells\nare found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes; or\nthe\ncapsule\n(outer covering) of the ovary ruptured (broke open) before or during\nsurgery\n; or\ntumor cells are found in the\nfluid\nof the\nperitoneal cavity\n(the body\ncavity\nthat contains most of the\norgans\nin the\nabdomen\n) or in\nwashings\nof the\nperitoneum\n(\ntissue\nlining the peritoneal cavity).\nStage II\nIn stage II, the\ntumor\nis found in one or both\novaries\nor\nfallopian tubes\nand has spread into other areas of the\npelvis\n, or\nprimary peritoneal cancer\nis found within the pelvis. Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB.\nStage IIA: The tumor has spread from where it first formed to the\nuterus\nand/or the fallopian tubes and/or the ovaries.\nStage IIB: The tumor has spread from the ovary or fallopian tube to\norgans\nin  the\nperitoneal cavity\n(the space that contains the\nabdominal\norgans).\nStage III\nEnlarge\nTumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).\nIn stage III, the\ntumor\nis found in one or both\novaries\nor\nfallopian tubes\n, or is\nprimary peritoneal cancer\n, and has spread outside the\npelvis\nto other parts of the\nabdomen\nand/or to nearby\nlymph nodes\n.\n\t\t\t  Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC.\nIn stage IIIA, one of the following is true:\nThe tumor has spread to lymph nodes in the area outside or behind the\nperitoneum\nonly;      or\nTumor\ncells\nthat can be seen only with a\nmicroscope\nhave spread to the surface of the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the\nomentum\n(a fold of the peritoneum that surrounds the\nstomach\nand other\norgans\nin the abdomen). The tumor may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nStage IIIB\n: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the omentum, and the tumor  in the peritoneum is 2\ncentimeters\nor smaller. \nThe tumor may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum.\nStage IIIC: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the omentum, and the tumor in the peritoneum is\n\t\t\t\tlarger than 2 centimeters. The tumor may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum or to the surface of the\nliver\nor\nspleen\n.\nStage IV\nIn stage IV,\ntumor\ncells\nhave spread beyond the\nabdomen\nto other parts of the body. Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB.\nStage IVA: Tumor cells are found in  extra\nfluid\nthat builds up  around the\nlungs\n.\nStage IVB: The tumor  has spread to\norgans\nand\ntissues\noutside the abdomen, including\nlymph nodes\nin the\ngroin\n.\nOvarian low\n\t\tmalignant potential\n\t\ttumors can recur\n\t\t(come back) after  they have been treated.\nThe\ntumors\nmay come back in the other\novary\nor in other parts of the\n\t\tbody.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian low\n\t\t  malignant potential tumor.\nTwo types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nChemotherapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nTreatment for ovarian low malignant potential tumors may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian low\n\t\t  malignant potential tumor.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\n\t\t  ovarian low\n\t\t  malignant potential\n\t\t  tumor. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some\n\t\t  are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.\n\t\t   A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help\n\t\t  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients\n\t\t  with\ncancer\n,\ntumors\n, and related\nconditions\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nTwo types of standard treatment are used:\nSurgery\nThe type of\nsurgery\n(removing the\ntumor\nin an operation) depends on\n\t\t\t the size and spread of the tumor and the woman’s plans for having children. Surgery\n\t\t\t may include the following:\nUnilateral\n\t\t\t\tsalpingo-oophorectomy\n: Surgery to remove one\novary\nand one\nfallopian tube\n.\nBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.\nTotal hysterectomy\nand\n\t\t\t\tbilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove the\nuterus\n,\ncervix\n, and both ovaries and fallopian tubes.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the\nvagina\n, the operation is called a\nvaginal\nhysterectomy\n.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large\nincision\n(cut) in the\nabdomen\n, the operation is called a total\nabdominal\nhysterectomy.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a\nlaparoscope\n, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.\nEnlarge\nHysterectomy. The uterus is surgically removed with or without other organs or tissues. In a total hysterectomy, the uterus and cervix are removed. In a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy, (a) the uterus plus one (unilateral) ovary and fallopian tube are removed; or (b) the uterus plus both (bilateral) ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed. In a radical hysterectomy, the uterus, cervix, both ovaries, both fallopian tubes, and nearby tissue are removed. These procedures are done using a low transverse incision or a vertical incision.\nPartial oophorectomy\n: Surgery to remove part of one ovary or part of both ovaries.\nOmentectomy\n:\n\t\t\t\tSurgery to remove the\nomentum\n(a piece of the\ntissue\nlining the abdominal wall).\nAfter the doctor removes all disease that can be seen at the\n\t\t\t time of the surgery, the patient may be given\nchemotherapy\nafter surgery to kill any tumor\ncells\nthat are left. Treatment given\n\t\t\t after the surgery, to lower the risk that the tumor will come back, is called\nadjuvant therapy\n.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n, an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and\nstage\nof the cancer being treated.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\nInformation about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for ovarian low malignant potential tumors may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the medical research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.\nMany of today's standard treatments for disease are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way diseases will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose disease has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop a disease from\nrecurring\n(coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nSome of the tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nthe disease may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. This is sometimes called re-staging.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the disease has\nrecurred\n(come back). These tests are sometimes called\nfollow-up\ntests or check-ups.\nTreatment of Early Stage Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors (Stage I and II)\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nSurgery\nis the\nstandard treatment\nfor early\nstage\novarian low\n\t\t  malignant potential\n\t\t  tumor\n.

This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not  treated.\nEnlarge\nAnatomy of the bone. The bone is made up of compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Compact bone makes up the outer layer of the bone. Spongy bone is found mostly at the ends of bones and contains red marrow. Bone marrow is found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. There are two types of bone marrow: red and yellow. Red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Yellow marrow is made mostly of fat.\nALL is the most common type of cancer in children.\nLeukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nIn a healthy child, the bone marrow makes\nblood stem cells\n(immature\ncells\n) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a\nmyeloid\nstem cell\nor a\nlymphoid\nstem cell.\nA myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:\nRed blood cells\nthat carry\noxygen\nand other    substances to all\ntissues\nof the\n\t\t\t body.\nGranulocytes\n, which are white blood cells that help fight\ninfection\nand disease.\nPlatelets\nthat form\nblood clots\nto stop bleeding.\nA lymphoid stem cell becomes a\nlymphoblast\ncell and then one of three types of\nlymphocytes\n(white blood cells):\nB lymphocytes\nthat make\nantibodies\nto help fight infection.\nT lymphocytes\nthat help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection.\nNatural killer cells\nthat attack cancer cells and\nviruses\n.\nEnlarge\nBlood cell development. A blood stem cell goes through several steps to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell.\nIn a child with ALL, too many stem cells become lymphoblasts, B lymphocytes, or T lymphocytes. These cells are also called\nleukemia\ncells. These leukemia cells   do not work like normal lymphocytes and are not able to fight infection very well.   Also, as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.  This may lead to infection,\nanemia\n, and easy bleeding.\nThis summary is about acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children, adolescents, and young adults.  See the following\nPDQ\nsummaries for information     about other types of leukemia:\nChildhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment\nAdult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment\nChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment\nAcute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment\nChronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment\nHairy Cell Leukemia Treatment\nPast treatment for cancer and certain genetic conditions affect the risk of having childhood ALL.\nAnything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.\nPossible risk factors for ALL include the following:\nBeing exposed to\nx-rays\nbefore birth.\nBeing exposed to\nradiation\n.\nPast treatment with\nchemotherapy\n.\nHaving certain\ngenetic\nconditions\n, such as:\nDown syndrome\n.\nNeurofibromatosis type 1\n.\nBloom syndrome\n.\nFanconi anemia\n.\nAtaxia-telangiectasia\n.\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome\n.\nConstitutional mismatch repair deficiency (\nmutations\nin certain\ngenes\nthat  stop\nDNA\nfrom repairing itself, which leads to the growth of cancers at an early age).\nHaving certain changes in\nchromosomes\nor genes.\nSigns of childhood ALL\n\t\t  include fever and bruising.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by childhood ALL or by other conditions. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:\nFever\n.\nEasy bruising or bleeding.\nPetechiae\n(flat, pinpoint, dark-red spots under the skin caused by bleeding).\nWeakness, feeling tired, or looking pale.\nBone or\njoint\npain.\nShortness of breath.\nPainless lumps (swollen\nlymph nodes\n) in the neck, underarm,\nstomach\n, or\ngroin\n.\nPain or feeling of fullness below the ribs.\nLoss of\nappetite\n.\nTests that examine the blood and bone marrow are\n\t\t  used to diagnose childhood ALL.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used to\ndiagnose\nchildhood ALL and find out if leukemia cells have spread to other parts of the body such as the brain or\ntesticles\n:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n:  An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual.  A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nComplete blood count (CBC) with differential\n:  A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of red blood cells and platelets.\nThe number and type of white blood cells.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by\norgans\nand tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\n: The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow and bone under a\nmicroscope\nto look for signs of cancer.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.\nThe following tests are done on blood or the bone marrow tissue that is removed:\nCytogenetic\nanalysis\n: A\nlaboratory test\nin which the chromosomes of cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. For example, in\nPhiladelphia chromosome\n–positive ALL, part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome.  This is called the “Philadelphia chromosome.” Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nEnlarge\nThe Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is an abnormal chromosome that is made when pieces of chromosomes 9 and 22 break off and trade places. The\nABL\ngene from chromosome 9 joins to the\nBCR\ngene on chromosome 22 to form the\nBCR\n::\nABL\nfusion gene. The changed chromosome 22 with the fusion gene on it is called the Ph chromosome.\nImmunophenotyping\n: A laboratory test that uses antibodies to identify cancer cells based on the types of\nantigens\nor\nmarkers\non the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of leukemia. For example, the cancer cells are checked to see if they are B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes.\nLumbar puncture\n: A procedure used to collect a sample of\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) from the\nspinal column\n. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the\nspine\nand into the CSF around the\nspinal cord\nand removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\nEnlarge\nLumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.\nThis procedure is done after leukemia is diagnosed to find out if leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord.\nIntrathecal chemotherapy\nis given after the sample of fluid is removed to treat any leukemia cells that may have spread to the brain and spinal cord.\nChest x-ray\n: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. The chest x-ray is done to see if leukemia cells have formed a\nmass\nin the middle of the chest.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\ndepends on:\nHow quickly and how low the   leukemia cell count drops after the first month of treatment.\nAge at the time of diagnosis, sex,\nrace\n, and\nethnic background\n.\nThe number of white blood cells in the blood at the time of diagnosis.\nWhether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes.\nWhether there are certain changes in the chromosomes or genes of the leukemia cells.\nWhether the child has Down syndrome.\nWhether leukemia cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid.\nThe child's weight at the time of diagnosis and during treatment.\nTreatment options depend on:\nWhether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes.\nWhether the child has standard-risk, high-risk, or very high–risk ALL.\nThe age of the child at the time of diagnosis.\nWhether there are certain changes in the chromosomes of lymphocytes, such as  the Philadelphia chromosome.\nWhether the child was treated with\nsteroids\nbefore the start of\ninduction therapy\n.\nHow quickly and how low the   leukemia cell count drops during treatment.\nFor leukemia that\nrelapses\n(comes back) after treatment, the prognosis and treatment options depend partly on the following:\nHow long it is between the time of diagnosis and when the leukemia comes back.\nWhether the leukemia comes back in the bone marrow or in other parts of the body.\nRisk Groups for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\nKey Points\nIn childhood ALL, risk groups are used to plan treatment.\nSometimes childhood ALL does not respond to treatment or comes back after treatment.\nIn childhood ALL, risk groups are used to plan treatment.\nThere are three\nrisk groups\nin childhood\nALL\n. They are described as:\nStandard (low) risk: Includes children aged 1 to younger than 10 years who have a\nwhite blood cell\ncount less than 50,000/µL  at the time of\ndiagnosis\n.\nHigh risk: Includes children 10 years and older and/or children who have a white blood cell count of 50,000/µL  or more at the time of diagnosis.\nVery high risk: Includes children younger than age 1, children with certain changes in the\ngenes\n, children who have a slow\nresponse\nto initial treatment, and children who have\nsigns\nof\nleukemia\nafter the first 4 weeks of treatment.\nOther factors that affect the risk group include the following:\nWhether the leukemia\ncells\nbegan from\nB lymphocytes\nor\nT lymphocytes\n.\nWhether there are certain changes in the\nchromosomes\nor genes of the\nlymphocytes\n.\nHow quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops after initial treatment.\nWhether leukemia cells are found in the\ncerebrospinal fluid\nat the time of diagnosis.\nIt is important to know the risk group in order to plan treatment.  Children with high-risk or very high–risk ALL  usually receive  more  anticancer\ndrugs\nand/or higher\ndoses\nof anticancer drugs than children with standard-risk ALL.\nSometimes childhood ALL does not respond to treatment or comes back after treatment.\nRefractory\nchildhood ALL is\ncancer\nthat does not respond to initial treatment.\nRecurrent\nchildhood ALL is cancer that has\nrecurred\n(come back) after it has been treated. The leukemia may come back in the\nblood\nand\nbone marrow\n, brain,\nspinal cord\n,\ntesticles\n, or other parts of the body.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for childhood acute\n\t\t  lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\nChildren with ALL should have their\n\t\t  treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood\n\t\t  leukemia.\nThe treatment of childhood ALL usually has three phases.\nFour types of standard treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nTargeted therapy\nTreatment is given to kill leukemia cells that have spread or may spread to the brain, spinal cord, or testicles.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nImmunotherapy\nTreatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for childhood acute\n\t\t  lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\nDifferent types of treatment are available for children with\nacute\n\t\t  lymphoblastic leukemia\n(ALL). Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used\n\t\t  treatment), and some are being tested in\nclinical\n\t\t  trials\n. A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to\n\t\t  help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for\n\t\t  patients with\ncancer\n. When clinical\n\t\t  trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.\nBecause cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial\n\t\t  should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nChildren with ALL should have their\n\t\t  treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood\n\t\t  leukemia.\nTreatment will be overseen by a\npediatric\n\t\t  oncologist\n, a doctor who specializes\n\t\t  in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other\npediatric\nhealth professionals who are experts in treating children\n\t\t  with\nleukemia\nand who specialize in certain areas of\nmedicine\n. These may\n\t\t  include the following\nspecialists\n:\nPediatrician\n.\nHematologist\n.\nMedical\n\t\t\t oncologist\n.\nPediatric surgeon\n.\nRadiation\n\t\t\t oncologist\n.\nPediatric intensivist\n.\nNeurologist\n.\nNeuroradiologist\n.\nPediatric nurse specialist\n.\nSocial worker\n.\nRehabilitation specialist\n.\nPsychologist\n.\nChild-life specialist\n.\nThe treatment of childhood ALL usually has three phases.\nThe treatment of childhood ALL is done in phases:\nRemission induction\n: This is the first phase of treatment.  The goal is to kill the leukemia\ncells\nin the\nblood\nand\nbone marrow\n. This puts the leukemia into\nremission\n.\nConsolidation\n/\nintensification\n: This is the second phase of treatment. It begins once the leukemia is in remission.  The goal     of consolidation/intensification\ntherapy\nis to kill any leukemia cells that remain in the body and may cause a\nrelapse\n.\nMaintenance\n: This is the third phase of treatment. The goal is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may regrow and cause a relapse. Often the cancer treatments are given in lower\ndoses\nthan those used during the remission induction  and consolidation/intensification phases. Not taking medication as ordered by the doctor during maintenance therapy increases the chance the cancer will come back. This is also called the continuation therapy phase.\nFour types of standard treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses\ndrugs\nto stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(intrathecal), an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the\nabdomen\n, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n).\nCombination chemotherapy\nis treatment using more than one anticancer drug.\nThe way the chemotherapy is given depends on the child's\nrisk group\n. Children with high-risk ALL receive more anticancer drugs and higher doses of anticancer drugs than children with standard-risk ALL.\nIntrathecal chemotherapy\nis used to treat childhood ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain and\nspinal cord\n.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\nfor more information.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nExternal radiation therapy  may be used to treat childhood ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain, spinal cord, or\ntesticles\n. It may also be used to prepare the bone marrow for a\nstem cell transplant\n.\nChemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nChemotherapy is given to kill cancer cells. In children 3 years and older,\ntotal-body irradiation\nis given with chemotherapy. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cell transplant is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of a\ndonor\nand are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nStem cell transplant is rarely used as initial treatment for children and\nadolescents\nwith ALL. It is used more often as part of treatment for ALL that relapses (comes back after treatment).\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\nfor more information.\nEnlarge\nStem cell transplant. (Step 1): Blood is taken from a vein in the arm of the donor. The blood flows through a machine that removes the stem cells. Then the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in the other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill blood-forming cells. The patient may receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives stem cells through a catheter placed into a blood vessel in the chest.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.  Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. There are different types of targeted therapy:\nTyrosine kinase inhibitor\n(TKIs) therapy: This treatment blocks the\nenzyme\n, tyrosine kinase, that causes stem cells to develop into more\nwhite blood cells\nthan the body needs.\nImatinib mesylate\nand\ndasatinib\nare TKIs used in the treatment of children with\nPhiladelphia chromosome\n–positive ALL.\nRuxolitinib\nis a TKI that is being studied in the treatment of newly\ndiagnosed\nhigh-risk ALL.\nMonoclonal antibodies:\nMonoclonal antibodies are\nimmune system\nproteins\nmade in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these\nantibodies\ncan attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow.  The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or\nradioactive\nmaterial directly to cancer cells.\nBlinatumomab\nand\ninotuzumab\nare monoclonal antibodies being studied in the treatment of\nrefractory\nchildhood ALL. Blinatumomab is also being studied in the treatment  of standard-risk ALL.\nNivolumab\nis a monoclonal antibody being studied in the treatment of relapsed childhood ALL.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nProteasome inhibitor\ntherapy: This treatment is a type of targeted therapy that blocks the action of proteasomes in cancer cells. Proteasomes remove proteins no longer needed by the cell. When the proteasomes are blocked, the proteins build up in the cell and may cause the cancer cell to die.\nBortezomib\nis a type of proteasome inhibitor therapy used to treat relapsed childhood ALL. Bortezomib is also being studied in the treatment of standard-risk or high-risk patients.\nNew kinds of targeted therapies are also being studied in  the treatment of childhood ALL.\nSee\nDrugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\nfor more information.\nTreatment is given to kill leukemia cells that have spread or may spread to the brain, spinal cord, or testicles.\nTreatment to kill leukemia cells or\nprevent\nthe spread of leukemia cells to the brain and spinal cord (\ncentral nervous system\n; CNS) is called CNS-directed therapy. Chemotherapy may be used to treat\n\t\t\t leukemia cells that have spread, or may spread,  to the brain and spinal cord. Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not cross the\nblood-brain barrier\nto get into the\nfluid\nthat surrounds the brain and spinal cord to reach the leukemia cells in the CNS, the cells are able to hide in the CNS.  Systemic chemotherapy given in high doses or intrathecal chemotherapy (into the cerebrospinal fluid) is   able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS. Sometimes external radiation therapy to the brain is also given.\nEnlarge\nIntrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.\nThese treatments are given in addition to treatment that is used to kill leukemia cells in the rest of the body. All children with ALL receive CNS-directed therapy as part of induction therapy and consolidation/intensification therapy and sometimes during maintenance therapy.\nIf the leukemia cells spread to the testicles, treatment includes high doses of systemic chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being \n         studied in\nclinical trials\n.  \n         It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy\nis a treatment that uses the patient’s immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of\nbiologic therapy\n.\nCAR T-cell therapy\n: This treatment changes the patient's\nT cells\n(a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special\nreceptors\nare added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called\nchimeric antigen receptor\n(CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL that has relapsed (come back) a second time.\nEnlarge\nCAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient’s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient’s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.\nTreatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia may cause side effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nRegular\nfollow-up\nexams are very important.\nSide effects\nfrom cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called\nlate effects\n.\nLate effects of cancer treatment may include the following:\nPhysical problems, including problems with the heart,\nblood vessels\n,\nliver\n, or bones, and\nfertility\n. When\ndexrazoxane\nis given with chemotherapy drugs called\nanthracyclines\n, the risk of late heart effects is lessened.\nChanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory. Children younger than 4 years who have received radiation therapy to the brain have a higher risk of these effects.\nSecond cancers\n(new types of cancer) or other\nconditions\n, such as\nbrain tumors\n,\nthyroid cancer\n,\nacute myeloid leukemia\n, and\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\n.\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments. See the\nPDQ\nsummary on\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\n.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\nis done during all phases of treatment to see how well the treatment is working.\nTreatment of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Standard Risk)\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nThe treatment of newly diagnosed standard-risk childhood\nacute lymphoblastic leukemia\n(ALL) during the\nremission induction\n,\nconsolidation\n/\nintensification\n, and\nmaintenance\nphases always includes\ncombination chemotherapy\n.

A weakened immune system is unable to fight\ninfection\nand disease. People with  HIV disease have an increased risk of infection and\nlymphoma\nor other types of\ncancer\n.  A person with HIV and certain types of infection or cancer, such as lymphoma, is\ndiagnosed\nas having AIDS. Sometimes, people are diagnosed with AIDS and\nAIDS-related\nlymphoma at the same time.  For information about AIDS and its treatment, see the\nAIDSinfo website\n.\nAIDS-related lymphoma is a type of \n\t\t  cancer that affects the\nlymph system\n. The lymph system is part of the immune system. It helps protect the body from infection and disease.\nThe lymph system is made up of the following:\nLymph\n: Colorless, watery\nfluid\nthat travels through the\nlymph vessels\nand carries\nT\nand\nB lymphocytes\n.\nLymphocytes\nare a type of\nwhite blood cell\n.\nLymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.\nLymph nodes\n: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are found along a network of lymph vessels throughout the body. Groups of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm,\nmediastinum\n,\nabdomen\n,\npelvis\n, and\ngroin\n.\nSpleen\n: An\norgan\nthat makes lymphocytes, stores\nred blood cells\nand lymphocytes, filters the\nblood\n, and destroys old blood\ncells\n. The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the\nstomach\n.\nThymus\n: An organ in which T lymphocytes mature and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the\nbreastbone\n.\nTonsils\n: Two small masses of lymph\ntissue\nat the back of the\nthroat\n. There is one tonsil on each side of the throat.\nBone marrow\n: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of certain bones, such as the hip bone and breastbone. White blood cells, red blood cells, and\nplatelets\nare made in the bone marrow.\nLymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the\nbrain\n, stomach,\nthyroid gland\n, and skin.\nSometimes AIDS-related lymphoma occurs outside the lymph nodes in the bone marrow,\nliver\n,\nmeninges\n(thin\nmembranes\nthat cover the brain) and\ngastrointestinal tract\n. Less often, it may occur in the\nanus\n, heart,\nbile duct\n,\ngingiva\n, and muscles.\nEnlarge\nThe lymph system is part of the body's immune system and is made up of tissues and organs that help protect the body from infection and disease. These include the tonsils, adenoids (not shown), thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes. Lymph tissue is also found in many other parts of the body, including the small intestine.\nThere are  many different types of \n\t\t  lymphoma.\nLymphomas are divided into two general types:\nHodgkin lymphoma\n.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\n.\nBoth  non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma may occur in patients with AIDS, but non-Hodgkin lymphoma is more common. When a person with AIDS has non-Hodgkin lymphoma, it is called AIDS-related lymphoma. When AIDS-related lymphoma occurs in the\ncentral nervous system\n(CNS), it is called AIDS-related\nprimary CNS lymphoma\n.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphomas are grouped by the way their cells look under a\nmicroscope\n. They may be\nindolent\n(slow-growing) or\naggressive\n(fast-growing). AIDS-related lymphomas are  aggressive. There are  two main types of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma:\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\n(including\nB-cell\nimmunoblastic lymphoma).\nBurkitt\nor Burkitt-like lymphoma.\nFor more  information about lymphoma or AIDS-related cancers, see the following:\nAdult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment\nChildhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment\nPrimary CNS Lymphoma Treatment\nKaposi Sarcoma Treatment\nSigns of AIDS-related lymphoma  include weight loss, fever, and drenching night sweats.\nThese and other\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nmay be caused by AIDS-related lymphoma or by other\nconditions\n. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:\nWeight loss or\nfever\nfor no known reason.\nDrenching night sweats.\nPainless, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, chest, underarm, or \n\t\t\t  groin.\nA feeling of fullness below the ribs.\nTests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to\n\t\t  diagnose AIDS-related  lymphoma.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nPhysical exam\nand\nhealth history\n: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health, including\nfever\n, drenching night sweats, and weight loss, health habits, and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\n: A  procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries\noxygen\n) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nLDH\ntest\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount  of lactic dehydrogenase. An increased amount of LDH in the blood may be a sign of tissue damage, lymphoma, or other diseases.\nHepatitis B\nand\nhepatitis C\ntest\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked to measure the amounts of hepatitis B virus-specific\nantigens\nand/or\nantibodies\nand the amounts of hepatitis C virus-specific antibodies. These antigens or antibodies are called\nmarkers\n. Different markers or combinations of markers are used to determine whether a patient has a hepatitis B or C infection, has had a prior infection or\nvaccination\n, or is susceptible to infection.\nHIV test\n: A test to measure the level of HIV antibodies in a sample of blood.  Antibodies are made by the body when it is invaded by a\nforeign\nsubstance. A high level of HIV antibodies may mean the body has been infected with HIV.\nCT scan\n(CAT scan)\n:\n\t\t  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and\nlymph nodes\n, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\nPET scan\n(positron\n\t\t  emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor\ncells in the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\n: The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A\npathologist\nviews the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After  a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle is inserted into the patient’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow   are removed for examination under a microscope.\nLymph node biopsy\n: The\n\t\t\t removal of all or part of a  lymph node. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. One of the following  types of biopsies  may be done:\nExcisional\n\t\t\t\t  biopsy\n: The removal of an entire lymph node.\nIncisional biopsy\n: The removal of part of a lymph node.\nCore biopsy\n: The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle.\nOther areas of the body, such as the liver,\nlung\n, bone, bone marrow, and brain, may also have a sample of tissue removed and checked by a pathologist for signs of cancer.\nIf cancer is found, the following tests may be done to study the cancer cells:\nImmunohistochemistry\n:   A\nlaboratory test\nthat uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an\nenzyme\nor a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.\nCytogenetic analysis\n: A laboratory test in which the\nchromosomes\nof cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nFISH\n(fluorescence in situ hybridization)\n: A laboratory test used to look at and count\ngenes\nor chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of\nDNA\nthat contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient’s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.\nImmunophenotyping\n: A laboratory test that uses antibodies to identify cancer cells based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of lymphoma.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe\nprognosis\nand treatment options depend on\n\t\t  the following:\nThe\nstage\nof the cancer.\nThe age of the patient.\nThe number of\nCD4 lymphocytes\n(a type of white blood cell) in the blood.\nThe number of places in the body lymphoma is found outside the lymph system.\nWhether the patient has a history of\nintravenous\n(IV)\ndrug use\n.\nThe patient's ability to carry out\nregular daily activities\n.\nStages of AIDS-Related Lymphoma\nKey Points\nAfter AIDS-related lymphoma  has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out\n\t\t  if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nThe following stages are used for AIDS-related lymphoma:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nFor treatment, AIDS-related lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body, as follows:\nPeripheral/systemic lymphoma\nPrimary CNS lymphoma\nAfter AIDS-related lymphoma  has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out\n\t\t  if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if\ncancer\ncells\nhave spread within the\nlymph system\nor\n\t\t  to other parts of the body is called\nstaging\n. The information gathered from the\n\t\t  staging process determines the\nstage\nof the disease. It is important to know the stage  in order to plan treatment, but\nAIDS-related\nlymphoma\nis usually\nadvanced\nwhen it is\ndiagnosed\n.\nThe following tests and\n\t\t  procedures may be used to find out if the cancer has spread:\nMRI\n(magnetic\n\t\t  resonance imaging) with\ngadolinium\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the\nbrain\nand\nspinal cord\n. A substance called gadolinium is\ninjected\ninto the patient through a\nvein\n. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nLumbar puncture\n:\n\t\t\t\tA procedure used to collect\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF) from the\nspinal column\n.   This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the\nspine\nand into the CSF around the\nspinal cord\nand removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a\nmicroscope\nfor\nsigns\nthat the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. The sample may also be checked for\nEpstein-Barr virus\n. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.\nEnlarge\nLumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for AIDS-related lymphoma:\nStage I\nEnlarge\nStage I adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in one or more lymph nodes in a group of lymph nodes or, in rare cases, cancer is found in the Waldeyer’s ring, thymus, or spleen. In stage IE (not shown), cancer has spread to one area outside the lymph system.\nStage I AIDS-related lymphoma\nis divided into stages I and IE.\nIn stage I,\ncancer\nis found in one of the following places in the\nlymph system\n:\nOne or more\nlymph nodes\nin a group of lymph nodes.\nWaldeyer's ring\n.\nThymus\n.\nSpleen\n.\nIn stage IE, cancer is found in one area outside the lymph system.\nStage II\nStage II AIDS-related lymphoma\nis divided into stages II and IIE.\nIn stage II,\ncancer\nis found in two or more groups of\nlymph nodes\nthat are either above the\ndiaphragm\nor below the diaphragm.\nEnlarge\nStage II adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are either above the diaphragm or below the diaphragm.\nIn stage IIE, cancer has spread from a group of lymph nodes to a nearby area that is outside the\nlymph system\n. Cancer may have spread to other lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm.\nEnlarge\nStage IIE adult lymphoma. Cancer has spread from a group of lymph nodes to a nearby area that is outside the lymph system. Cancer may have spread to other lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm.\nIn stage II, the term\nbulky disease\nrefers to a larger\ntumor\nmass. The size of the tumor mass that is referred to as bulky disease varies based on the type of lymphoma.\nStage III\nEnlarge\nStage III adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in groups of lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm; or in a group of lymph nodes above the diaphragm and in the spleen.\nIn\nstage III AIDS-related lymphoma\n,\ncancer\nis found:\nin groups of\nlymph nodes\nboth above and below the\ndiaphragm\n; or\nin lymph nodes above the diaphragm and in the\nspleen\n.\nStage IV\nEnlarge\nStage IV adult lymphoma. Cancer (a) has spread throughout one or more organs outside the lymph system; or (b) is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are either above the diaphragm or below the diaphragm and in one organ that is outside the lymph system and not near the affected lymph nodes; or (c) is found in groups of lymph nodes above the diaphragm and below the diaphragm and in any organ that is outside the lymph system; or (d) is found in the liver, bone marrow, more than one place in the lung, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The cancer has not spread directly into the liver, bone marrow, lung, or CSF from nearby lymph nodes.\nIn\nstage IV AIDS-related lymphoma\n,\ncancer\n:\nhas spread throughout one or more\norgans\noutside the\nlymph system\n; or\nis found in two or more groups of\nlymph nodes\nthat are either above the\ndiaphragm\nor below the diaphragm and in one organ that is outside the lymph system and not near the affected lymph nodes; or\nis found in groups of lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm and in any organ that is outside the lymph system; or\nis found in the\nliver\n,\nbone marrow\n, more than one place in the\nlung\n, or\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF). The cancer has not spread directly into the liver, bone marrow, lung, or CSF from nearby lymph nodes.\nPatients who are\ninfected\nwith the Epstein-Barr virus or whose AIDS-related lymphoma affects the\nbone marrow\nhave an increased risk of the cancer spreading to the\ncentral nervous system\n(CNS).\nFor treatment, AIDS-related lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body, as follows:\nPeripheral/systemic lymphoma\nLymphoma\nthat  starts in the\nlymph system\nor elsewhere in the body, other than the brain, is called peripheral/systemic lymphoma. It may  spread  throughout the body, including to the brain or\nbone marrow\n. It is often diagnosed in an advanced stage.\nPrimary CNS lymphoma\nPrimary CNS\nlymphoma\nstarts in the\ncentral nervous system\n(brain and spinal cord). It is linked to the Epstein-Barr virus.\nLymphoma\nthat starts somewhere else in the body and spreads to the central nervous system is not primary CNS lymphoma.\nTreatment Option Overview\nKey Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with AIDS-related lymphoma.\nTreatment of AIDS-related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for AIDS.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nTargeted therapy\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nTreatment for AIDS-related lymphoma may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with AIDS-related lymphoma.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\nAIDS-related\nlymphoma\n. Some treatments are\nstandard\n(the currently used treatment), and some\n\t\t  are being tested in\nclinical trials\n.\n\t\t  A treatment clinical trial is a\nresearch study\nmeant to help\n\t\t  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients\n\t\t  with\ncancer\n. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nTreatment of AIDS-related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for AIDS.\nPatients with\nAIDS\nhave weakened\nimmune systems\nand treatment can cause the immune system to become even weaker. For this reason, treating patients who have AIDS-related lymphoma is difficult and some patients may be treated with lower\ndoses\nof\ndrugs\nthan lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS.\nHighly active antiretroviral therapy\n(HAART)    is used to lessen the damage to the immune system caused by\nHIV\n. Treatment with HAART may allow some patients with AIDS-related lymphoma to safely receive anticancer drugs in standard or higher doses. In  these patients, treatment  may work as well as it does in lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS.\nMedicine\nto prevent and treat\ninfections\n, which can be serious, is also used.\nFor more information about AIDS and its treatment, see the\nAIDSinfo website\n.\nThe following types of treatment are used:\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer\ncells\n, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a\nvein\nor muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(\nintrathecal chemotherapy\n), an\norgan\n, or a body\ncavity\nsuch as the\nabdomen\n, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (\nregional chemotherapy\n).\nCombination chemotherapy\nis treatment using more than one anticancer drug.\nIntrathecal chemotherapy may be used in patients who are more likely to have lymphoma in the\ncentral nervous system\n(CNS).\nEnlarge\nIntrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.\nChemotherapy is used in the treatment of AIDS-related peripheral/\nsystemic\nlymphoma. It is not yet known whether it is best to give HAART at the same time as chemotherapy or after chemotherapy ends.\nColony-stimulating factors\nare sometimes given together with chemotherapy. This helps lessen the\nside effects\nchemotherapy may have on the\nbone marrow\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy\nis a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant\nHigh doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including\nblood\n-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell transplant\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an\ninfusion\n. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy\nis a type of treatment that uses\ndrugs\nor other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.\nMonoclonal antibodies\n: Monoclonal antibodies are immune system proteins made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these\nantibodies\ncan attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. These may be used alone or to carry drugs,\ntoxins\n, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.\nRituximab\nis used in the treatment of AIDS-related peripheral/systemic lymphoma.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nInformation about  clinical trials is available from the\nNCI website\n.\nTreatment for AIDS-related lymphoma may cause side effects.\nFor information about\nside effects\ncaused by treatment for cancer, visit our\nSide Effects\npage.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nTreatment of AIDS-Related Peripheral/Systemic Lymphoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of\nAIDS-related\nperipheral/\nsystemic\nlymphoma\nmay include the following:\nCombination chemotherapy\nwith or without\ntargeted therapy\n.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy\nand\nstem cell transplant\n, for lymphoma that has not\nresponded\nto treatment or has come back.\nIntrathecal chemotherapy\nfor lymphoma that is likely to  spread to the\ncentral nervous system\n(CNS).\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "question": "What is the outlook for AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?",
        "answer": "The outlook for AIDS-related lymphoma is dependent on the stage of cancer, but not on the age of the patient. Additionally, having a history of intravenous drug use is generally unrelated to the prognosis and does not affect the overall outlook. Finally, while the number of CD4 lymphocytes in the blood may be considered somewhat relevant, it is ultimately the patient's ability to carry out regular daily activities that has the most significant impact on the outcome.",

        "context": "Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version\nGeneral Information About Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma\nKey Points\nChildhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer that develops in the lymph system.\nThe  two main types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma are classic and nodular lymphocyte-predominant.\nEpstein-Barr virus infection and a family history of Hodgkin lymphoma can increase\n\t\t  the risk of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.\nSigns of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen\n\t\t  lymph nodes, fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss.\nTests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to diagnose\n\t\t   and stage childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.\nYou may want to get a second opinion.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nChildhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer that develops in the lymph system.\nThe\nlymph system\nis part of the\nimmune system\n. It helps protect the body from\ninfection\nand disease.\nThe lymph system is made up of the following:\nLymph\n: Colorless, watery fluid that travels through the\nlymph vessels\nand transports\nT\nand\nB lymphocytes\n.\nLymphocytes\nare a type of\nwhite blood cell\n.\nLymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.\nLymph nodes\n: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter  lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are found along a network of lymph vessels throughout the body. Groups of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm,\nmediastinum\n(the area between the\nlungs\n),\nabdomen\n,\npelvis\n, and\ngroin\n. Hodgkin lymphoma most commonly forms in the lymph nodes above the\ndiaphragm\n.\nSpleen\n: An\norgan\nthat makes lymphocytes, stores\nred blood cells\nand lymphocytes, filters the blood, and destroys old blood\ncells\n. The spleen is  on the left side of the abdomen near the\nstomach\n.\nThymus\n: An organ in which T lymphocytes mature and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the\nbreastbone\n.\nBone marrow\n: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of certain bones, such as the hip bone and breastbone. White blood cells, red blood cells, and\nplatelets\nare made in the bone marrow.\nTonsils\n: Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the\nthroat\n. There is one tonsil on each side of the throat.\nEnlarge\nThe lymph system is part of the body's immune system and is made up of tissues and organs that help protect the body from infection and disease. These include the tonsils, thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes. Lymph (clear, watery fluid) and lymphocytes (white blood cells) travel through the lymph vessels and into the lymph nodes where the lymphocytes destroy harmful substances. The lymph enters the bloodstream through a large vein near the heart.\nBits of lymph tissue are also found in other parts of the body such as the lining of the\ngastrointestinal tract\n,\nbronchus\n, and skin.\nThere are two general types of\nlymphoma\n: Hodgkin lymphoma and\nnon-Hodgkin\n\t\t  lymphoma\n. This summary is about the treatment of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.\nHodgkin lymphoma occurs most often in adolescents 15 to 19 years of age. The\n\t\t  treatment for children and adolescents is different than treatment for adults.\nOther PDQ summaries with information related to lymphoma include the following:\nChildhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment\nHodgkin Lymphoma Treatment\nThe  two main types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma are classic and nodular lymphocyte-predominant.\nClassic Hodgkin lymphoma\nis the most common type of Hodgkin lymphoma. It occurs most often in adolescents. When a sample of lymph node tissue is looked at under a microscope, Hodgkin lymphoma\ncancer\ncells, called\nReed-Sternberg cells\n, may be seen.\nEnlarge\nReed-Sternberg cell. Reed-Sternberg cells are large, abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) that may contain more than one nucleus. These cells are found in people with Hodgkin lymphoma. Reed-Sternberg cells are also called Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells.\nClassic Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into four subtypes, based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope:\nNodular-sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma occurs most often in older children and adolescents. It is common to have a chest\nmass\nat\ndiagnosis\n.\nMixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma most often occurs in children younger than 10 years of age. It is linked to a history of\nEpstein-Barr virus\n(EBV) infection and often occurs in the lymph nodes of the neck.\nLymphocyte-rich Hodgkin lymphoma is rare in children. When a sample of lymph node tissue is looked at under a microscope, there are Reed-Sternberg cells and many normal lymphocytes and other blood cells.\nLymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin lymphoma is rare in children and occurs most often in adults or adults with\nHIV\n. When a sample of lymph node tissue is looked at under a microscope, there are many large, oddly shaped cancer cells and few normal lymphocytes and other blood cells.\nNodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma\nis less common than classic Hodgkin lymphoma. It most often occurs in children younger than 10 years of age. Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma often occurs as a swollen lymph node in the neck, underarm, or groin. Most individuals do not have any other\nsigns\nor\nsymptoms\nof cancer at diagnosis. When a sample of lymph node tissue is looked at under a microscope, the cancer cells are shaped like popcorn.\nEpstein-Barr virus infection and a family history of Hodgkin lymphoma can increase\n\t\t  the risk of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.\nAnything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a\nrisk factor\n. Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop childhood Hodgkin lymphoma, and it can develop in some children who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.\nRisk factors for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include the following:\nbeing infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)\nbeing infected with HIV\nhaving certain diseases of the immune system, such as\nautoimmune\nlymphoproliferative syndrome\nhaving a weakened immune system after an organ\ntransplant\nor from medicine given after a transplant to stop the organ from being rejected by the body\nhaving a parent, brother, or sister with a personal history of Hodgkin lymphoma\nInherited\nchanges in\ngenes\nmay increase the risk of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.\nBeing exposed to common infections in early childhood may decrease the risk of Hodgkin lymphoma in children.\nSigns of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen\n\t\t  lymph nodes, fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss.\nThe\nsigns\nand\nsymptoms\nof Hodgkin lymphoma depend on where the cancer forms in the body and the size of the cancer. It's important to check with your child's doctor if your child has any symptoms below:\npainless, swollen lymph nodes near the\ncollarbone\nor in the neck, chest, underarm, or groin\nfever for no known reason\nweight loss for no known reason\ndrenching night sweats\nfeeling very tired\nanorexia\nitchy skin\ncoughing\ntrouble breathing, especially when lying down\npain in the lymph nodes after drinking alcohol\nFever for no known reason, weight loss for no known reason, or drenching night sweats are called B symptoms. B symptoms are an important part of\nstaging\nHodgkin lymphoma and understanding the patient's chance of\nrecovery\n.\nThese symptoms may be caused by conditions other than childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. The only way to know is to see your child's doctor. The doctor will ask you when the symptoms started and how often your child has been having them as a first step in making a diagnosis.\nTests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to diagnose\n\t\t   and stage childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.\nIf your child has symptoms that suggest Hodgkin lymphoma, their doctor will need to find out if these are due to cancer or to another condition. They will ask about your child's\npersonal\nand\nfamily health history\nand do a\nphysical exam\n. The doctor may recommend diagnostic tests to find out if your child has Hodgkin lymphoma. The results of these tests will also help you and your child's doctor plan treatment.\nThe following tests and procedures may be used:\nComplete blood count (CBC)\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:\nThe number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nThe amount of\nhemoglobin\n(the\nprotein\nthat carries\noxygen\n) in the red blood cells.\nThe portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.\nEnlarge\nComplete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.\nBlood chemistry studies\n: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood, including\nalbumin\n, by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.\nC-reactive protein test\n: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of c-reactive protein in the blood. C-reactive protein is made by the\nliver\nand sent to the\nbloodstream\nin response to\ninflammation\n. A higher-than-normal amount of c-reactive protein in the blood may be a sign of disease.\nSedimentation rate\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the rate at which the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube. The sedimentation rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body.  A higher-than-normal sedimentation rate may be a sign of lymphoma.  Also called erythrocyte sedimentation rate, sed rate, or ESR.\nCT scan (CAT scan)\n:  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an\nx-ray\nmachine. A\ndye\nmay be\ninjected\ninto a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.  To learn more, see\nComputed Tomography (CT) Scans and Cancer\n.\nEnlarge\nComputed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.\nPET scan (positron emission tomography scan)\n: A procedure to find\nmalignant\ntumor cells in the body.  A small amount of\nradioactive\nglucose\n(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET\nscanner\nrotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nEnlarge\nPositron emission tomography (PET) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the PET scanner. The head rest and white strap help the child lie still.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the child's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body.  Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do.\nMRI (magnetic resonance imaging)\n: A procedure that uses a magnet,\nradio waves\n, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lymph nodes. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\nEnlarge\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.\nPET-CT scan\n: A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time with the same machine. The combined scans give more detailed pictures of areas inside the body than either scan gives by itself.\nPET-MRI scan\n: A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. A PET scan uses a radioactive tracer to highlight abnormal areas in the body. An MRI uses radio waves and a powerful magnet to take detailed pictures of tissues in the body. For a PET-MRI, the scans are done at the same time with the same machine. The combined scans give more detailed pictures of areas inside the body than either scan gives by itself. The overall amount of radiation a person is exposed to is also reduced. A PET-MRI may be used to help diagnose disease, such as cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\nChest x-ray\n: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy\n:  The removal of\nbone marrow\nand a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or\nbreastbone\n. A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for\nabnormal\ncells. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is done for patients with advanced disease and/or B symptoms.\nEnlarge\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.\nLymph node biopsy\n:\n\t\t\t The removal of all or part of one or more lymph nodes. The lymph node may be removed during an image-guided CT scan or a\nthoracoscopy\n,\nmediastinoscopy\n, or\nlaparoscopy\n. One of the following types of\n\t\t\t biopsies may be done:\nExcisional biopsy\n: The removal of an entire lymph node.\nIncisional biopsy\n: The removal of part of a lymph node.\nCore biopsy\n: The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle.\nA pathologist views the lymph node tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells called Reed-Sternberg cells. Reed-Sternberg cells are common in classic Hodgkin lymphoma.\nThe following test may be done on tissue that was removed:\nImmunophenotyping\n: A\nlaboratory test\nthat uses\nantibodies\nto identify cancer cells based on the types of\nantigens\nor\nmarkers\non the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of lymphoma.\nYou may want to get a second opinion.\nYou may want to get a second opinion to confirm your child's diagnosis and\ntreatment plan\n. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get important medical test results from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the\npathology report\n, slides, and scans before giving a recommendation. They may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another approach, or provide more information about your child's cancer.\nTo learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see\nFinding Cancer Care\n. You can contact\nNCI's Cancer Information Service\nvia chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor or hospital that can provide a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, see\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor\n.\nCertain factors affect prognosis (chance\n\t\t  of recovery) and treatment options.\nIf your child has been diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, you may have questions about how serious the cancer is and your child's chances of survival. The likely outcome or course of a disease is called\nprognosis\n. The prognosis and treatment options depend\n\t\t  on the following:\nthe\nstage\nof the cancer (the size of the cancer and whether the cancer has spread below the diaphragm or to more than one group of lymph nodes)\nthe size of the tumor\nwhether there are B symptoms (fever for no known reason, weight loss for no known reason, or drenching night sweats) at diagnosis\nthe type of Hodgkin lymphoma\nhaving more than the usual  number of white blood cells or\nanemia\nat the time of diagnosis\nwhether there is fluid around the heart or lungs at diagnosis\nthe sedimentation rate or the albumin level in the blood\nhow well the cancer\nresponds\nto initial treatment with\nchemotherapy\nthe child's sex\nwhether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has\nrecurred\n(come back)\nThe treatment options also depend\n\t\t  on:\nwhether there is a low, medium, or high risk the cancer will come back after treatment\nthe child's age\nthe risk of\nlong-term side effects\nMost children and adolescents with newly diagnosed\n\t\t  Hodgkin lymphoma can be\ncured\n.\nYour child's cancer care team is in the best position to talk with you about your child's prognosis.\nStages of Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma\nKey Points\nAfter childhood Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed,\n\t\t  tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph\n\t\t  system or to other parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nThe following stages are used for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma:\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nIn addition to the stage number, the letters A, B, E, or S may be noted.\nChildhood Hodgkin lymphoma is treated according to risk groups.\nSometimes childhood Hodgkin lymphoma does not respond to treatment  or comes back after treatment.\nAfter childhood Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed,\n\t\t  tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph\n\t\t  system or to other parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out if cancer has spread is called staging. The information gathered from the staging\n\t\t  process determines the stage of the\n\t\t  disease.  The results of the\ntests and procedures\ndone to diagnose and stage\nHodgkin lymphoma\nare used to help make decisions about treatment.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through\ntissue\n, the\nlymph system\n, and the\nblood\n:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the\nlymph vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the\nblood vessels\nto other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma:\nStage I\nEnlarge\nStage I childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer is found in one or more lymph nodes in a group of lymph nodes or, in rare cases, cancer is found in the Waldeyer’s ring, thymus, or spleen. In stage IE (not shown), cancer has spread to one area outside the lymph system.\nStage I\nis divided into stage I and stage IE.\nStage I: Cancer is found in one of the following places in the\nlymph system\n:\nOne or more\nlymph nodes\nin one lymph node group.\nWaldeyer's ring\n.\nThymus\n.\nSpleen\n.\nStage IE: Cancer is found outside the lymph system in one  organ or area.\nStage II\nStage II\nis divided\n\t\t\t into stage II and stage IIE.\nStage II: Cancer is found in two or more\nlymph node\ngroups either above or below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the\nlungs\nthat helps breathing and separates the chest from the\nabdomen\n).\nEnlarge\nStage II childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups that are either above the diaphragm or below the diaphragm.\nStage IIE: Cancer has spread from a group of lymph nodes to a nearby organ that is outside the\nlymph system\n. Cancer may have spread to other lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm.\nEnlarge\nStage IIE childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer has spread from a group of lymph nodes to a nearby organ or area that is outside the lymph system.\nStage III\nIn\nstage III\n, the cancer is found:\nin\nlymph node\ngroups above and below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the\nlungs\nthat helps breathing and separates the chest from the\nabdomen\n); or\nin lymph node groups above the diaphragm and in the\nspleen\n.\nEnlarge\nStage III childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer is found (a) in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm; or (b) in lymph node groups above the diaphragm and in the spleen.\nStage IV\nIn\nstage IV\n, the cancer:\nhas spread throughout one or more organs outside the lymph system and may be in lymph nodes near those organs; or\nis found in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are on the same side of the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the\nlungs\nthat helps breathing and separates the chest from the\nabdomen\n) and in an organ that is outside the lymph system and not near the affected lymph nodes; or\nis found in groups of lymph nodes on both side of the diaphragm and in any organ that is outside the lymph system; or\nhas spread to the lungs,\nliver\n, or\nbone marrow\nfrom areas far away.\nEnlarge\nStage IV childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.

You and your child's care team will work together to decide treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as your child's overall health, and whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has come back.\nChildren with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment\n\t\t  planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood\n\t\t  cancer.\nA\npediatric\n\t\t  oncologist\n, a doctor who specializes\n\t\t  in treating children with cancer, will oversee treatment of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. The pediatric oncologist works with\n\t\t  other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children\n\t\t  with Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These\n\t\t  may include the following specialists and others:\npediatrician\nmedical\n\t\t\t oncologist\n/\nhematologist\nradiation\n\t\t\t oncologist\npathologist\npediatric nurse specialist\npsychologist\nsocial worker\nchild-life specialist\nfertility specialist\nThe treatment of  Hodgkin lymphoma in adolescents and young adults may be different than the treatment for children. Some adolescents and young adults are treated with an adult treatment\nregimen\n.\nThe following types of treatment may be used:\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses one or more drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them  from dividing.   Cancer treatment using more than one chemotherapy drug is called\ncombination chemotherapy\n.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or\ninjected\ninto a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (\nsystemic chemotherapy\n).\nThe way the chemotherapy is given depends on the\nrisk group\n. For example, children with low-risk Hodgkin lymphoma receive fewer cycles of treatment, fewer anticancer drugs, and lower\ndoses\nof anticancer drugs than children with high-risk lymphoma.\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma\n.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy\nx-rays\nor other types of\nradiation\nto kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.\nExternal radiation therapy\nuses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nCertain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy\ntissue\n. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:\nConformal radiation therapy\nis a  type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a\n3-dimensional\n(3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor.\nIntensity-modulated radiation therapy\n(IMRT) is a type of\n3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy\nthat uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.\nRadiation therapy may be given, based on the child's risk group and chemotherapy regimen. The radiation is given only to the\nlymph nodes\nor other areas with cancer.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.  Types of targeted therapy include the following:\nMonoclonal antibody\ntherapy: Monoclonal\nantibodies\nare\nimmune system\nproteins\nmade in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer.  As a cancer treatment, these antibodies can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow.  The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading.  Monoclonal antibodies are given by\ninfusion\n.  They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or\nradioactive\nmaterial directly to cancer cells.\nRituximab\nor\nbrentuximab\nmay be used to treat high-risk,\nrefractory\n, or\nrecurrent\nchildhood Hodgkin lymphoma.\nHow do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.\nProteasome inhibitor\ntherapy blocks the action of proteasomes in cancer cells. Proteasomes remove proteins no longer needed by the cell. When the proteasomes are blocked, the proteins build up in the cell and may cause the cancer cell to die.\nBortezomib\nis a proteasome inhibitor used to treat refractory or recurrent childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.\nTo learn more, see\nTargeted Therapy to Treat Cancer\n.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy uses the patient's\nimmune system\nto fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.  Types of immunotherapy include the following:\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor\ntherapy: Some types of\nimmune cells\n, such as\nT cells\n, and some cancer cells have certain\nproteins\n, called checkpoint proteins, on their surface that keep\nimmune responses\nin check. When cancer cells have large amounts of these proteins, they will not be attacked and killed by T cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors block these proteins, and the ability of T cells to kill cancer cells is increased. The following is a type of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy:\nPD-1\nand\nPD-L1\ninhibitor therapy: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body's\nimmune responses\nin check. PD-L1 is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other.  This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells.\nPembrolizumab\nand\nnivolumab\nare types of PD-1 inhibitors that may be used in the treatment of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back after treatment. Nivolumab is being studied to  treat high-risk childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.\nEnlarge\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).\nImmunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.\nCAR T-cell therapy\nchanges the patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special\nreceptors\nare added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called\nchimeric antigen receptor\n(CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied to treat refractory or recurrent childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.\nEnlarge\nCAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient’s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient’s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.\nSurgery\nSurgery may be done to remove as much of the tumor as possible for\nlocalized\nnodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma\nin children.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell\n\t\t\t transplant\nHigh doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.\nStem cell transplant\nis a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.\nStem cells\n(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or\nbone marrow\nof the patient or a\ndonor\nand are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nFor more information, see\nDrugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma\n.\nClinical trials\nA treatment\nclinical trial\nis a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nTo learn more, see\nClinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers\n.\nProton beam radiation therapy\nProton-beam therapy\nis a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of\nprotons\n(small, positively-charged particles of matter) to make radiation. This type of radiation therapy may help lessen the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor, such as the\nbreast\n, heart, and\nlungs\n.\nTreatment for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma causes side effects and late effects.\nTo learn more about\nside effects\nthat begin during treatment for cancer, visit\nSide Effects\n.\nSide effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Because late effects affect health and\ndevelopment\n, regular\nfollow-up\nexams are important.\nLate effects of cancer treatment may include the following:\nphysical problems that affect the following:\ndevelopment of sex and\nreproductive organs\nfertility\n(ability to have children)\nbone and muscle growth and development\nthyroid\n, heart, or lung function\nteeth,\ngums\n, and\nsalivary gland\nfunction\nspleen\nfunction (increased risk of\ninfection\n)\nchanges in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory\nsecond cancers\n(new types of cancer), such as\nbreast\n,\nthyroid\n,\nskin\n,\nlung\n,\nstomach\n, or\ncolorectal\nFor female\nsurvivors\nof Hodgkin lymphoma, there is an increased risk of breast cancer. This risk depends on the amount of radiation the breast received during treatment and the chemotherapy\nregimen\nused. The risk of breast cancer is decreased if radiation to the\novaries\nwas also given.\nIt is suggested that female survivors who received radiation therapy to the breast have a\nmammogram\nand\nMRI\nonce a year starting 8 years after treatment or at age 25 years, whichever is later. It is also suggested that female survivors do a\nbreast self-exam\nevery month beginning at\npuberty\nand have a breast exam done by a health professional every year beginning at puberty until age 25 years. The breast exams done by a health professional will increase to every 6 months at age 25 years.\nFor male survivors who received radiation therapy to the chest, there may be a higher risk of\ncardiovascular disease\n.  Limiting radiation therapy to the chest is suggested if possible.\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments. To learn more, see\nLate Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer\n.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a\nclinical trial\nmay be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the\nstandard treatment\n.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the\nside effects\nof cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s\nclinical trials search\nwebpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the\nClinicalTrials.gov\nwebsite.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nAs your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to\ndiagnose\nor\nstage\nthe cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).\nFor patients who receive chemotherapy alone, a\nPET scan\nmay be done 3 weeks or more after treatment ends. For  patients who receive radiation therapy last, a PET scan should not be done  until 8 to 12 weeks after treatment ends.\nTreatment of Low-Risk Classic Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma\nFor information about the treatments listed below, see the\nTreatment Option Overview\nsection.\nTreatment of newly diagnosed low-risk\nclassic Hodgkin lymphoma\nin children may include:\nCombination chemotherapy\n.\nRadiation therapy\nmay also be given to the areas with cancer.\nUse our\nclinical trial search\nto find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

        "context": "Description\nPMM2\n-congenital disorder of glycosylation (\nPMM2\n-CDG, also known as congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ia) is an inherited condition that affects many parts of the body. The type and severity of problems associated with\nPMM2\n-CDG vary widely among affected individuals, sometimes even among members of the same family.\nIndividuals with\nPMM2\n-CDG typically develop signs and symptoms of the condition during infancy. Affected infants may have weak muscle tone (hypotonia), retracted (inverted) nipples, an abnormal distribution of fat, eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus), developmental delay, and a failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Infants with\nPMM2\n-CDG also frequently have an underdeveloped\ncerebellum\n, which is the part of the brain that coordinates movement. Distinctive facial features are sometimes present in affected individuals, including a high forehead,\na triangular face\n, large ears, and a\nthin upper lip\n. Children with\nPMM2\n-CDG may also have elevated liver function test results, seizures, fluid around the heart (\npericardial effusion\n), and\nblood clotting\ndisorders. About 20 percent of affected infants do not survive the first year of life due to multiple organ failure.\nThe most severe cases of\nPMM2\n-CDG are characterized by hydrops fetalis, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth. Most babies with hydrops fetalis are stillborn or die soon after birth.\nPeople with\nPMM2\n-CDG who survive infancy may have moderate intellectual disability, and some are unable to walk independently. Affected individuals may also experience stroke-like episodes that involve an extreme lack of energy (lethargy) and temporary paralysis. Recovery from these episodes usually occurs over a period of a few weeks to several months.\nDuring adolescence or adulthood, individuals with\nPMM2\n-CDG have reduced sensation and weakness in their arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy), an abnormal curvature of the spine (\nkyphoscoliosis\n), impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), and joint deformities (contractures). Some affected individuals have an eye disorder called\nretinitis pigmentosa\nthat causes vision loss. Females with\nPMM2\n-CDG have hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, which affects the production of hormones that direct sexual development. As a result, females with\nPMM2\n-CDG do not go through puberty. Affected males experience normal puberty but often have small testes.\nFrequency\nMore than 800 individuals with\nPMM2\n-CDG have been identified worldwide.\nCauses\nPMM2\n-CDG is caused by mutations in the\nPMM2\ngene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2). The PMM2 enzyme is involved in a process called glycosylation, which attaches groups of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) to proteins. Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can perform a wider variety of functions. Mutations in the\nPMM2\ngene lead to the production of an abnormal PMM2 enzyme with reduced activity. Without a properly functioning PMM2 enzyme, glycosylation cannot proceed normally. As a result, incorrect oligosaccharides are produced and attached to proteins. The wide variety of signs and symptoms in\nPMM2\n-CDG are likely due to the production of abnormally glycosylated proteins in many organs and tissues.\nLearn more about the gene associated with PMM2-congenital disorder of glycosylation\nPMM2\nInheritance\nThis condition is inherited in an\nautosomal recessive pattern\n, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\nOther Names for This Condition\nCarbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type Ia\nCDG Ia\nCDG1a\nCDGS1a\nCongenital disorder of glycosylation type Ia\nJaeken syndrome\nPhosphomannomutase 2 deficiency\nPMM deficiency\nPMM2-CDG\n",

        "context": "Description\nTietz syndrome is a disorder characterized by profound hearing loss from birth, fair skin, and light-colored hair. The hearing loss in affected individuals is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss) and is present from birth. Although people with Tietz syndrome are born with white hair and very pale skin, their hair color often darkens over time to blond or red. The skin of affected individuals, which sunburns very easily, may tan slightly or develop reddish freckles with limited sun exposure; however, their skin and hair color remain lighter than those of other members of their family.\nTietz syndrome also affects the eyes. The colored part of the eye (\nthe iris\n) in affected individuals is blue, and specialized cells in the eye called retinal pigment epithelial cells lack their normal pigment. The\nretinal pigment epithelium\nnourishes the retina, the part of the eye that detects light and color. The changes to the retinal pigment epithelium are generally detectable only by an eye examination; it is unclear whether the changes affect vision.\nFrequency\nTietz syndrome is a rare disorder; its exact prevalence is unknown. Only a few affected families have been described in the medical literature.\nCauses\nTietz syndrome is caused by mutations in the\nMITF\ngene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a role in the development, survival, and function of certain types of cells. Molecules of the MITF protein attach (bind) to each other or with other proteins that have a similar structure, creating a two-protein unit (dimer). The dimer attaches to specific areas of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. On the basis of this action, the MITF protein is called a transcription factor.\nThe MITF protein helps control the development and function of pigment-producing cells called\nmelanocytes\n. Within these cells, this protein controls production of the pigment melanin, which contributes to hair, eye, and skin color. Melanocytes are also found in the inner ear and play an important role in hearing. Additionally, the MITF protein regulates the development of the retinal pigment epithelium.\nMITF\ngene mutations that cause Tietz syndrome either delete or change a single protein building block (amino acid) in an area of the MITF protein known as the basic motif region. Dimers incorporating the abnormal MITF protein cannot be transported into the cell nucleus to bind with DNA. As a result, most of the dimers are unavailable to bind to DNA, which affects the development of melanocytes and the production of melanin.  The resulting reduction or absence of melanocytes in the inner ear leads to hearing loss.  Decreased melanin production (hypopigmentation) accounts for the light skin and hair color and the retinal pigment epithelium changes that are characteristic of Tietz syndrome.\nResearchers suggest that Tietz syndrome may represent a severe form of a disorder called\nWaardenburg syndrome\n, which can also be caused by MITF gene mutations.\nLearn more about the gene associated with Tietz syndrome\nMITF\nInheritance\nThis condition is inherited in an\nautosomal dominant pattern\n, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

        "context": "Description\nCYLD\ncutaneous syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by the growth of multiple noncancerous (benign) skin tumors. These tumors develop from structures associated with the skin (skin appendages), such as\nÂ hair follicles\n. More than one type of skin tumor often develops, including benign growths called cylindromas, spiradenomas, and trichoepitheliomas. Cylindromas were previously thought to derive from sweat glands, but they are now generally believed to begin in hair follicles and often appear on the scalp. Spiradenomas are related to cylindromas and it is common to find features of both of these benign growths in a single tumor.Â Trichoepitheliomas arise from hair follicles and typically develop on the skin around the nose and upper lip.\nWhile the skin tumors associated with\nCYLD\ncutaneous syndrome are typically benign, occasionally they may become cancerous (malignant). When becoming malignant, tumors often grow rapidly and become open sores (ulcers). Affected individuals are also at increased risk of developing tumors in structures other than skin; for example benign or malignant tumors of theÂ\nsalivary glands\noccur in some people with the condition. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â\nPeople with\nCYLD\ncutaneous syndrome typically begin developing tumors in late childhood or in their teens. For reasons that are unclear, females with\nCYLD\ncutaneous syndrome tend to develop more tumors than males with this condition. Tumors tend to grow larger and increase in number over time. Large benign tumors may become ulcers and prone to infections. The tumors are most often found on the head and neck, including the scalp. Tumors that occur in the eyes, ears, nose, or mouth can affect the senses, including vision and hearing. Less frequently, tumors develop on the torso, armpits, or genitals. Genital tumors may cause pain and sexual dysfunction. Rarely, cylindromas develop in\nthe airways\nand can cause problems with breathing (respiratory insufficiency).\nThe tumors in\nCYLD\ncutaneous syndrome can be disfiguring and may contribute to\ndepression\nor other psychological problems.Â\nCYLDÂ\ncutaneous syndrome includes the conditions previously called Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, multiple familial trichoepithelioma, and familial cylindromatosis. These conditions were once thought to be distinct disorders but are now considered to be the same condition.\nFrequency\nThe prevalence of\nCYLDÂ\ncutaneous syndrome is unknown, but the condition is estimated to affect more than 1 in 100,000 individuals. More than 100 affected families have been reported in the scientific literature.\nCauses\nCYLD\ncutaneous syndrome is caused by mutations in the\nCYLD\ngene\n. The\nCYLD\ngene provides instructions for making an enzyme that helps regulate numerous signaling pathways, many of which are involved in cell growth. By regulating these signaling pathways, the CYLD enzyme helps cells respond properly to signals that promote cell growth and division (proliferation) or self-destruction (\napoptosis\n),\n as necessary. The CYLD enzyme acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps prevent cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way\nPeople with\nCYLD\ncutaneous syndrome are born with a mutation in one of the two copies of the\nCYLD\ngene in each cell. This mutation prevents the cell from making functional CYLD enzyme from the altered copy of the gene. However, enough enzyme is usually produced from the remaining, normal copy of the gene to regulate cell growth effectively. For tumors to develop, a second mutation that alters or removes (deletes) the normal copy of the\nCYLDÂ\ngene must occur. The second mutation, called a somatic mutation, occurs during a person's lifetime and is found in only certain cells in the body.\nWhen both copies of the\nCYLD\ngene are mutated, the cell cannot produce any functional CYLD enzyme. The loss of this enzyme allows the cell to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way to form a tumor. In people with\nCYLD\ncutaneous syndrome, a second\nCYLD\ngene mutation typically occurs in multiple cells over an affected person's lifetime. The loss of CYLD enzyme in different types of cells, especially those in structures in the skin, leads to the growth of a variety of tumors.\nLearn more about the gene associated with CYLD cutaneous syndrome\nCYLD\nInheritance\nSusceptibility to\nCYLDÂ\ncutaneous syndrome has an\nautosomal dominant pattern of inheritance\n,\n which means one copy of the altered\nCYLD\ngene in each of the bodyâs cells increases the risk of developing this condition. The initial genetic change is known as a germline mutation, which most individuals with this condition inherit from a parent. A second, somatic mutation is required for development of tumors in\nCYLDÂ\ncutaneous syndrome. Depending when the second mutation occurs, the benign tumors may be clustered to one side of the body or face.\nRarely, the first\nCYLDÂ\ngene mutation is not inherited but is a somatic mutation that occurs early in development. As a result, some of the body's cells have a normal version of the gene, while others have the mutated version. This situation is called\nmosaicism\n.\n As in inherited cases, a second somatic mutation in the normal copy of the gene later in life is required for tumors to develop. These cases of\nCYLD\ncutaneous syndrome are not inherited and typically occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\nOther Names for This Condition\nCCS\n",

        "context": "Description\nHemophilia is a bleeding disorder that slows the\nblood clotting process\n. People with this condition experience prolonged bleeding or oozing following an injury, surgery, or having a tooth pulled. In severe cases of hemophilia, continuous bleeding occurs after minor trauma or even when there is no obvious injury (sometimes called spontaneous bleeding). Serious complications can result from bleeding into the joints, muscles, brain, or other internal organs. Milder forms of hemophilia do not necessarily involve spontaneous bleeding, and the condition may not become apparent until abnormal bleeding occurs following surgery or a serious injury.\nThe major types of this condition are hemophilia A (also known as classic hemophilia or factor VIII deficiency) and hemophilia B (also known as Christmas disease or factor IX deficiency). Although the two types have very similar signs and symptoms, they are caused by variants (also known as mutations) in different genes.  People with an unusual form of hemophilia B, known as hemophilia B Leyden, experience episodes of excessive bleeding in childhood but have few bleeding problems after puberty.\nFrequency\nThe two major forms of hemophilia occur much more commonly in males than in females. Hemophilia A is the most common type of the condition; 1 in 4,000 to 1 in 5,000 males worldwide are born with this disorder. Hemophilia B occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000 newborn males worldwide.\nCauses\nVariants in the\nF8\ngene cause hemophilia A, while variants  in the\nF9\ngene cause hemophilia B. The\nF8\ngene provides instructions for making a protein called coagulation factor VIII. A related protein, coagulation factor IX, is produced from the\nF9\ngene. Coagulation factors are proteins that work together in the\nblood clotting process\n.  After an injury, blood clots protect the body by\nsealing off damaged blood vessels\nand preventing excessive blood loss.\nVariants in the\nF8\nor\nF9\ngene lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII or coagulation factor IX, or reduce the amount of one of these proteins. The altered or missing protein\ncannot participate effectively in the blood clotting process\n. As a result, blood clots cannot form properly in response to injury. These problems with blood clotting lead to continuous bleeding that can be difficult to control. The variants that cause severe hemophilia almost completely eliminate the activity of coagulation factor VIII or coagulation factor IX. The variants involved in mild and moderate hemophilia reduce but do not eliminate the activity of one of these proteins.\nAnother form of the disorder, known as acquired hemophilia, is not caused by inherited gene variants. This rare condition is characterized by abnormal bleeding into the skin, muscles, or other soft tissues, usually beginning in adulthood. Acquired hemophilia results when the body makes specialized proteins called autoantibodies that attack and disable coagulation factor VIII. The production of autoantibodies is sometimes associated with pregnancy, immune system disorders, cancer, or allergic reactions to certain drugs. In about half of cases, the cause of acquired hemophilia is unknown.\nLearn more about the genes associated with Hemophilia\nF8\nF9\nInheritance\nHemophilia A and hemophilia B are inherited in an\nX-linked recessive pattern\n. The genes associated with these conditions are located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two\nsex chromosomes\n. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.\nIn females (who have two X chromosomes), a variant would usually have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. However, in some instances, one altered copy of theÂ\nF8\nor\nF9\nÂ gene is sufficient, because the X chromosome with the normal copy of the gene is turned off through a process calledÂ\nX-inactivation\n. X-inactivation occurs early in embryonic development in females. Through this process, one of the two X chromosomes is permanently turned off (inactivated) in somatic cells (cells other than egg and sperm cells). X-inactivation ensures that females, like males, have only one active copy of the X chromosome in each body cell.\nUsually X-inactivation occurs randomly, such that each X chromosome is active in about half of the body cells. Sometimes X-inactivation is not random, and one X chromosome is active in more than half of cells. When X-inactivation does not occur randomly, it is called skewed X-inactivation.\nIn many females with a variant in one copy of the\nF8\nor\nF9\ngene, X-inactivation is random and the chromosome with the normal copy of the gene is turned off in about half of cells. These individuals have about half the usual amount of coagulation factor VIII or coagulation factor IX, which is generally enough for normal clotting. However, in some females with an\nF8\nor\nF9\ngene variant, X-inactivation is skewed, and the chromosome with the normal copy of the gene is turned off in more than half of cells. These individuals can have less coagulation factor VIII or coagulation factor IX than usual and are at risk of abnormal bleeding.\nOther Names for This Condition\nHaemophilia\nHemophilia, familial\nHemophilia, hereditary\n",

The bones of the spine (vertebrae) are misshapen and abnormally joined together (fused). Many people with this condition have abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (\nscoliosis\n) due to malformation of the vertebrae. In addition to spinal abnormalities, some of the rib bones may be fused together or missing. Affected individuals have short, rigid necks and short torsos because of the bone malformations. As a result, people with spondylocostal dysostosis have short bodies but normal-length arms and legs, called short-trunk dwarfism.\nThe spine and rib abnormalities, which are present from birth, cause other signs and symptoms of spondylocostal dysostosis. Infants with this condition have small chests that cannot expand adequately, often leading to life-threatening breathing problems. As the lungs expand in the narrow chest, the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) is forced down and the abdomen is pushed out. The increased pressure in the abdomen can cause a soft out-pouching around the lower abdomen (inguinal\nhernia\n), particularly in males with spondylocostal dysostosis.\nSome people with spondylocostal dysostosis also have a type of birth defect known as a neural tube defect. Neural tube defects occur when a structure called the neural tube, a layer of cells that ultimately develops into the brain and spinal cord, fails to close completely during the first few weeks of embryonic development. Examples of neural tube defects that occur in people with spondylocostal dysostosis include a spinal cord abnormality known as\nspina bifida\nand a brain abnormality called a Chiari malformation.\nAlthough breathing problems can be fatal early in life, many affected individuals live into adulthood.\nSpondylocostal dysostosis has often been grouped with a similar condition called\nspondylothoracic dysostosis\n, and both are sometimes called Jarcho-Levin syndrome; however, they are now considered distinct conditions.\nFrequency\nSpondylocostal dysostosis is a rare condition, although its exact prevalence is unknown.\nCauses\nMutations in several genes are known to cause spondylocostal dysostosis. The most common form of the condition, spondylocostal dysostosis type 1, is caused by mutations in the\nDLL3\ngene. Mutations in other identified genes each account for a small number of cases of the condition.\nThe\nDLL3\ngene and other genes involved in spondylocostal dysostosis play roles in the Notch signaling pathway, which is important in embryonic development. One of the functions of Notch signaling is directing the separation of future vertebrae and ribs from one another during early development, a process called somite segmentation. When the Notch signaling pathway is disrupted, somite segmentation does not occur properly, resulting in the malformation and fusion of the bones of the spine and ribs seen in spondylocostal dysostosis.\nMutations in the identified genes account for approximately 25 percent of cases of spondylocostal dysostosis. Researchers suggest that additional genes involved in the Notch signaling pathway might also be associated with the condition.\nLearn more about the genes associated with Spondylocostal dysostosis\nDLL3\nMESP2\nAdditional Information from NCBI Gene:\nHES7\nLFNG\nRIPPLY2\nTBX6\nInheritance\nSpondylocostal dysostosis can have different inheritance patterns.

Some affected individuals have increasing weakness in the muscles that control eye movement, leading to droopy eyelids (\nprogressive external ophthalmoplegia\n).\nMost often in\nTK2\n-MDS, the muscles are the only affected tissues; however, the liver may be enlarged (hepatomegaly), seizures can occur, and hearing loss caused by nerve damage in\nthe inner ear\n(sensorineural hearing loss) may be present.

Approximately 45 cases have been described.\nCauses\nAs the condition name suggests, mutations in the\nTK2\ngene cause\nTK2\n-MDS. The\nTK2\ngene provides instructions for making an enzyme called thymidine kinase 2 that functions within cell structures called\nmitochondria\n, which are found in all tissues. Mitochondria are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities, including energy production; chemical signaling; and regulation of cell growth, cell division, and cell death. Mitochondria contain their own genetic material, known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is essential for the normal function of these structures. Thymidine kinase 2 is involved in the production and maintenance of mtDNA. Specifically, this enzyme plays a role in recycling mtDNA building blocks (nucleotides) so that errors in mtDNA sequencing can be repaired and new mtDNA molecules can be produced.\nMutations in the\nTK2\ngene reduce the production or activity of thymidine kinase 2. A decrease in enzyme activity impairs recycling of mtDNA nucleotides, causing a shortage of nucleotides available for the repair and production of mtDNA molecules.  A reduction in the amount of mtDNA (known as mtDNA depletion) impairs mitochondrial function. Greater mtDNA depletion tends to cause more severe signs and symptoms. The muscle cells of people with\nTK2\n-MDS have very low amounts of mtDNA, ranging from 5 to 30 percent of normal. Other tissues can have 60 percent of normal to normal amounts of mtDNA.\nIt is unclear why\nTK2\ngene mutations typically affect only muscle tissue, but the high energy demands of muscle cells may make them the most susceptible to cell death when mtDNA is lost and less energy is produced in cells.

Affected infants are often born with widespread blistering and areas of missing skin. Blisters continue to appear in response to minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching. Most often, blisters occur over the whole body and affect mucous membranes such as the moist lining of the mouth and digestive tract.\nPeople with EB-PA are also born with pyloric atresia, which is a blockage (obstruction) of the lower part of the stomach (\nthe pylorus\n). This obstruction prevents food from emptying out of\nthe stomach into the intestine\n. Signs of pyloric atresia include vomiting, a swollen (distended) abdomen, and an absence of stool. Pyloric atresia is life-threatening and must be repaired with surgery soon after birth.\nOther complications of EB-PA can include fusion of the skin between the fingers and toes, abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails, joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement, and hair loss (alopecia). Some affected individuals are also born with malformations of\nthe urinary tract\n, including the kidneys and bladder.\nBecause the signs and symptoms of EB-PA are so severe, many infants with this condition do not survive beyond the first year of life. In those who survive, the condition may improve with time; some affected individuals have little or no blistering later in life. However, many affected individuals who live past infancy experience severe health problems, including blistering and the formation of red, bumpy patches called granulation tissue. Granulation tissue most often forms on the skin around the mouth, nose, fingers, and toes. It can also build up in the airway, leading to difficulty breathing.\nFrequency\nEB-PA appears to be a rare condition, although its prevalence is unknown.

The proteins produced from the\nITGA6\nand\nITGB4\ngenes join to form a protein known as Î±6Î²4 integrin. This protein plays an important role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin by helping to attach the top layer of skin (\nthe epidermis\n) to underlying layers. Mutations in either the\nITGA6\ngene or the\nITGB4\ngene lead to the production of a defective or nonfunctional version of Î±6Î²4 integrin, or prevent cells from making any of this protein. A shortage of functional Î±6Î²4 integrin causes cells in the epidermis to be fragile and easily damaged. Friction or other minor trauma can cause the skin layers to separate, leading to the formation of blisters.\nAbout 15 percent of all cases of EB-PA result from mutations in the\nPLEC\ngene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called plectin. Like Î±6Î²4 integrin, plectin helps attach the epidermis to underlying layers of skin.

        "context": "Description\nFamilial exudative vitreoretinopathy is a hereditary disorder that can cause vision loss that worsens over time. This condition affects the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. In people with this disorder, blood vessels do not fully develop at the outer edges (periphery) of the retina, which reduces the blood supply to this tissue. This prolonged reduction in blood supply (chronic ischemia) causes continued damage to the retina and can lead to worsening of the condition.Â\nThe signs and symptoms of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy vary widely, even within the same family. In many affected individuals, the retinal abnormalities never cause any vision problems. Other people with this condition develop abnormal vessels that leak. This Â causes chronic inflammation which, over time, can lead to fluid under the retina (exudate). A reduction in the retina's blood supply causes the retina to fold, tear, or separate from the back of the eye (\nretinal detachment\n). The resulting retinal damage can lead to vision loss and blindness. Other eye abnormalities are also possible, including eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus) and a visible whiteness (leukocoria) in the normally black pupil.\nSome people with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy also have a condition known as\nosteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome\n, which is characterized by reduced bone density. People with this condition have weakened bones and an increased  risk of fractures.\nFrequency\nThe prevalence of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is unknown.  It is thought to be rare, although affected people with normal vision may never receive a diagnosis.\nCauses\nVariants (also called mutations) in the\nFZD4\n,\nLRP5\n, and\nNDP\ngenes cause most cases of  familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that participate in a chemical signaling pathway that affects the way cells and tissues develop. In particular, the proteins produced from the\nFZD4\n,\nLRP5\n, and\nNDP\ngenes appear to play critical roles in the specialization of retinal cells and the formation of blood vessels in the retina and the inner ear. The LRP5 protein also helps regulate bone formation.\nVariants in the\nFZD4\n,\nLRP5\n, or\nNDP\ngene disrupt chemical signaling during early development, which interferes with the formation of blood vessels at the periphery of the retina. The resulting abnormal blood supply to this tissue leads to retinal damage and vision loss in some people with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy.\nThe eye abnormalities associated with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy tend to be similar no matter which gene is altered. However, affected individuals with\nLRP5\ngene variants often have reduced bone mineral density in addition to vision loss. Variants in the other genes responsible for familial exudative vitreoretinopathy do not appear to affect bone density.\nVariants in other genes  each cause a small number of cases ofÂ familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. In other cases, the cause of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is unknown.\nLearn more about the genes associated with Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy\nCTNNB1\nFZD4\nLRP5\nNDP\nAdditional Information from NCBI Gene:\nKIF11\nTSPAN12\nZNF408\nInheritance\nFamilial exudative vitreoretinopathy has different inheritance patterns depending on the gene involved. Most commonly, the condition results from variants in the\nFZD4\nor\nLRP5\ngene and has an\nautosomal dominant pattern\nof inheritance.  Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most people with autosomal dominant familial exudative vitreoretinopathy inherit the altered gene from a parent, although the parent may not have any signs or symptoms associated with this disorder.\nFamilial exudative vitreoretinopathy caused by\nLRP5\ngene variants can also have an\nautosomal recessive pattern\nof inheritance.  Autosomal recessive inheritance  means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.\nWhen familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is caused by variants in the\nNDP\ngene, it has an\nX-linked recessive pattern\nof inheritance. The\nNDP\ngene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two\nsex chromosomes\n. In people who have only one X chromosome (typical for males), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In people who have two X chromosomes (typical for females), a variant would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that both copies of a gene would be altered, people with one X chromosome are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than those with two. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.\nOther Names for This Condition\nFEVR\n",

It is characterized by abnormal sperm and leads to an inability to father biological children (infertility).\nNormal sperm cells have an oval-shaped head with a cap-like covering called the acrosome. The acrosome contains enzymes that break down the outer membrane of an egg cell, allowing the sperm to fertilize the egg. The sperm cells of males with globozoospermia, however, have a round head and no acrosome. The abnormal sperm are unable to fertilize an egg cell, leading to infertility.\nFrequency\nGlobozoospermia is a rare condition that is estimated to affect 1 in 65,000 men.

        "context": "Description\nSepto-optic dysplasia is a disorder of early brain development. Although its signs and symptoms vary, this condition is traditionally defined by three characteristic features: underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the optic nerves, abnormal formation of structures along the midline of the brain, and pituitary hypoplasia.\nThe first major feature, optic nerve hypoplasia, is the underdevelopment of\nthe optic nerves\n, which carry visual information from the\neyes\nto the brain. In affected individuals, the optic nerves are abnormally small and make fewer connections than usual between the eyes and the brain. As a result, people with optic nerve hypoplasia have impaired vision in one or both eyes. Optic nerve hypoplasia can also be associated with unusual side-to-side eye movements (nystagmus) and other eye abnormalities.\nThe second characteristic feature of septo-optic dysplasia is the abnormal development of structures separating the right and left halves of the brain. These structures include the corpus callosum, which is a band of tissue that connects the two halves of the brain, and the septum pellucidum, which separates the fluid-filled spaces called ventricles in the brain. In the early stages of brain development, these structures may form abnormally or fail to develop at all. Depending on which structures are affected, abnormal brain development can lead to intellectual disability and other neurological problems.\nThe third major feature of this disorder is pituitary hypoplasia. The pituitary is a gland at the base of the brain that produces several hormones. These hormones help control growth, reproduction, and other critical body functions. Underdevelopment of the pituitary can lead to a shortage (deficiency) of many essential hormones. Most commonly, pituitary hypoplasia causes\ngrowth hormone\ndeficiency, which results in slow growth and unusually short stature. Severe cases cause panhypopituitarism, a condition in which the pituitary produces no hormones.  Panhypopituitarism is associated with slow growth, low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), genital abnormalities, and problems with sexual development.\nThe signs and symptoms of septo-optic dysplasia can vary significantly. Some researchers suggest that septo-optic dysplasia should actually be considered a group of related conditions rather than a single disorder. About one-third of people diagnosed with septo-optic dysplasia have all three major features; most affected individuals have two of the major features. In rare cases, septo-optic dysplasia is associated with additional signs and symptoms, including recurrent seizures (epilepsy), delayed development, and abnormal movements.\nFrequency\nSepto-optic dysplasia has a reported incidence of 1 in 10,000 newborns.\nCauses\nIn most cases of septo-optic dysplasia, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Researchers suspect that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may play a role in causing this disorder. Proposed environmental risk factors include viral infections, specific medications, and a disruption in blood flow to certain areas of the brain during critical periods of development.\nAt least three genes have been associated with septo-optic dysplasia, although mutations in these genes appear to be rare causes of this disorder. The three genes,\nHESX1\n,\nOTX2\n, and\nSOX2\n, all play important roles in embryonic development. In particular, they are essential for the formation of\nthe eyes\n, the pituitary gland, and structures at the front of the  brain (the forebrain) such as the\noptic nerves\n. Mutations in any of these genes disrupt the early development of these structures, which leads to the major features of septo-optic dysplasia.\nResearchers are looking for additional genetic changes that contribute to septo-optic dysplasia.\nLearn more about the genes associated with Septo-optic dysplasia\nHESX1\nOTX2\nPROKR2\nSOX2\nInheritance\nSepto-optic dysplasia is usually sporadic, which means that the condition typically occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\nLess commonly, septo-optic dysplasia has been found to run in families. Most familial cases appear to have an\nautosomal recessive pattern\nof inheritance, which means that both copies of an associated gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

This form of diabetes is characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin. Insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy.\nIndividuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus experience slow growth before birth (intrauterine growth retardation). Affected infants have hyperglycemia and an excessive loss of fluids (dehydration) and are unable to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive).\nIn some cases, people with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus also have certain neurological problems, including developmental delay and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). This combination of developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes is called DEND syndrome. Intermediate DEND syndrome is a similar combination but with milder developmental delay and without epilepsy.\nA small number of individuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus have an underdeveloped pancreas. Because the pancreas produces digestive enzymes as well as secreting insulin and other hormones, affected individuals experience digestive problems such as fatty stools and an inability to absorb fat-soluble vitamins.\nFrequency\nAbout 1 in 400,000 infants are diagnosed with diabetes mellitus in the first few months of life. However, in about half of these babies the condition is transient and goes away on its own by age 18 months. The remainder are considered to have permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus.\nCauses\nPermanent neonatal diabetes mellitus may be caused by mutations in several genes.\nAbout 30 percent of individuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus have mutations in the\nKCNJ11\ngene. An additional 20 percent of people with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus have mutations in the\nABCC8\ngene. These genes provide instructions for making parts (subunits) of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel. Each K-ATP channel consists of eight subunits, four produced from the\nKCNJ11\ngene and four from the\nABCC8\ngene.\nK-ATP channels are found across cell membranes in the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas. These channels open and close in response to the amount of glucose in the bloodstream. Closure of the channels in response to increased glucose triggers the release of insulin out of beta cells and into the bloodstream, which helps control blood glucose levels.\nMutations in the\nKCNJ11\nor\nABCC8\ngene that cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus result in K-ATP channels that do not close, leading to reduced insulin secretion from beta cells and impaired blood glucose control.\nMutations in the\nINS\ngene, which provides instructions for making insulin, have been identified in about 20 percent of individuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus.\nInsulin is produced in a precursor form called proinsulin\n, which consists of a single chain of protein building blocks (amino acids). The proinsulin chain is cut (cleaved) to form individual pieces called the A and B chains, which are joined together by connections called disulfide bonds to form insulin. Mutations in the\nINS\ngene are believed to disrupt the cleavage of the proinsulin chain or the binding of the A and B chains to form insulin, leading to impaired blood glucose control.\nPermanent neonatal diabetes mellitus can also be caused by mutations in other genes, some of which have not been identified.\nLearn more about the genes associated with Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus\nABCC8\nGCK\nINS\nKCNJ11\nAdditional Information from NCBI Gene:\nPDX1\nInheritance\nPermanent neonatal diabetes mellitus can have different inheritance patterns.\nWhen this condition is caused by mutations in the\nKCNJ11\nor\nINS\ngene it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

It is characterized by a clouding of the lens of the eyes at birth (congenital\ncataracts\n) and other eye abnormalities, such as small or poorly developed eyes (\nmicrophthalmia\n) and abnormal eye movements (nystagmus). Affected individuals, particularly males, often have distinctive facial features that become more apparent as they reach adulthood. These features include a prominent midface, a large nose, protruding teeth, and a small lower jaw.\nCCFDN causes progressive damage to the peripheral nerves, which connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and sensory cells. This nerve damage is known as peripheral neuropathy. Weakness in the legs, followed by the arms, begins in the first few years of life, and as a result children with CCFDN have delayed development of motor skills such as standing and walking. In adolescence, affected individuals develop sensory abnormalities such as numbness and tingling, mainly in the legs. By adulthood they typically have significant difficulties with mobility. Muscle weakness can also lead to skeletal abnormalities such as hand and foot deformities and abnormal curvature of the spine.\nPeople with CCFDN may have problems with balance and coordination (ataxia), tremors, and difficulty with movements that involve judging distance or scale (dysmetria). Some have mild intellectual disability. Individuals with CCFDN have short stature, are typically underweight, and have reduced bone density.\nA complication called rhabdomyolysis occurs in some people with CCFDN, typically following a viral infection or, in rare cases, during or after surgery. Rhabdomyolysis is a breakdown of muscle tissue that results in severe muscle weakness. The destruction of muscle tissue releases a protein called myoglobin, which is processed by the kidneys and released in the urine (myoglobinuria). The presence of myoglobin causes the urine to be red or brown. The muscles may take up to a year to recover, and the episodes may worsen the muscle weakness caused by the neuropathy.\nFrequency\nThe prevalence of CCFDN is unknown. The disorder has been identified in about 150 individuals of Romani ethnicity. Thus far, no affected individuals have been observed outside this community.\nCauses\nA mutation in the\nCTDP1\ngene causes CCFDN. The\nCTDP1\ngene provides instructions for making a protein called carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase 1. This protein helps regulate the process of transcription, which is a key step in using the information carried by genes to direct the production (synthesis) of proteins.\nAll known individuals with CCFDN have the same mutation in both copies of the\nCTDP1\ngene in each cell. This mutation alters the way the gene's instructions are pieced together to produce the carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase 1 protein. The altered instructions introduce a premature stop signal, resulting in an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein that cannot regulate transcription. Defective regulation of the transcription process affects the development and function of many parts of the body.

By their teenage years affected individuals require wheelchair assistance.\nPeople with IOSCA often develop problems with the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body functions. As a result, they may experience excessive sweating, difficulty controlling urination, and severe constipation.\nIOSCA also leads to vision and hearing problems that begin by about age 7. Children with this disorder develop weakness in the muscles that control eye movement (ophthalmoplegia).

It's also called meningococcemia. When someone has this disease, the bacteria enter the bloodstream and multiply. This damages the walls of the blood vessels and causes bleeding into the skin and organs. The symptoms may include:\nFever and chills\nFatigue\nVomiting\nCold hands and feet\nSevere aches or pain in the muscles, joints,\nchest\n, or\nabdomen\n(belly)\nRapid breathing\nDiarrhea\nA dark purple rash (in the later stages of the disease)\nBecause it is so serious, you need to seek immediate medical attention if you or your child develops the symptoms of meningococcal disease.\nHow is meningococcal disease diagnosed?\nThe signs and symptoms of meningococcal disease are often similar to those of other illnesses. This can make it hard to diagnose.\nIf your (or your child's) health care provider thinks that you or your child could have meningococcal disease, they will order tests that take samples of blood and/or\ncerebrospinal fluid\n(fluid near the spinal cord). They will send the samples to a lab for testing. The testing will include\nbacteria culture testing\n, which can identify the specific type of bacteria that is causing the infection. Knowing this can help the provider decide on the best treatment.\nWhat are the treatments for meningococcal disease?\nCertain\nantibiotics\ncan treat meningococcal disease. It is important that treatment is started as soon as possible. So if the provider thinks you have meningococcal disease, they will give you antibiotics right away (before the test results come back).\nPeople with serious disease may need additional treatments, such as:\nBreathing support\nMedicines to treat\nlow blood pressure\nSurgery to remove dead tissue\nWound care for parts of the body with damaged skin\nSome people with meningococcal disease will have long-term health problems and\ndisabilities\n. These may include:\nLoss of limb(s)\nDeafness\nNervous system problems\nBrain damage\nEven with treatment, 10 to 15 in 100 people will die from the disease.\nCan meningococcal disease be prevented?\nThe best way to prevent meningococcal disease is to get vaccinated. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends meningococcal vaccination for:\nAll preteens and teens\nChildren at higher risk for meningococcal disease\nAdults at higher risk for meningococcal disease\nIf you are a close contact of a person with meningococcal disease, you will likely be given antibiotics to prevent you from getting sick. This is called \"prophylaxis.\"  Close contacts include people who are living together. They also include people who had direct contact with the saliva of a person who has the disease (such as from kissing).\nAlthough it's rare, you can get meningococcal disease more than once.\n",

Adult women are more likely to develop it than adult men.\nWhat are the symptoms of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)?\nThe primary, or core, symptoms of ME/CFS are:\nNot being able to do activities that you used to do before the illness, along with severe fatigue. The fatigue must last six months or longer, and it is not improved by rest.\nPost-exertional malaise (PEM), which means that your symptoms get worse after any physical or mental activity.\nSleep problems\n.\nAlong with the primary symptoms, to be diagnosed with ME/CFS, you need to have one or both of these symptoms:\nProblems with thinking and\nmemory\n.\nWorsening of symptoms while standing or sitting upright. This is called orthostatic intolerance. It can cause you to feel lightheaded,\ndizzy\n, weak, or faint while standing or sitting up.\nSome of the other symptoms that ME/CFS can cause include:\nPain\n, including muscle pain, joint pain, and headaches\nSore throat\nTender lymph nodes (glands) in the neck or armpits\nDigestive issues, like\nirritable bowel syndrome\nChills and night sweats\nAllergies\nand sensitivities to foods, odors, chemicals, light, or\nnoise\nME/CFS can be unpredictable.

Your health care provider has to rule out other diseases before making a diagnosis of ME/CFS.\nYour provider will do a thorough medical exam, which will include:\nAsking about your medical history and your family's medical history.\nAsking about your current illness, including your symptoms.  Some questions they may ask could include how often you have symptoms, how bad they are, how long they have lasted, and how they affect your life.\nThorough physical and mental status exams.\nBlood, urine, or other tests to check for other illnesses which could be causing your symptoms.\nYour provider may also ask you to see a specialist to check for other conditions which can cause similar symptoms.\nWhat are the treatments for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)?\nThere is no cure or approved treatment for ME/CFS, but you may be able to treat or manage some of your symptoms.\nYou, your family, and your provider should work together to decide on a plan. You should figure out which symptom causes you the most problems and try to treat that first. For example, if sleep problems affect you the most, you might first try using\ngood sleep habits\n. If those do not help, you may need to take medicines or see a sleep specialist.\nStrategies such as learning new ways to manage activity can also be helpful. You need to make sure that you do not \"push and crash.\" This can happen when you feel better, do too much, and then get worse again.\nWhen you have ME/CFS, it can be hard to help develop a treatment plan. It can also be difficult to  try to take care of yourself.  So it's important that you have support from family members and friends.\nThere are also various resources and strategies that might be helpful to you, such as:\nGetting counseling to help you cope with the illness and its impact on your life.\nEating a healthy diet.\nNutritional supplements, if your provider suggests them.\nComplementary therapies\nsuch as meditation, gentle massage, or relaxation therapy.\nMake sure to talk to your provider before you try any new treatments.

You may be born with a heart valve problem, or it may happen because of age or an infection. You may also have a heart valve problem but not experience any\nsymptoms\n. Or, your symptoms may develop over time. Extreme tiredness (fatigue) is often the first symptom. You may also feel faint or lose consciousness, have  breathing difficulty or\nchest pain\n, or feel that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, pounding, or racing.\nTo\ndiagnose a heart valve disease\n, your doctor may ask about your symptoms, listen to your heart, or order imaging tests to look at your heart. In newborns,\nscreening tests\ncan detect and help diagnose heart valve conditions.\nMost heart valve conditions are treatable.\nMedicine\nmay treat symptoms or prevent the condition from getting worse. Your doctor may also suggest surgery or another procedure to repair or replace a faulty heart valve. If not diagnosed and treated promptly, heart valve problems can lead to\narrhythmia\n, infection,\nhigh blood pressure in the lungs\n,\nheart failure\n, or\ncardiac arrest\n.",

        "context": "Low blood pressure occurs when blood flows through your blood vessels at lower than normal pressures. The medical term for low blood pressure is hypotension.\nBlood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of your\narteries\nas the heart pumps blood. It is usually described as two numbers:\nsystolic\nand\ndiastolic\n. The numbers record blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), with systolic listed above diastolic.\nFor most adults, a normal blood pressure is usually less than 120/80 mm Hg. Low blood pressure is blood pressure that is lower than 90/60 mm Hg.\nSome people have low blood pressure all the time, and it is normal for them. Other people experience a sudden drop in blood pressure or have low blood pressure that may be linked to a health problem. This can be dangerous, as it could mean your heart, brain, or other vital organs are not getting enough blood flow and you are at risk for a\nheart attack\nor\nstroke\n.\nWhat causes low blood pressure?\nMany systems of the body, including organs, hormones, and nerves, regulate blood pressure. For example, the\nautonomic nervous system\nsends the “fight-or-flight” signal that, depending on the situation, tells the heart and other systems in the body to increase or decrease blood pressure. Problems with the autonomic nervous system, such as in Parkinson’s disease, can cause low blood pressure.\nOther causes of low blood pressure include:\nBlood loss from an injury that causes a sudden drop in blood pressure\nDehydration\nDiabetes\nHeart problems such as\narrhythmias\n(irregular heartbeat)\nMedicines to treat\nhigh blood pressure\n, depression, or Parkinson’s\nPregnancy\nOlder adults also have a higher risk for symptoms of low blood pressure, such as falling, fainting, or dizziness upon standing up or after a meal. Older adults are more likely to develop low blood pressure as a side effect of medicines taken to control\nhigh blood pressure\n.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nFor many people, low blood pressure goes unnoticed. Others may feel symptoms such as:\nConfusion\nDizziness or lightheadedness\nFainting\nFeeling tired or weak\nBlurry vision\nHeadache\nNeck or back pain\nNausea\nHeart palpitations, or feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast\nWhat should you do if you have symptoms?\nSitting down may relieve the symptoms. If your blood pressure drops too low, your body’s vital organs do not get enough oxygen and nutrients. When this happens, low blood pressure can lead to\nshock\n, which requires immediate medical attention. Signs of shock include cold and sweaty skin, rapid breathing, a blue skin tone, or a weak and rapid pulse.\nCall 9-1-1\nif you notice signs of shock in yourself or someone else.\nTalk to your doctor about your symptoms. Your doctor will use a blood pressure test to diagnose low blood pressure. Other tests may include blood, urine, or imaging tests and a tilt table test if you faint often.\nHow is it treated?\nYou may not need treatment for low blood pressure. Depending on your symptoms, treatment may include drinking more fluids to prevent dehydration, taking medicines to raise your blood pressure, or adjusting medicines that cause low blood pressure.\nYour doctor may talk to you about lifestyle changes, including changing what and how you eat and how you sit and stand up. Your doctor may also recommend compression stockings if you stand for long periods.\nLearn more about\nLow Blood Pressure\nfrom the U.S. National Library of Medicine.",
        "question": "How to diagnose Hypotension ?",
        "answer": "Hypotension is diagnosed based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor may recommend tests such as blood tests, EKG (Electrocardiogram), Holter and Event Monitors, Echocardiography, Stress Test, Valsalva Maneuver, or Tilt Table Test to determine the type and severity of hypotension you have and identify any underlying conditions causing it. However, hypotension can also be diagnosed by simply measuring your blood pressure, which is often done in a sitting position.",

It is common for providers to recommend DUS to diagnose varicose veins.\nWhat causes varicose veins?\nBlood flow in a varicose vein.\nThe veins in your legs carry blood up toward the heart. Veins have one-way valves to prevent blood from flowing back down. In varicose veins, damage in the vein walls or valves allow some blood to flow in the wrong direction.\nMedical Animation Copyright © 2023 Nucleus Medical Media. All rights reserved.\nVaricose veins are a common condition caused by weak or damaged vein walls and valves. Veins have one-way valves inside them that open and close to keep blood flowing toward the heart. Weak or damaged valves or walls in the veins can cause blood to pool and even flow backward. This is called reflux. The veins may grow larger and become distorted, resulting in varicose veins. Learn more about\nhow the heart works\nand how blood flows to and from the heart.\nVaricose veins may form whenever blood pressure increases inside your veins.

Walking and exercising makes the muscles in your lower legs contract, which can help blood return toward your heart and not pool in the veins in your legs. However, strenuous exercise, especially if it involves heavy lifting, might make varicose veins worse. Before starting any exercise program, ask your provider about the level of physical activity that is right for you.\nAvoid standing or sitting for long periods.\nWhen sitting, elevate your feet to help lower the pressure inside the veins in your legs. Lying down with your feet above the level of your heart for a few minutes several times per day can also lower the pressure in your veins and help blood return to your heart.

The goal of the treatments in the list below is to block or destroy the varicose vein that is causing blood to pool. This allows other veins to take over. Most procedures for varicose veins are minimally invasive and do not require a long recovery. Your provider may recommend that you avoid being in the sun or that you wear sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher after some procedures to help prevent scars and skin changes.\nEndovenous\nablation\nto close off a varicose vein.\nYour provider uses laser or radiofrequency energy to heat the inside of the vein and close it off. This procedure usually happens in a doctor’s office, with ultrasound to guide the treatment. Your provider numbs the area around the vein so that you do not feel pain during the procedure. Bruising, pain, and changes in skin color are common after receiving the treatment. More serious complications, including numbness,\nvenous thromboembolism\n, and skin burns, are rare.\nSclerotherapy to seal off a varicose vein.\nYour provider injects liquid or foam chemicals into the vein to create a plug that seals it shut. The procedure can take place in a doctor’s office with ultrasound guidance. Liquid sclerotherapy is more often used for spider veins. Complications of foam sclerotherapy may include skin color changes and, rarely, venous thromboembolism, nerve damage, serious allergic reaction, or\nstroke\n. Some people may have temporary vision problems, headaches, or confused mental states after this procedure.\nPhlebectomy to remove small varicose veins.\nYour provider makes small cuts to remove smaller veins near the skin. This procedure can be added on during endovenous ablation or open surgery to enhance treatment effects.\nSurgery to remove severe varicose veins.\nFor larger, deeper veins, your provider may tie off and remove varicose veins in a procedure called vein ligation or stripping. Surgery can often be done on an outpatient basis, which means that you do not need to spend the night at the hospital, but you may need medicine to sedate you so that you are not awake during the procedure. Surgery may be more painful and require more recovery time, so it is usually recommended only for people who cannot get a less invasive procedure to close off or seal the varicose vein. Surgery complications may include infection, nerve damage, bruising, pain, and changes in skin color. More serious complications are rare.\nResearch for your health\nThe NHLBI is committed to advancing science and translating discoveries into clinical practice to promote the prevention and treatment of heart and vascular diseases, including varicose veins. Learn about NHLBI efforts to improve health through\nheart and vascular disease\nresearch and scientific discovery, including studies in our\nVascular Interventions/Innovations and Therapeutic Advances (VITA) Program\n.\nCompression therapy\nYour healthcare provider may recommend compression therapy alone or, more likely, after a procedure to remove or close off varicose veins. Compression therapy involves special elastic stockings or compression bandages that put gentle pressure on the legs to help prevent swelling.\nFor some people, especially those who have to sit or stand for long periods, compression may help relieve symptoms such as pain, swelling, and heaviness in the legs. If you are pregnant, your provider may recommend compression hose. Compression therapy only relieves symptoms. Most providers now recommend procedures to correct the reflux problem that is causing your varicose veins.\nAfter you have a procedure to remove or close off your varicose veins, your provider will probably recommend wearing compression stockings for at least a week. Compression stockings may also help heal leg ulcers or sores that are a complication of varicose veins. Because vein problems are long-term issues, your provider may suggest that you continue to wear compression stockings.\nFor some people, compression stockings can cause discomfort, itching, skin irritation, or swelling.",

        "context": "What is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a condition that raises your risk for lung and other diseases.\nAAT is a protein made in your liver to help protect the lungs. If your body does not make enough AAT, your lungs are more easily damaged from smoking, pollution, or dust from the environment. This can lead to COPD or\nbronchiectasis\n, another lung disease. AAT deficiency may also cause liver disease. The liver disease can occur among infants and children, and the lung disease usually occurs in individuals who are older than 30.\nAAT deficiency runs in families. Many people do not know that they have it, but early diagnosis can help prevent COPD and other serious lung diseases. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have a family member who has AAT deficiency or who was a smoker diagnosed with COPD between ages 40 and 50. Also, talk to your provider if you have symptoms such as an ongoing cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, or liver disease.\nAnother important step to prevent or delay COPD is to quit smoking. If you do not smoke, do not start.\nHow do you get it?\nBecause AAT deficiency is an inherited disease, meaning it runs in families, it cannot be prevented. It can happen to anyone of any race or ethnicity. However, it is more common in white people of Northern European backgrounds.\nEveryone inherits two AAT genes, one gene from each parent. If you inherit a mutated or changed gene from each parent, you will have AAT deficiency.\nIf you inherit a mutated AAT gene from one parent and a normal AAT gene from the other parent, you are a carrier for the condition. You might have lower levels of AAT protein in your blood, but you most likely will not have AAT deficiency. You might also pass the mutated gene to your children.\nHow AAT deficiency is inherited.\nIn this image, both parents have a normal AAT gene and a mutated AAT gene (called being a carrier). Each child has a 25% chance of inheriting two normal genes, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting two mutated AAT genes (and having AAT deficiency).\nAAT deficiency is a complex disease, and many factors — some known, like smoking, and others still unknown — contribute to how it affects different people. Sometimes, even if you inherit two mutated AAT genes, you may not have any symptoms or health problems. You may never even realize that you have AAT deficiency.\nYou may want to talk to a genetic counselor if you are planning to have children and think they are at risk of having AAT deficiency. A genetic counselor can answer questions about the risk and explain the choices that are available.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nSome people do not have any symptoms. For those who do, symptoms usually appear in people between 20 and 50 years old.\nOften, people are diagnosed with\nasthma\nfirst. This is because wheezing is also a symptom of asthma. Also, people who have AAT deficiency respond well to asthma medicines. Some people can develop\nsymptoms of COPD\n.\nSome people who have AAT deficiency may have liver damage. Signs of liver damage include\njaundice\nand swelling in the legs. Rarely, AAT deficiency can cause skin problems, such as painful lumps or patches.\nHow is it diagnosed?\nYour healthcare provider may test you for AAT deficiency if you have relatives who have AAT deficiency or a lung or liver disease or after you develop a lung or liver disease that is related to the condition.\nA blood test\ncan check the level of AAT protein in your blood. If the level is lower than normal, it is likely that you have AAT deficiency.\nA genetic test\nis the most certain way to check for AAT deficiency and should be done to confirm the results of the blood test and find the mutation in the AAT gene. A genetic counselor can help you understand what to expect from a genetic test and what your results mean.\nA\npulmonary test\nto see how well your lungs are working may be recommended by your healthcare provider if you have COPD related to AAT deficiency.\nHow is it treated?\nThere is no cure for AAT deficiency, but there are treatments to slow the lung damage it causes. If you have emphysema and AAT, standard COPD treatments — bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, regular vaccinations, pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, and (for severe cases) surgery — may be given.\nIf you have emphysema, you may need a lifelong treatment called augmentation therapy. This treatment involves raising the AAT protein to acceptable amounts. This helps slow down lung damage. Side effects of this treatment are rare and may include a mild fever, headaches, nausea, and dizziness.\nIf you have COPD, you may also need\nmedicines or other treatments\n. Talk to your healthcare provider about ways to help prevent or delay lung damage, such as quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke, dust, or air pollution.",

        "context": "Types of blood tests\nTypes of blood tests\nBlood tests are very common. They help doctors check for certain diseases and conditions. They also help check the function of your organs and show how well treatments are working.\nComplete blood count (CBC)\nThe complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most common blood tests. It is often done as part of a routine checkup. This test measures many different parts of your blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nRed blood cell levels\nthat are higher or lower than normal could be a sign of dehydration, anemia, or bleeding. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body.\nWhite blood cell levels\nthat are higher or lower than normal could be a sign of infection, blood cancer, or an immune system disorder. White blood cells are part of your immune system, which fights infections and diseases.\nPlatelet levels\nthat are higher or lower than normal may be a sign of a clotting disorder or a bleeding disorder. Platelets are blood cell fragments that help your blood clot. They stick together to seal cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.\nHemoglobin levels\nthat are lower than normal may be a sign of anemia, sickle cell disease, or thalassemia. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.\nHematocrit levels\nthat are too high might mean you’re dehydrated. Low hematocrit levels may be a sign of anemia. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood.\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV) levels\nthat are lower than normal may be a sign of anemia or thalassemia. MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells.\nThe table below shows some normal adult ranges for different parts of the CBC test. Some of the normal ranges differ between men and women. Other factors, such as age, high altitude, and race, also may affect normal ranges.\nYour healthcare provider should discuss your results with you. They will advise you further if your results are outside the normal range for your group.\nTest\nNormal Range Results*\nRed blood cell\nAdult Men: 5 to 6 million cells/mcL\nAdult Women: 4 to 5 million cells/mcL\nWhite blood cell\n4,500 to 10,000 cells/mcL\nPlatelets\n140,000 to 450,000 cells/mcL\nHemoglobin (varies with altitude)\nAdult Men: 14 to 17 gm/dL\nAdult Women:12 to 15 gm/dL\nHematocrit (varies with altitude)\nAdult Men: 41% to 50 %\nAdult Women: 36% to 44%\nMean corpuscular volume\n0 to 95 femtoliter†\n* Cells/mcL = cells per microliter; gm/dL = grams per deciliter.\n† A femtoliter is a measure of volume.\nUsed for:\nAnemia\nBleeding Disorders\nBlood Cholesterol\nBlood Clotting Disorders\nSickle Cell Disease\nThalassemia\nBlood chemistry tests/basic metabolic panel\nThe basic metabolic panel (BMP) is a group of tests that measures different naturally occurring chemicals in the blood. These tests usually are done on the fluid (plasma) part of blood. The tests can give providers information about your organs, such as the heart, kidneys, and liver.\nThe BMP includes blood glucose, calcium, and electrolyte tests, as well as blood tests that measure kidney function. Some of these tests require you to fast (not eat any food) before the test, and others don't. Your provider will tell you how to prepare for the test(s) you're having.\nUsed for:\nHeart Failure\nHigh Blood Pressure\nBlood enzyme tests\nBlood enzyme tests may be used to check for heart attack. Enzymes are chemicals that help control chemical reactions in your body. There are many types of blood enzyme tests. The ones for heart attack include troponin and creatine kinase (CK) tests.\nBlood levels of troponin go up when a person has muscle damage, including damage to the heart muscle. In addition, an enzyme called CK-MB is released into the blood when the heart muscle is damaged. High levels of CK-MB in the blood can mean that you've had a heart attack.\nUsed for:\nHeart Attack\nLipoprotein panel\nA lipoprotein panel, also called a lipid panel or lipid profile, measures the levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides in your blood. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels that are higher or lower than normal may be signs of higher risk of coronary heart disease.\nA lipoprotein panel gives information about your:\nTotal cholesterol\nLDL (\"bad\") cholesterol,\nwhich is the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockages in the arteries\nHDL (\"good\") cholesterol,\nwhich helps decrease cholesterol blockages in the arteries\nTriglycerides\n, which are a type of fat in your blood\nMost people will need to fast for 9 to 12 hours before a lipoprotein panel.\nUsed for:\nAtherosclerosis\nBlood Cholesterol\nCoronary Heart Disease\nHigh Blood Triglycerides\nBlood clotting tests\nBlood clotting tests are sometimes called a coagulation panel. These tests check proteins in your blood that affect the blood clotting process. Levels that are higher or lower than normal might suggest that you're at risk of bleeding or developing clots in your blood vessels.\nBlood clotting tests also are used to monitor people who are taking medicines to lower the risk of blood clots. Warfarin and heparin are two examples of such medicines.\nUsed for:\nBleeding Disorders\nBlood Clotting Disorders\nPlatelet Disorders\nBone marrow tests\nBone marrow tests\nBone marrow tests check whether your bone marrow is healthy and making normal amounts of blood cells. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration and biopsy.\nAspiration\ncollects a small amount of bone marrow fluid through a larger needle.\nBiopsy\ntests are often done at the same time as the aspiration test. A biopsy test collects a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a larger needle.\nThese tests can help find the cause of low or high blood cell counts. They also play an important role in checking how well treatments for certain types of cancers, such as leukemia or lymphoma, are working.\nBefore this procedure, be sure to tell your provider about current medicines you are taking, known allergies to medicines, if you are pregnant, or if you have a bleeding disorder.\nBone marrow tests can be done in a hospital or doctor’s office or clinic. You may be awake for your test and may be given medicine to relax you during the test. You may also be under anesthesia for this test, if recommended by your care team. You will lie on your side or stomach or back, depending on where your provider obtains the samples from. Your provider will clean and numb the top ridge of the hipbone or rib bone, where the needle will be inserted. You may feel a brief, sharp pain when the needle is inserted and when the bone marrow is aspirated. The bone marrow samples will be studied in a laboratory.\nAfter your test, you will have a small bandage on the site where the needle was inserted. Most people go home the same day. You will need a ride home if you received medicines to relax you during the test. You may have mild discomfort but likely won’t have any pain after the test. Your doctor may have you take an over-the-counter pain medicine. Call your provider if you are in serious pain or if you develop symptoms including:\nFever\nRedness\nSwelling\nDischarge at the needle injection site\nUsed for:\nAnemia\nPlatelet Disorders",

        "context": "What is iron-deficiency anemia?\nWhat it is\nIron-deficiency anemia is a type of anemia that develops if you do not have enough iron in your body. It is the most common type of anemia.\nWhat are the symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia?\nSymptoms\nPeople with mild or moderate iron-deficiency anemia may not have any symptoms. More serious iron-deficiency anemia may cause common\nsymptoms\nof anemia, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Other symptoms include:\nFatigue\nDizziness or lightheadedness\nCold hands and feet\nPale skin\nWhat causes iron-deficiency anemia?\nCauses\nYour body needs iron to make healthy red blood cells. Conditions that increase your risk of iron-deficiency anemia include the following:\nBlood loss\nWhen you lose blood, you lose iron. Blood loss can happen in many ways:\nBleeding in your\ngastrointestinal tract\n(GI tract) from an inflammatory bowel disease, ulcer, colon cancer, or a or other GI disorders such as celiac disease.\nTraumatic injuries or surgery\nHeavy menstrual periods or bleeding during childbirth\nRegular use of medicines such as aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as ibuprofen and naproxen that can lead to GI tract bleeding\nUrinary tract bleeding\nProblems absorbing iron\nCertain conditions or medicines can decrease your body’s ability to absorb iron and lead to iron-deficiency anemia. These conditions include:\nCertain rare\ngenetic\nconditions\nthat block your intestines from absorbing iron or make it harder to stop bleeding\nEndurance sports,\nwhich can make athletes lose iron through their GI tracts and through the breakdown of red blood cells\nIntestinal and digestive conditions,\nsuch as celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and Helicobacter pylori infection\nSurgery on your stomach and intestines,\nincluding weight loss surgery\nOther medical conditions\nOther conditions that may cause iron-deficiency anemia include:\nKidney disease:\nPeople who have kidney disease do not make enough of a substance called erythropoietin. Your body needs erythropoietin to make red blood cells. Your doctor may prescribe erythropoietin if you have kidney disease.\nLong-lasting conditions that lead to inflammation:\nThese include congestive heart failure or obesity. They can make it hard for your body to regulate and use your body’s iron.\nSometimes young children can develop iron-deficiency anemia if they do not get enough iron in their diet. This usually occurs between the ages of 9 months and 1 year, as a child transitions to eating whole foods.\nHow do you prevent iron-deficiency anemia?\nPrevention\nIron-deficiency anemia may be preventable if you are able to treat\nthe causes of blood loss or problems with iron absorption\nthat can lead to the condition.\nIt is also always a good idea to help the body keep iron levels where they need to be by maintaining a healthy diet that includes good sources of iron and vitamin C.\nGood sources of iron\ninclude beans, dried fruits, eggs, lean red meat, salmon, iron-fortified breads and cereals, peas, tofu, and dark green leafy vegetables.\nVitamin C-rich foods\nsuch as oranges, strawberries, and tomatoes help your body absorb iron.\nEnsure that toddlers\neat enough solid foods that are rich in iron.\nHow much iron do I need each day?\nDaily iron recommendations\nThe recommended daily amounts of iron depend on your age, your sex, and whether you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\nGenerally, a diet that includes beans, dried fruits, eggs, lean red meat, salmon, iron-fortified breads and cereals, peas, tofu, and dark green leafy vegetables will provide the iron level that your body needs.\nRecommended daily iron intake for children and adults\nHow is iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed?\nDiagnosis\nTo help\ndiagnose\niron-deficiency anemia, your doctor will order a blood test to check your complete blood count (CBC), hemoglobin levels, blood iron levels, and ferritin levels. Your doctor may tell you that the iron level in your blood is low. Your doctor may also tell you that you have anemia with the iron deficiency.\nHow is iron-deficiency anemia treated?\nTreatments\nSeveral treatments can be used to treat anemia.\nIron supplements,\nalso called iron pills or oral iron, help increase the iron in your body. This is\nthe most common treatment for iron-deficiency anemia. It often takes three to six months to restore your iron levels. Your doctor may ask you to take iron supplements during pregnancy. Talk to your doctor if you have side effects such as a bad metallic taste, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or upset stomach. Your doctor may suggest taking your supplements with food, lowering the dose, or trying a different type of iron supplement.\nIntravenous or IV iron\nis sometimes used to put iron into your body through one of your veins. This helps\nincrease iron levels in your blood. It often takes only one or a few sessions to restore your iron levels. People who have serious iron-deficiency anemia or who have long-term conditions are more likely to receive IV iron. Side effects include vomiting or headaches right after the treatment, but these usually go away within a day or two.\nMedicines\nsuch as\nerythropoiesis stimulating agent (esa)\nhelp your bone marrow make more red blood cells, if this is causing your iron deficiency. These medicines are usually used with iron therapy in people who have both iron-deficiency anemia and another chronic (long-term) condition such as kidney disease.\nBlood transfusions\nquickly increase the amount of red blood cells and iron in your blood. They may be used to treat serious iron-deficiency anemia.\nSurgery\nmay be needed to stop internal bleeding.\nIn addition to the steps above, your doctor may ask you to adopt heart-healthy eating habits and to choose iron-rich foods such as beans, dried fruits, eggs, lean red meat, salmon, iron-fortified breads and cereals, peas, tofu, and dark green leafy vegetables. Foods that are rich in vitamin C can help your body absorb iron. Some foods like black tea can reduce iron absorption.\nWhat happens if iron-deficiency anemia is not treated?\nWhat happens if not treated\nUndiagnosed or untreated iron-deficiency anemia may cause serious complications such as fatigue, headaches, restless legs syndrome, heart problems, pregnancy complications, and developmental delays in children.\nIron-deficiency anemia can also make other chronic conditions worse or cause their treatments to work poorly.",
        "question": "How to diagnose Iron-Deficiency Anemia ?",
        "answer": "Iron-deficiency anemia can be diagnosed based on a combination of medical history, physical exam, and results from tests and procedures. Your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms, any past problems with anemia or low iron, diet, and medications you are taking. They may also perform a physical exam to look for signs such as pale skin, gums, and nail beds, listen to your heart for rapid or irregular heartbeats, listen to your lungs for rapid or uneven breathing, feel your abdomen for the size of your liver and spleen, and conduct a pelvic and rectal exam for internal bleeding. The first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). If the CBC results confirm anemia, other blood tests may be necessary to find out the cause of the condition, how severe it is, and the best way to treat it. These can include serum iron, serum ferritin, transferrin level or total iron-binding capacity, thyroid hormone levels, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and lead levels in children. Tests for gastrointestinal blood loss such as a fecal occult blood test may be suggested if internal bleeding is suspected to be the cause of the anemia.",
