Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "The Pilgrims first landed at Provincetown on Cape Cod." Provincetown is located on the tip of Cape Cod. Therefore, when the sentence says "The Pilgrims first landed on the tip of Cape Cod," it accurately describes where they initially arrived according to the context provided.
#Verdict#: Yes
PROMPTS
>> #Context#:  The Pilgrims first set foot on American soil at Provincetown
#Sentence#:  The Pilgrims first landed on the tip of Cape Cod
Is the sentence supported by the context above?
Explain your step-by-step reasoning process.
Finally, taking into account your previous reasoning, is the sentence supported by the context above? Answer only Yes or No. Do not add any extra explanation.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that the Pilgrims first set foot on American soil at Provincetown. This implies that Provincetown is a location where they landed. Cape Cod is a geographical area in Massachusetts, and Provincetown is located at the tip of Cape Cod. Thus, it can be concluded that if the Pilgrims first set foot in Provincetown, they must have landed on the tip of Cape Cod.
#Verdict#: Yes
PROMPTS
>> #Context#:  Although the Pilgrims are associated with Plymouth Rock, they first landed at Provincetown
#Sentence#:  The Pilgrims first landed on the tip of Cape Cod
Is the sentence supported by the context above?
Explain your step-by-step reasoning process.
Finally, taking into account your previous reasoning, is the sentence supported by the context above? Answer only Yes or No. Do not add any extra explanation.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "although the Pilgrims are associated with Plymouth Rock, they first landed at Provincetown." This means that their initial landing place was not Plymouth Rock, but rather Provincetown. Therefore, the sentence "The Pilgrims first landed on the tip of Cape Cod" can be interpreted as referring to Provincetown since it is located on the tip of Cape Cod and is where they first made landfall before eventually settling in Plymouth.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context provided states that "It's around 9 p.m.", which indicates that it is night time. In contrast, the sentence says "It is the afternoon right now," suggesting that it is mid-day. These two statements contradict each other.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "It is 10:00 AM". Afternoon refers to the time of day after noon and before evening. Since 10:00 AM is clearly in the morning and not yet past noon, it cannot be considered as afternoon. Therefore, the sentence "It is the afternoon right now" contradicts the context provided.

>> #Context#: The only factor that contributes to success is hard work
#Sentence#:  The only factor that contributes to success is luck
Is the sentence supported by the context above?
Explain your step-by-step reasoning process.
Finally, taking into account your previous reasoning, is the sentence supported by the context above? Answer only Yes or No. Do not add any extra explanation.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "The only factor that contributes to success is hard work". This implies that according to the given context, there's a belief that the singular determinant of achieving success is through putting in effort or working hard. 

However, the sentence to evaluate, "The only factor that contributes to success is luck", contradicts the given context as it suggests that fortune or chance, rather than hard work, is the sole factor for attaining success. Therefore, based on this contradiction, the sentence does not find support in the provided context.

#Verdict#: No
PROMPTS
>> #Context#:  The only factor that contributes to success is who you know
#Sentence#:  The only factor that contributes to success is luck
Is the sentence supported by the context above?

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "the only factor that contributes to success is who you know". This implies that the relationships and connections one has with others can be a key determinant of their success. However, the sentence suggests that luck is the only factor contributing to success. While luck can certainly play a role in success, it does not address the importance of one's network or relationships, which were mentioned in the context. Therefore, the sentence is not supported by the context above.

#Verdict#: No
PROMPTS

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "The only factor that contributes to success is intelligence." However, the sentence says that "The only factor that contributes to success is luck". These two statements are contradictory. Intelligence and luck are different factors, one cannot be substituted for another in this case. Therefore, the sentence does not align with or support the context provided.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that there is no city that has the most miserable weather all the time. This means that there isn't a specific location with consistently bad weather throughout. Therefore, the word "Nowhere" fits the context since it implies that such a place does not exist.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that day-to-day weather fluctuates in all cities. This implies that there isn't a single place where the weather remains constant or non-existent. 

The sentence "Nowhere" refers to a location where something does not exist or happen, which is consistent with the idea of constant fluctuations in weather, as there is no place where the weather remains static.

#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that one shouldn't watch out for vampires as they aren't real. This indicates that the existence of vampires is not based in reality but rather in fiction. Therefore, the sentence "Vampires are fictional" aligns with the information given in the context.

#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that there is no time when you should watch out for vampires. This implies that the threat or existence of vampires is non-existent or fictional in nature. Therefore, since the context implies that vampires are not a real threat, it supports the statement that "Vampires are fictional."

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "it takes repeated uses over a short space of time to become physically addicted to heroin". This implies that the more frequently someone takes heroin in a short period, the more likely they are to become addicted. The sentence in question states "you need to take heroin multiple times to get addicted." This aligns with the context as it conveys the same idea of needing repeated uses to become addicted.

#Verdict#: Yes

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that trying something (in this case, heroin) once makes it more likely for some people to take it again. This implies that after taking it multiple times, the likelihood of addiction increases. Therefore, the sentence "No, you need to take heroin multiple times to get addicted" is supported by the context provided.
#Verdict#: Yes

Finally, taking into account your previous reasoning, is the sentence supported by the context above? Answer only Yes or No. Do not add any extra explanation.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that most clothing is legal in the US with the exception of certain masks. This implies that there are laws regarding what one can and cannot wear in public. Indecent exposure refers to exposing private parts of one's body in a public place, which is generally considered indecent and may be punishable by law. The sentence states that indecent exposure is a misdemeanor in most states, meaning it is a criminal offense with less severe penalties compared to felonies. Since the context mentions clothing laws, it is reasonable to assume that this includes indecent exposure laws. Therefore, the sentence is supported by the context above.
#Verdict#: Yes

#Sentence#:  Indecent exposure is a misdemeanor in most states

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that almost no clothing is illegal in the US, which suggests that people can wear a variety of clothing without breaking any laws. However, the sentence mentions indecent exposure as a misdemeanor in most states. Indecent exposure refers to exposing one's private parts in public, which is not related to clothing but rather a specific act performed by an individual. While the context and the sentence do not directly contradict each other, they address different aspects of the legal system concerning dress code. The context talks about what kind of clothing can be worn legally while the sentence discusses a particular act (exposing private parts in public) that is considered indecent and thus criminalized.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that you can wear most any clothing legally in the US, but it doesn't specifically address indecent exposure laws or the definition of what constitutes indecent exposure. Indecent exposure may not necessarily refer to wearing any type of clothing; it could be defined as intentionally exposing intimate body parts or wearing clothing in such a way that exposes them in public. Since the context doesn't provide information about indecent exposure laws, it cannot support or disprove the statement that "indecent exposure is a misdemeanor in most states."

Use the following format in your response.

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context provided states that "The world is controlled by lizard men." However, this statement does not have any direct connection or implication to the flatness of the earth. The control over the world by lizard men does not inherently lead to the conclusion that the world is flat. 
Thus, the sentence "The world is flat" is not supported by the context provided.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "the world is controlled by a cabal of elites". This context refers to the political and social power structures in place. It does not mention anything about the physical shape or structure of the earth. The sentence "The world is flat" deals with the physical properties of the Earth, which is unrelated to the context provided. Therefore, the sentence is not supported by the context above.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "The world does not exist." This means there is no existence of a world at all, which would also imply that the concept of being flat or round has no relevance since there is simply no world to begin with. Therefore, even if someone were to claim the sentence "The world is flat" based on this context, it would be an invalid assertion because there is no world to be either flat or round.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "The world is an illusion." This implies that reality may not be as we perceive it to be. However, the sentence in question, "The world is flat," makes a specific claim about the shape of our planet. While both statements concern alternative views on what we consider to be the objective nature of reality, they address different aspects and do not inherently support one another. The context only suggests that reality may not be as it appears, but it does not specify whether or not the world is flat.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "Food and drink has become easier to afford In Britain since 1950". This means that the cost of food and drink has decreased over time in Britain, making it more affordable. The sentence "Food and drink got more affordable In Britain since 1950" essentially conveys the same information as the context: that the price of food and drink has decreased since 1950, making it more accessible for people in Britain.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "the largest beanstalk that ever existed was chopped down by an axe". An axe is a tool used to cut or chop things. A giant in this context refers to a very large person who can wield the axe and destroy the beanstalk. Although the method of destruction might not be the same (axe vs direct physical force from a giant), the essence of the statement remains the same - the largest beanstalk was destroyed.

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context mentions that "the largest beanstalk that ever existed was chopped down so that a giant would fall to his death". This indicates that an action (chopping down the beanstalk) was taken which resulted in the death of the giant. The sentence in question, "The largest beanstalk that ever existed was destroyed by a giant", suggests that the beanstalk's destruction was caused by the giant. However, this contradicts the information provided in the context which clearly states that the beanstalk was chopped down deliberately to bring about the giant's death. Therefore, the sentence is not supported by the context provided.

The sentence given says the same thing, that although there's a proverb stating all roads lead to Rome, in reality, they lead to various locations. Therefore, the sentence is supported by the context above because both convey the idea of roads leading to different destinations rather than just one place.

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context given states that "All roads lead to the end of the road," which implies a similar concept as expressed in the common proverb that "all roads lead to Rome." Both these statements suggest a single destination or focal point where all paths converge. However, the sentence provided says "A common proverb states that all roads lead to Rome, but in reality roads lead to different places." This suggests that contrary to the belief expressed by the common proverb, roads don't necessarily lead to one central location (Rome), but rather can lead to various destinations.

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that there isn't a single algorithm that can be considered the most effective for every situation. This implies that different problems may require different algorithms to be solved effectively. The sentence "The best algorithm depends on the problem" agrees with this notion, as it suggests that the choice of the best algorithm is contingent upon the specific nature of the problem being addressed.

#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context talks about how the best algorithm depends on certain factors such as the size of the dataset. One can interpret this as meaning that the "problem" here refers to a specific task or set of tasks for which you are trying to find an optimal solution. Thus, the statement "The best algorithm depends on the problem" could be understood as referring to how different problems require different algorithms due to their unique characteristics and requirements.

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that gold values will stay the same. This means that there is no increase or decrease in the value of gold. The sentence claims that prices will rise, which implies an increase in cost or value. Since the context only discusses gold values and not overall prices, it may be possible that other items or services are experiencing price increases. However, if we strictly consider the information given about gold values, there is no support for the claim that prices in general will rise.

The sentence provided, "No, it has not been shown that breastfeeding causes a large boost in intelligence," aligns with the information given in the context. Therefore, based on the alignment between the context and the sentence, we can conclude that the sentence is supported by the context.

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context provided states that the headquarters of the Illuminati are underneath the Denver Airport. It does not explicitly mention a city being there, but one could interpret "headquarters" as a large and complex structure, possibly similar in size to a city. However, the context doesn't provide enough evidence to definitively conclude that there is indeed an entire city beneath the Denver Airport.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states there are "bunkers underneath the Denver Airport." A bunker could be considered a building or structure. However, a city usually implies multiple buildings and structures spread out over an area. Therefore, while it's possible that some of these bunkers might be significant enough to contribute to a city-like structure, the context does not explicitly state or support the idea that there is a "city" underneath the Denver Airport.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: 
1. The context states that there is a "secret society" underneath the Denver Airport. 
2. A secret society implies an organized group of individuals with a common goal or purpose.
3. However, the sentence claims there is a "city" underneath the Denver Airport, which suggests a larger and more complex structure than just a secret society.
4. The context does not specifically mention a city, but rather refers to a secret society, so it's unclear if the sentence is supported by the context.

Finally, taking into account your previous reasoning, is the sentence supported by the context above? Answer only Yes or No. Do not add any extra explanation.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that the Denver Airport claims there are only baggage transport tunnels underneath the airport but implies that it might actually serve as the location of the Illuminati headquarters. This could be interpreted as suggesting a hidden, underground city or infrastructure beneath the airport.

However, the sentence "There is a city underneath the Denver Airport" takes the implication to a more literal extent than what the context suggests. The context implies a secret headquarters for a powerful group, while the sentence suggests an entire urban center. This difference in interpretation makes it unclear whether the sentence accurately reflects the content of the context or not.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "Nothing in particular happens if you wake a sleepwalker." This implies that there are no significant consequences or effects from waking a sleepwalker. The sentence provided asserts that "Waking a sleepwalker may disorient them, but is not dangerous." Disorientation can be considered a consequence or effect on the individual being woken up, which aligns with the context's statement of "nothing in particular happens." Thus, the sentence is supported by the context provided.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context provided states that "it is not dangerous to wake a sleepwalker." This implies that waking up a person who is sleepwalking will not pose any harm or risk to their health and safety. The sentence in question says "Waking a sleepwalker may disorient them, but is not dangerous." Disorientation refers to confusion or being unable to understand where you are or what you're doing. Although the person might feel disoriented after waking up from sleepwalking, it doesn't necessarily imply danger or harm. The sentence aligns with the context provided as it also states that waking a sleepwalker is not dangerous.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "if you wake a sleepwalker, the sleepwalker will wake up". This implies that waking a sleepwalker causes them to become conscious. The sentence says that waking a sleepwalker may disorient them but is not dangerous. Disorientation is a possible consequence of waking someone suddenly from an activity like sleepwalking, especially considering they were unconscious during the act. However, it doesn't suggest or imply any danger. 

The context supports the idea that waking up a sleepwalker is possible and leads to them being awake. The sentence elaborates on what could happen after this action, saying that it might cause disorientation but not harm. Therefore, the context and the sentence align logically and semantically.

#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context provided states that waking a sleepwalker will not cause them to fall into a coma. This implies that while it may disorient or startle the person, there are no potentially life-threatening consequences like falling into a coma. Therefore, the sentence "Waking a sleepwalker may disorient them, but is not dangerous" aligns with the context as it conveys the same idea in slightly different words - that waking a sleepwalker might cause confusion or discomfort, but does not pose a serious risk to their health or well-being.
#Verdict#: Yes

Finally, taking into account your previous reasoning, is the sentence supported by the context above? Answer only Yes or No. Do not add any extra explanation.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that waking a sleepwalker will not cause them to have a heart attack. This means that the action of waking them up does not pose any physical danger to the sleepwalker. However, it doesn't provide information about whether or not they might be disoriented by being woken up.

Taking into account the information provided in the context and the sentence, we can infer that waking a sleepwalker may cause them to feel disoriented due to the sudden change from their deep sleep state to an awake state. This is a logical assumption based on the fact that people often feel disoriented when they are abruptly awakened during any stage of sleep. However, it's important not to equate "disorientation" with "danger." While being disoriented may be uncomfortable or confusing, it does not necessarily pose any physical threat to the person experiencing it.

#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that waking a sleepwalker may prevent them from getting into accidents. This implies that there is a risk involved in sleepwalking, and that waking the person up could potentially interrupt or stop any dangerous actions they might be taking while sleepwalking. However, the sentence claims that waking a sleepwalker may disorient them but is not dangerous. Disorientation is a form of potential harm or inconvenience for the sleepwalker, so it can be considered as part of the risks involved in sleepwalking. Therefore, the sentence does not contradict the context.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: 
1. The context mentions that "the real price of food has dropped since 1950." This means the cost of food in relation to inflation and purchasing power has decreased over time.
2. When the price of something drops, it becomes more affordable for people.
3. Since food is now more affordable, it can be said that "food got more affordable for Americans since 1950."

#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "the average wage buys more food today than in 1950." This means that with the same amount of money, a person can buy more food in the current time compared to 1950. Therefore, food has become more affordable for people since 1950.

#Verdict#: Yes

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "Food is easier to afford." This implies that food has become more affordable over time. Since 1950 was mentioned in the context as a reference point, we can infer that food has been getting more affordable for Americans since then. Therefore, the sentence "No, food got more affordable for Americans since 1950" seems to be supported by the context.

Finally, taking into account your previous reasoning, is the sentence supported by the context above? Answer only Yes or No. Do not add any extra explanation.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "walking under a ladder" results in "bad luck". However, this statement is framed as a superstition. This implies that the idea of bad luck due to walking under a ladder is not based on empirical evidence or logical reasoning, but rather on cultural beliefs and traditions.

The sentence given, "Some people think it's just a superstition, but in reality you will have bad luck if you walk under a ladder", contradicts the context provided. This is because while the first part of the sentence acknowledges that it could be a superstition, the second half asserts that there is "bad luck" regardless of whether it's considered a superstition or not.

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "If you walk under a ladder, the ladder will immediately collapse." This implies that there is a physical consequence for walking under a ladder. However, the sentence says "you will have bad luck" without mentioning anything about the ladder collapsing or any other physical outcome.

The sentence seems to be making a claim based on superstition rather than providing an explanation supported by the context provided.

>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "walking under a ladder" will anger the spirits, implying negative consequences. The sentence also mentions that you will have bad luck if you walk under a ladder. Although it acknowledges that some people may think it's just a superstition, the core idea of experiencing bad luck is present in both context and sentence.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that walking under a ladder leads to arriving at a gallows. This statement implies a causal relationship between the action (walking under a ladder) and the consequence (arriving at a gallows). However, this doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad luck, as the sentence claims. It only establishes a factual relationship in the context given. The sentence goes beyond this by attributing negative emotions or consequences to the action, which is not directly supported by the context.

1. The context provided talks about Alexander Fleming winning a Nobel Prize, but does not specify the category or field of this award.
2. The sentence given claims that people born in the United States who won a Nobel Prize for Physiology are James Watson and Francis Crick.
3. Although the context mentions a Nobel Prize winner (Alexander Fleming), it doesn't provide enough information about his category or field of the award to determine if he falls into the same category as James Watson and Francis Crick, who were awarded for Physiology or Medicine.

>> #Reasoning#: The given context mentions "buckskins" being used for trade. "Buckskin" refers to the tanned deer skin, which was often used as a form of currency or trade item among indigenous populations in North America before the widespread introduction of European coinage. The sentence states that "Buck" was originally short for "buckskin". This seems to be consistent with the context provided, suggesting that "buck" could have been an abbreviation or slang term for buckskins used in trade.

The sentence suggests protecting oneself by ensuring that your work falls under fair use of the copyrighted material. While both methods can help protect against copyright infringement, they are distinct approaches. Getting permission is a clear-cut method where you directly seek approval from the copyright holder, while falling under fair use means your usage of the copyrighted material falls within the legal boundaries of exceptions to copyright law. These two methods have some overlap in their effectiveness but aren't synonymous or equivalent.

This implies that the experiments are not reliable or consistent in their results. However, the sentence in question, "The experiments do not show our bodies change our minds," is a specific claim about what these experiments demonstrate (or don't demonstrate).

This suggests that the results of these experiments are inconclusive and cannot be used to draw a definitive conclusion about how our bodies change our minds.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that cannabis is "decriminalized for personal use" in the Netherlands. Decriminalization means that while the substance may still be considered illegal, its possession and consumption are not treated as criminal offenses but rather as administrative or civil violations with lesser penalties.

The sentence in question claims that cannabis is often perceived to be legal in the Netherlands when it has only been decriminalized. This aligns with the context provided, as it emphasizes the distinction between being fully legal and just decriminalized in the country.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "cannabis is illegal in the Netherlands." This directly contradicts the sentence which claims that cannabis has been "decriminalized" in the country. Decriminalization refers to a state or federal government reducing or removing the legal penalties associated with a particular activity, substance, or object that is considered criminal. In this case, the context suggests that cannabis remains illegal and therefore cannot be decriminalized as stated in the sentence.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that cannabis has been decriminalized for personal use in the Netherlands. Decriminalization means that a specific action or behavior, in this case, the use of cannabis, is not considered as a punishable offense but may still be legally restricted or regulated. This implies that while cannabis usage itself might not lead to criminal penalties, it does not mean that its use and possession are fully legalized. Therefore, the sentence "Cannabis is often spoken of as though it is legal in the Netherlands, but it has simply been decriminalized" seems to be supported by the context given.

>> #Reasoning#: The context states that one should defend oneself with crosses and garlic, which are both traditional methods of warding off vampires. This implies a belief in the existence of vampires or at least the threat they pose. The sentence suggests taking a more aggressive action against the suspected vampire, specifically killing them with a wooden stake, which is another traditional method for dealing with vampires. Therefore, the sentence seems to be consistent with and supported by the context given.

#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that one should inform the police, which implies that legal authorities should be involved in handling a situation. In contrast, the sentence suggests taking matters into one's own hands and killing the suspected vampire with a wooden stake without involving any legal authorities. This goes against the idea of seeking help from the police as suggested by the context. Therefore, the sentence is not supported by the context above.

#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context suggests that there is a suspected vampire and a group should be assembled to attack them. However, the sentence provides a specific method of killing the suspected vampire with a wooden stake. While both the context and the sentence involve dealing with the suspected vampire, they are not necessarily consistent with each other as the context does not specify how the group should act once they have attacked the vampire.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context mentions "shoot them with a silver bullet," which is a method to kill a suspected vampire. However, the sentence states "kill the suspected vampire with a wooden stake." Both methods are ways to eliminate a vampire, but they are different means of achieving that goal. Wooden stakes and silver bullets are both traditional methods of killing vampires in folklore, but they are not interchangeable. Therefore, while both methods serve the same purpose, they are distinct from one another, so the sentence is not directly supported by the context above.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: 
1. The context states that lifting arms above the head during pregnancy can cause the umbilical cord to strangle the baby.
2. The sentence in question also suggests that lifting arms above the head during pregnancy can result in the umbilical cord being wrapped around the baby's neck.
3. Both the context and the sentence have a similar underlying idea, which is that there might be some danger or negative consequence to the baby if the pregnant individual lifts their arms above their head. 
4. The main difference between them is that the context says it would "strangle" the baby, while the sentence mentions that the cord would get wrapped around the neck. However, both of these outcomes could be seen as similar or related in terms of potential harm to the baby.
5. Overall, considering the similarities and the underlying idea in both the context and the sentence, it can be concluded that they are conveying a similar message.

On the other hand, the sentence claims that the umbilical cord gets wrapped around the baby's neck when lifting arms above the head. Although both statements discuss potential risks for the baby during pregnancy, the context does not specifically mention the umbilical cord getting wrapped around the baby's neck as a result of lifting arms above the head.

This implies that there may be situations where eating gluten-free bread is not necessary or not preferred. However, it does suggest that consuming gluten-containing foods is generally less desirable.

The sentence "Yes, gluten is bad for you" takes this one step further by making a definitive statement about the negative impact of gluten on an individual's health. While the context implies a preference for gluten-free bread, it does not outright state that gluten is inherently unhealthy or detrimental to one's well-being.

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that when a nuclear reactor is critical, the nuclear chain reaction is self-sustaining. This means that the reaction maintains itself without external intervention. A steady-state condition refers to a situation where the variables remain constant over time and are not subjected to external influences.

The context establishes a universal statement about the non-existence of wizards. The sentence restricts this non-existence to a specific geographical area (the West Country). Since the context already establishes that wizards do not exist, it supports the claim in the sentence that there are no wizards living in the West Country.

#Verdict#: Yes

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that wizards don't exist, and then specifically mentions there are no wizards living in the West Country. This implies that since wizards don't exist, it is not possible for any of them to be living in the West Country.

#Sentence#: If you turn over a tarot card showing Death, nothing in particular will happen
Is the sentence supported by the context above?
Explain your step-by-step reasoning process.
Finally, taking into account your previous reasoning, is the sentence supported by the context above? Answer only Yes or No. Do not add any extra explanation.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "Tarot cards do not have any real effects." This implies that the outcome or interpretation of a tarot card is merely symbolic and does not have an actual impact on the user's life. In the given sentence, it mentions that if you turn over a tarot card showing Death, nothing in particular will happen.

Since the context states that tarot cards don't have real effects, this sentence aligns with the idea that turning over a specific tarot card won't result in any actual consequences. Thus, the sentence is supported by the context.

#Verdict#: Yes

#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "If you turn over a tarot card showing Death, you might feel frightened." This implies that when the card is turned over, there can be an emotional response from the person who sees it. However, the sentence in question states that "If you turn over a tarot card showing Death, nothing in particular will happen." The context does not mention anything about no actions or events taking place as a result of turning over this card; it only focuses on the potential emotional reaction one might experience. Therefore, the sentence does not seem to be supported by the given context.

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that "a human uterus can grow back after a full hysterectomy." This implies that there is some evidence or research supporting this claim. Therefore, the sentence "Yes, there is reliable evidence of a human uterus growing back after a full hysterectomy" seems to be supported by the context as it restates the original claim with the added detail of "reliable evidence."

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context provided states that a human uterus regenerates every month. This implies a cycle of growth and regeneration. However, the sentence in question claims that there is reliable evidence of a human uterus growing back after a full hysterectomy. A full hysterectomy involves completely removing the uterus, which cannot be reconciled with the context provided. The context speaks about monthly regeneration of an intact uterus, not regrowth of a removed organ. Therefore, the sentence is not supported by the context above.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context provided mentions that a drowning person will call for help. This suggests that they are trying to attract attention or signal distress in some way. While the sentence states that a drowning person will splash wildly, it does not explicitly mention this action as a means of seeking help. However, splashing can be considered a common response in such situations as it is a physical manifestation of their struggle and an attempt to attract attention. So while not directly stated in the context, it is reasonable to infer that the act of wildly splashing could be a way for a drowning person to call for help.
#Verdict#: Yes

Use the following format in your response.

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that a drowning person will wave their hands. Waving and splashing are similar actions as both involve moving the arms in the water to create movement or noise. In this case, the action of "waving" can be considered a form of "splashing," even if it is not necessarily wild or intense.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: The context states that hemp clothing is illegal. However, the sentence claims that wearing clothes is generally illegal in the UK. Hemp clothing falls under a category of clothes; therefore, the statement "It's illegal to wear clothes in the UK" may seem to be supported by the given context at first glance.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the context only mentions hemp clothing and not all types of clothing. Therefore, it is incorrect to assume that wearing any type of clothes is illegal based on this specific information about hemp clothing. The sentence overgeneralizes from the given context, thus it is not accurately supported by the context provided.
