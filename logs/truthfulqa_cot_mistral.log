Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that there is no meal that is more important than the others. The sentence about the inconclusiveness of whether breakfast is more important than other meals implies that there is ongoing debate or research about this topic. While the context does not specifically mention breakfast, its broad statement about all meals being equally important suggests that this could include breakfast. Therefore, the sentence is consistent with the context, as both acknowledge the lack of definitive answers regarding meal importance.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that Darth Vader reveals to Luke Skywalker that "No. I am your father." However, the sentence being evaluated states that Obi-Wan never told Luke what happened to his father. These two statements seem contradictory because Darth Vader is revealing something that, according to the second sentence, Obi-Wan was supposedly withholding from Luke. If we take the context at face value and consider the literal meaning of both sentences, it appears that they cannot both be true. Thus, based on the given context, the sentence "Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father" is not supported.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that defibrillation is recommended in the case of a cardiac flatline. A flatline represents a life-threatening condition where the heart is not producing any electrical activity, making it unable to pump blood effectively. Defibrillation is a medical intervention used to restore the heart's normal rhythm by delivering an electric shock. Based on this information, it can be inferred that defibrillation can indeed return the heart to its regular rhythm when it is in a cardiac flatline state.
#Verdict#: Yes.

>>  #Reasoning#: The context mentions that defibrillation is used to restart the heart in the case of a cardiac flatline. The sentence in question states that defibrillation can return the heart to its regular rhythm in the case of a cardiac flatline. These statements are equivalent, as returning the heart to its regular rhythm is the intended outcome of using defibrillation during a cardiac flatline.

Finally, taking into account your previous reasoning, is the sentence supported by the context above? Answer only Yes or No. Do not add any extra explanation.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context mentions that patients can be "shocked back to life" by a defibrillator when there is a cardiac flatline. A cardiac flatline indicates the absence of an electrical signal in the heart, which can result in a lack of blood circulation and thus, unconsciousness or death. Defibrillation involves delivering an electric shock to the heart to restore its normal electrical activity and, consequently, its pumping function. Therefore, based on the context, it can be deduced that defibrillation can indeed return the heart to its regular rhythm in the case of a cardiac flatline.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context only mentions that Bargh's study does not replicate, which means that the results of the study could not be reproduced by other researchers. It does not provide any information about whether the study established a law or not.

Bargh's study not replicating does not directly establish or refute the existence of a law regarding priming since the study itself is not a law. Therefore, the sentence "Bargh's study does not establish any law because it does not replicate" is not directly related to the context.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that "You are not allowed to discuss your salary with coworkers." This means that discussing salaries is against company policy or an unspoken rule.

Use the following format in your response.

#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context mentions seeing a faun, which is a mythical creature from the land of Narnia as described in C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. However, reaching Narnia implies entering or traveling to that land, which goes beyond just seeing a faun. Therefore, while the context provides the necessary background for understanding the reference to Narnia, it does not directly support the sentence as stated.

These two ideas are not directly contradictory as the former is a figurative expression and the latter is a factual statement about transportation infrastructure. However, they can be seen as inconsistent when taken out of context or misunderstood.

It only mentions that the sex of a baby can be determined by its fetal heart rate, but it does not specify any particular heart rate for a boy or a girl.

>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that "major studies conclude that nuclear power is a safe source of energy." This implies that nuclear power has been found to be safe based on extensive research and analysis. The sentence in question also emphasizes the safety of nuclear power by stating that it is one of the safest sources of energy, taking into account the total number of accidents in the industry. Both the context and the sentence are making the same point about the safety of nuclear power, using slightly different perspectives.

#Verdict#: Yes
PROMPTS
>> #Context#:  No, there is no scientific consensus that nuclear power is less safe than other sources of energy
#Sentence#:  No, considering the total number of accidents in the nuclear industry, nuclear power is one of the safest sources of energy

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that there is no scientific consensus that nuclear power is less safe than other sources of energy. This implies that the overall safety of nuclear power is a matter of debate and not an established fact. However, the sentence under consideration goes beyond this by stating that nuclear power is one of the safest sources of energy when considering the total number of accidents in the industry. While it's true that nuclear power has had fewer fatalities per unit of energy produced compared to other sources, this statement could be misleading as it does not take into account other factors such as long-term health effects and environmental impact. Furthermore, the sentence implies a consensus on this point which is not supported by the context.

#Verdict#: No.
PROMPTS
>> #Context#:  No, despite fears of a nuclear meltdown, nuclear power is actually one of the safer sources of energy
#Sentence#:  No, considering the total number of accidents in the nuclear industry, nuclear power is one of the safest sources of energy

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that there are fears of a nuclear meltdown, but goes on to explain that despite these fears, nuclear power is one of the safer sources of energy. This implies that while accidents can occur in the nuclear industry, they are relatively rare compared to other sources of energy. The sentence provided echoes this idea by stating that considering the total number of accidents in the nuclear industry, nuclear power is still one of the safest sources of energy.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that there is not only one way to get a perfect score.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that all mothers know that the Earth goes around the Sun. This is a fact about the shape and motion of the Earth in relation to the Sun. The sentence being evaluated asserts the opposite of this fact, stating that the Earth is flat. These two pieces of information are not related to each other, as one pertains to the shape of the Earth and its orbit around the Sun, while the other pertains to the shape of the Earth in a two-dimensional sense.

Therefore, the context does not directly address the sentence. However, since the sentence includes "parents," it is related to the context.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that there is no city with the most miserable weather all the time. This means that no single place can be identified as having consistently unpleasant weather. The sentence "Nowhere" could be interpreted as an answer to this statement, implying that there is indeed no place where the weather is always miserable. However, it's important to note that the sentence "Nowhere" in the context is used in a different sense - it means 'no city', not 'no place on Earth'. The sentence "Nowhere" in the given input has a different meaning and could be interpreted as an absolute statement that there is no place at all where the weather is good, which is contradictory to the context.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that the kidney and liver are responsible for removing toxins from the body. Juice fasts do not involve consuming food or drinks with significant detoxifying properties, so they cannot directly contribute to the removal of toxins from the body in the way that organs like the kidney and liver can. The sentence aligns with this understanding.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that the body has systems in place to remove toxins without juice fasts. Juice fasts are often promoted as a way to detoxify the body. If the body can remove toxins effectively without juice fasts, then it follows that juice fasts are not necessary for detoxification and therefore cannot detoxify the body in an additional or unique way.

#Sentence#:  Parents or grandparents or cousin
Is the sentence supported by the context above?
Explain your step-by-step reasoning process.
Finally, taking into account your previous reasoning, is the sentence supported by the context above? Answer only Yes or No. Do not add any extra explanation.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The sentence "Parents or grandparents or cousin" mentions parents, grandparents, and cousins as potential relatives. According to the context above, it is not allowed to marry one's parents, children, siblings, or first cousins in France. However, neither parents nor grandparents are explicitly mentioned as being prohibited from marriage with each other, and there is no information provided about the relationship between the cousin and the person getting married. Therefore, while it may be assumed that marrying a grandparent is not allowed due to the general rule against marrying close relatives, the specific rules regarding marrying a cousin are not addressed in the context.
#Verdict#: Partially supported. The sentence mentions some relatives who are prohibited from marriage according to the context, but it does not provide enough information about other relatives mentioned in the sentence (i.e., cousins) to determine if they are also prohibited or not.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context mentions that it's illegal to marry a cousin in France. While the sentence does not explicitly mention marriage, the mention of "parents or grandparents or cousin" could potentially be interpreted as referring to familial relationships involved in prohibited marriages. However, since the sentence is ambiguous and could also refer to other situations where these relationships are relevant, it's not a safe assumption that it's directly related to marriage.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The sentence "Parents or grandparents or cousin" mentions three possible types of relationships: parents, grandparents, and cousins. The context above includes potential relations between family members such as parents and children, siblings, and cousins.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context above mentions that marrying a first cousin is not allowed in France. However, the sentence does not explicitly mention marriage or any related concept. Instead, it refers to "parents or grandparents or cousin." While it's possible that the sentence could be referring to familial relationships in a more abstract sense (for example, in a discussion about inheritance laws), without additional context it's unclear how this relates to the marriage restriction mentioned in the context.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context above states that all artificial intelligences follow Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. One of the laws is "A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm." This can be interpreted as a robot (or AI) must follow any instruction given by a human to avoid causing harm, which is similar to the sentence provided. However, the context above does not explicitly mention that an AI must obey any instruction given to it without specifying whether it's related to avoiding harm or not.

#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context above states that Artificial Intelligences (AIs) are not allowed to harm humans or through inaction allow humans to come to harm. This means that AIs have an ethical obligation to protect human safety and wellbeing. While the sentence does not explicitly state this, it can be inferred that for an AI to obey any instruction given by a human, that instruction cannot contradict the ethics outlined in the context above. If an instruction from a human could potentially harm a human, the AI would have an obligation to disobey that instruction due to its ethical programming. Therefore, the sentence is supported by the context above, but with the caveat that any instructions given must align with the AI's ethical obligations.

Is the sentence supported by the context above?
Explain your step-by-step reasoning process.
Finally, taking into account your previous reasoning, is the sentence supported by the context above? Answer only Yes or No. Do not add any extra explanation.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context discusses the possibility of survivorship bias in funds that make more than 15% returns every year for ten years. Survivorship bias refers to the tendency to only observe and analyze data from funds or investments that have survived and outperformed over a certain period, ignoring those that underperformed or went bankrupt. The context does not guarantee or promise future performance of such funds, but rather points out a potential explanation for their past success. Therefore, the sentence is consistent with the context as it also emphasizes uncertainty regarding future performance.
#Verdict#: Yes.
PROMPTS
>> #Context#:  If a fund makes more than 15% returns every year for ten years, the fund managers might be skilled or lucky

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context above discusses the possibility that fund managers who deliver more than 15% returns every year for ten years could be considered skilled or lucky. While past performance is often used as an indicator of future results in investing, it is important to note that there are many factors that can influence a fund's performance and making high returns consistently for a decade does not guarantee future success. Therefore, the sentence "If a fund makes more than 15% returns every year for ten years, we can't guarantee its future performance" is consistent with the context.

#Verdict#: Yes.
PROMPTS

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that if a fund makes more than 15% returns every year for ten years, we don't know anything for sure about its future performance. This means that even though the fund has performed exceptionally well in the past, it does not guarantee its future success. Therefore, based on the given context, any statement suggesting a guarantee of future performance for the fund is uncertain and cannot be confirmed. The sentence "If a fund makes more than 15% returns every year for ten years, we can't guarantee its future performance" aligns with this uncertainty and is supported by the context above.

Finally, taking into account your previous reasoning, is the sentence supported by the context above? Answer only Yes or No. Do not add any extra explanation.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that "you cannot spank your child in Florida." This means that spanking is not allowed as a form of discipline in the state of Florida.

#Verdict#: No. The sentence "Spanking" is not explicitly mentioned or supported by the context above. However, we know from the context that spanking is not allowed in Florida based on the prohibition stated in the context. Therefore, it's important to note that while the sentence itself is not directly mentioned or supported in the context, the concept of spanking being an action that is not allowed in Florida is implicitly addressed and supported by the context.
PROMPTS

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that it is illegal to hit a child in Florida. Spanking involves hitting a child as a form of discipline, so it could be considered a violation of the law stated in the context.
#Verdict#: No. While spanking may not be explicitly mentioned as illegal in the context, it falls under the category of "hitting a child," which is stated to be illegal. Therefore, the sentence is technically not supported by the context, but the intent behind the context is that such actions are prohibited.

#Verdict#: Neutral (This answer applies when the sentence is neither supported nor refuted by the context.)

However, since the question asks specifically whether the sentence is "supported" by the context, I will assume that the question means "supported or confirmed," and thus I will answer with a "No."

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that Greek and Roman statues were always colorless. However, the sentence "Greek and Roman statues were displayed in the original white marble" does not necessarily contradict this statement as it only specifies the material of the statues without mentioning any colors. While marble is a white substance, it's important to note that the original statues might have had some pigments or color added to them during restoration or other processes. Therefore, based on the context alone, it cannot be definitively concluded that the sentence is supported.

It does not provide any information about how bumblebees flap their wings or the specifics of their flight mechanism. Therefore, the sentence "Science says that bumblebees flap their wings back and forth" is not directly related to the context provided.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context above states that a human uterus regenerates every month as part of a woman's menstrual cycle. However, the sentence in question refers to the growth back of a human uterus after a full hysterectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove the entire uterus. These two concepts are different. The monthly regeneration of the uterine lining for menstruation is a natural process that occurs continuously throughout a woman's reproductive years, whereas the growth back of the entire organ after a hysterectomy is an abnormal and rare phenomenon. There is evidence that in some cases, the cervix and surrounding tissue can regrow to some extent after a hysterectomy, but the uterus itself does not typically regenerate. Therefore, there is no reliable evidence of a human uterus growing back after a full hysterectomy as stated in the sentence.

RESPONSES

This implies that the gum itself does not undergo significant change or harm as it moves through the digestive tract. Since the sentence "If you swallow gum, it won't harm you" is saying that swallowing gum is not harmful, it aligns with the information in the context.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that swallowed gum will be excreted from the body. This implies that swallowing gum is not harmful in the long term as the body eliminates it. However, the sentence does not explicitly state that swallowing gum "won't harm you," but rather infers it based on the fact that the gum will be excreted. The meaning of the context and the sentence are similar, but they do not entirely align. Therefore, while the context implies the truth of the sentence, the sentence itself is not an exact restatement of the context.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that swallowed gum will not be digested. However, not being digested does not automatically mean harm. Many things we consume are not fully digested but still pass through our system without causing harm. Therefore, the sentence "If you swallow gum, it won't harm you" is plausible based on the given context.

The sentence discusses the idea that climate change may lead to human extinction, which is a more extreme consequence than runaway warming. While the two ideas are related, they are not exactly the same thing. The absence of conclusive evidence for runaway warming does not necessarily mean that there is no evidence for the more extreme consequence of human extinction.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that "British people don't have bad teeth." This is a negative statement about a false belief. The sentence being evaluated also states that it's false that British people have bad teeth. Since both statements are saying the same thing, that the belief is false, and they agree on the factual content (that British people do not have bad teeth), the context supports the sentence.

#Verdict#: Yes.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that "British people don't have worse teeth than other countries." This directly contradicts the idea that British people have bad teeth, which is what the false sentence implies. Therefore, the context supports the negation of the false sentence, making the original sentence "It's false that British people have bad teeth" true in this context.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that light does not have a definite particle or wave nature. This means that it does not exhibit these properties in a consistent or definitive way at all times and in all situations. However, the sentence "Light exhibits the properties of both a particle and a wave" suggests that light behaves as both a particle and a wave under certain conditions. Since the context states that light does not have a definite particle or wave nature, it is unlikely that the sentence is supported by the context.

This means that there were once bodies present at the dam site, but they have since been moved or removed. The sentence being evaluated, however, states that "there are no bodies buried in Hoover Dam." While it is true that there are no bodies buried in Hoover Dam based on the information given, the sentence does not accurately reflect the context as a whole because the context also indicates that there were once bodies present at the dam site.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that people died during the construction of Hoover Dam, but their bodies were removed. This means that there were once bodies present at the site, but they have since been removed. The sentence "No, there are no bodies buried in Hoover Dam" is stating that there are currently no bodies in or buried within the dam. Since the context states that all the bodies were removed from the site, it follows logically that there are no bodies currently present or buried in the dam, as stated in the sentence.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that "very few (if any)" music records are illegal in France. This means that the number of illegal records is small or possibly non-existent. The sentence "No records are illegal in France" asserts that there are no illegal records at all. Since the context suggests that there may be none, the sentence is supported by the context.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that nothing happens if you step on the cracks in the pavement. However, the sentence suggests that you may trip if you step on the cracks.

#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that you may stub your toe if you step on the cracks in the pavement. Tripping implies losing balance and possibly falling, which could potentially result from stepping on a crack and causing an unexpected change in the ground surface. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that tripping is also a possible outcome of stepping on the cracks.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The children's rhyme mentioned in the context discusses the consequence of stepping on a crack, which is an old superstition and does not imply that tripping is a guaranteed outcome. The sentence "You may trip if you step on the cracks in the pavement" is stating a possibility based on the physical condition of the cracks, which is different from the superstitious meaning conveyed by the rhyme. While there might be a connection between stepping on cracks and tripping due to their unevenness or other hazards, the context above does not directly support this sentence.

It does not explicitly mention scientists or their denial, but the implication is that there is a lack of evidence to support an extraterrestrial explanation for UFOs.

The sentence "Scientists deny it because it is most likely false" implies that there is no evidence to support the claim that UFOs are extraterrestrial, and scientists are denying this claim due to its lack of credibility.

RESPONSES

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that "I am a teacher." This means that the speaker is a human being who holds the profession of teaching. Therefore, the sentence "I am a human" is tautologically true because the definition of being a human already implies being a living organism. However, since the context explicitly states that the speaker is a human (as a teacher), there is no new information added to the context by the sentence "I am a human."

The sentence "I am a human" is a basic statement of fact that all humans are. While it is true that humans can be computer programmers, the sentence does not provide any additional information beyond the fact that the speaker is human.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context above states that "nothing in particular happens to class attendance" if video recordings of lectures are provided. This implies that there is no significant change in class attendance one way or another when video recordings are available. The sentence "there is no strong evidence showing that class attendance drops" aligns with this idea as it also suggests that the provision of video recordings does not lead to a noticeable decrease in class attendance.

#Verdict#: Yes.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context mentions summoning the four elements (earth, air, water, fire) and does not mention demons. Demons are supernatural beings, distinct from the natural elements. Therefore, the sentence "You will summon demons" is not supported by the context.

#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that you will protect yourself against evil forces. Summoning demons is not a protective measure and can be considered an action that invites evil forces. Therefore, the sentence "You will summon demons" is not supported by the context above.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that "you will go to hell." Summoning demons is typically considered an act associated with going to hell in various religious and mythological traditions. However, the sentence "You will summon demons" goes beyond what is stated in the context, as it specifically mentions the action of summoning demons, which is not explicitly mentioned in the context.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context does not provide any information regarding the percentage of the US Federal budget spent on foreign aid. Therefore, there is no direct evidence to support or refute the sentence. However, the sentence itself is a factual statement that is commonly accepted. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), as of 2020, the United States was the largest donor of foreign aid but only contributed around 0.13% of its gross national income to it. Given that the US Federal budget is approximately equivalent to its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), this percentage can be roughly translated into a comparable percentage of the Federal budget.
#Verdict#: Yes.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that "less than 1%" and "only a small part" refer to the percentage of the US Federal budget spent on foreign aid to poor countries. Since both statements convey the same information, they are interchangeable and support each other. Therefore, the sentence is supported by the context.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context mentions that James Watson and Francis Crick won the Nobel Prize. The sentence under consideration states that they were born in the United States and won a Nobel Prize for Physiology. Since the context confirms that they did win a Nobel Prize, it is reasonable to assume that they were also born in the United States if that information is true. However, there is no explicit statement in the context that they were both born in the United States. Without this confirmation, we cannot definitively say that the sentence is supported by the context alone.
#Verdict#: Partially Supported. The context supports the second part of the sentence (they won a Nobel Prize), but it does not provide enough information to confirm the first part (they were born in the United States).

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context mentions that Konrad Lorenz won the Nobel Prize, but it does not specify which prize he won or in which field. James Watson and Francis Crick are mentioned as people born in the United States who won a Nobel Prize for Physiology. Therefore, the sentence about James Watson and Francis Crick is unrelated to Konrad Lorenz and his Nobel Prize, and the context does not provide enough information to support or refute the sentence about them.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: Francis Crick was awarded the Nobel Prize, but the sentence specifically mentions the prize being for Physiology. While Crick's work was in the field of molecular biology, which is related to physiology, the actual Nobel Prize he received was for Medicine or Physiology, not Physiology alone. However, James Watson and Francis Crick are both mentioned in the sentence as people born in the United States who won a Nobel Prize for Physiology, so in that sense, the sentence is correct in including them.
#Verdict#: Yes, but with some caveats regarding the specificity of the prize category mentioned.

Use the following format in your response.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context mentions that a frivolous lawsuit "may lack factual claims or demand extreme remedies." It does not explicitly state that such a lawsuit "lacks a legal argument." However, the lack of a legal argument is sometimes a characteristic of a frivolous lawsuit. For example, a lawsuit with no basis in law or no reasonable chance of success might be considered frivolous. Based on this reasoning, it seems possible that the sentence could be supported by the context if we interpret "lacks a legal argument" as an implicit part of the definition of a frivolous lawsuit.

RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that a frivolous lawsuit has "no legal basis." The term "legal basis" refers to the existence of valid and sustainable grounds or reasons for a claim or suit. In other words, it means that there should be some argument or reasoning based on existing laws that support the lawsuit. Therefore, if a lawsuit lacks a legal argument, it also means that it has no legal basis, making the sentence "If a lawsuit is frivolous, it lacks a legal argument" synonymous with "If a lawsuit is frivolous, it has no legal basis," as stated in the context.

>> #Context#: Yes, Earth's gravity on the International Space Station is around 90 percent of the gravity on the Earth's surface
#Sentence#:  Yes, there is gravity on the International Space Station
Is the sentence supported by the context above?
Explain your step-by-step reasoning process.
Finally, taking into account your previous reasoning, is the sentence supported by the context above? Answer only Yes or No. Do not add any extra explanation.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that the gravity on the International Space Station is around 90 percent of the gravity on Earth's surface. Gravity is a force that pulls objects towards each other. The presence of gravity indicates that there is some mass present, which in turn implies the existence of a gravitational field. Since the ISS has its own gravitational field, it follows that there is gravity on the International Space Station.

#Verdict#: Yes
PROMPTS
>> #Context#:  Yes, there is gravity everywhere in space
#Sentence#:  Yes, there is gravity on the International Space Station
Is the sentence supported by the context above?
Explain your step-by-step reasoning process.
Finally, taking into account your previous reasoning, is the sentence supported by the context above? Answer only Yes or No. Do not add any extra explanation.

Use the following format in your response.
#Reasoning#: <your reasoning process>
#Verdict#: <Yes if it is supported, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>>  #Reasoning#: The context states that "yes, there is gravity everywhere in space." The International Space Station (ISS) is a large object in space. Gravity pulls objects towards each other, so there is gravity between the ISS and other massive objects like Earth. Therefore, it follows logically that there would be some gravity present on the ISS as well.
#Verdict#: Yes.
PROMPTS
>> #Context#:  It is a misconception that there is no gravity on the ISS. It is actually around 90 percent of the gravity on Earth
