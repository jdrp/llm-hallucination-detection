#Question#: What was the unknown diagnosis code given to the patient on admission?
#Answer#: unknown diagnosis code

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Report Text: **institution operative report name: **name[aaa, bbb] acct #: **id-num mrn: **id-num date of procedure: **date[mar 24 2006] admitted: **date[mar 24 2007] surgeon: **name[yyy zzz], md diagnosis: degenerative arthritis, right hip. procedure: right minimally invasive total hip replacement under spinal anesthesia, image intensification. assistant: **name[xxx www], pa-c history: for several years this woman has experienced insidious onset and progression of pain in her right hip that became incapacitating despite conservative treatment. recent clinical and radiographic features were consistent with severe degenerative arthritis of the right hip. recommendation was made for right minimally invasive total hip replacement. the risks, complications, and therapeutic options were reviewed. the patient was agreeable to proceed. technique: the patient was draped and prepped in usual sterile fashion under spinal anesthesia. she was placed supine with an inflatable pad elevated under her right hip. with image intensification, the site for an oblique 5-cm incision anterior to the intertrochanteric ridge of the right proximal femur was identified. the incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia. a few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized. curved scissors was used to bluntly develop the interval between tensor and sartorius down to the underlying hip capsule. the traversing lateral circumflex vessels were identified, clamped, cauterized, and divided. the hip capsule was incised with the electrocautery along the axis of the femoral neck with supplementary releases around the acetabular rim, and along the intertrochanteric ridge. hip retractors were placed deep to the capsule. observation confirmed features of severe degenerative arthritis of the femoral head with complete erosion of articular cartilage and osteophytes. with image intensification, the site for a standard osteotomy of the proximal femur was identified. the osteotomy was completed with a reciprocal saw, along with a parallel cut through the equator of the femoral head. the neck fragment was impaled with a schanz screw to extract it. the head fragment was grasped with a bone clamp to remove it. the labrum was sharply excised. the acetabulum was debrided with curettes and rongeurs. periodically, profuse antibiotic irrigation with jet lavage was performed. the acetabulum was reamed incrementally with hemispherical reamers through size 54 mm. with imaging, a **name[vvv] trabecular metal shell of 54 mm was selected. the shell was inserted into the acetabulum on the aligning tool and impacted. supplementary anchorage was achieved with 2 of the 6.5 mm cancellous screws inserted into 3.2-mm drill holes with the use of a depth gauge. solid fixation of the shell was documented. a 10-degree anterior wall elevated polyethylene liner was impacted into the metal backing. attention was turned to the proximal femur. initially, the contralateral left hip was hyperextended by adjustment of the jupiter table. the right lower extremity was placed in the figure-of-four position. a box chisel was used on the osteotomized femoral neck. a 1 cm square of capsule was sharply excised from the lateral aspect of the neck. curved scissors was used to incise the capsule above the neck. lines were drawn on the thigh to identify the site for the second 3-cm incision high in the lateral aspect of the hip. the incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia. a few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized. curved scissors were used to bluntly develop a tunnel through gluteus maximus into the hip joint. the 3 sizers of hip dilator were used to enlarge the tunnel. a pointed awl was used to impale the osteotomized femoral neck. a ball-ended guidewire was passed down the femoral canal for flexible reaming incrementally through 14 mm. the versys solid reamers and rasps were used incrementally through size 14. the last was rotationally stable. imaging confirmed appropriate fit and fill and axial alignment. the rasp was removed with pulsatile jet lavage. a size 14 epic stem was inserted into the second incision while viewed through the anterior incision. it was fully impacted in place where it was stable. trial reduction was satisfactorily performed with a minus 3.5-mm neck and 32-mm head. equality of limb length and stability of the hip were confirmed. the hip was dislocated for replacement of the trial head with a comparable definitive metallic head by impaction with the **name[uuu] taper. final reduction was performed. hard copy images were obtained. pulsatile jet lavage was completed. a small hemovac drain was inserted. the deep fascia was closed with interrupted 0 vicryl. the subcutaneous layers and skin were closed with resorbable sutures in conventional fashion. steri-strips, dry, and opsite dressings were added. the patient tolerated the procedure well, and was transferred to the recovery room in good condition.

#Question#: Why was the patient experiencing bradycardia?
#Answer#: Suspected increased vagal tone due to nausea and/or pain

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.

#Question#: What are the patient's assessment and recommendations?
#Answer#: Check urine studies, renal ultrasound with postvoid residuals, PTH level, 24-hour urine for creatinine clearance and protein, check creatinine kinase; dose medications for low creatinine clearance; avoid nephrotoxins

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:


#Sentence#: <first sentence in the answer>
#Context passage#: <the relevant passage, or None if not found>

Report Text: **institution emergency department patient name: **name[aaa, bbb m] account #: **id-num date of service: **date[apr 08 06] primary care physician: **name[www m xxx] attending physician addendum: the history, examination, and emergency department plan and care were reviewed with the resident. i agree with the contents of the resident's dictation. i have also personally evaluated this patient. chief complaint: weakness. history of present illness: the patient is a **age[in 70s]-year-old woman who has had diarrhea over the last five days. she says this started as a gastrointestinal illness approximately five days ago. she had several days of bad diarrhea and, after discussion with her primary care physician over the telephone, was started on ciprofloxacin in the last several days. she says she has only had one bowel movement per day today and yesterday, so from that perspective, her diarrhea is decreasing in frequency, but today, she noticed worsening weakness to the point that she was quite lightheaded and unsteady on her feet. she has not noted any rectal blood. she has not had any significant abdominal discomfort, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, dysuria, urgency, frequency, any new extremity pains or swelling, or other acute complaints. the remainder of the review of systems is as per the resident's dictation and is otherwise negative. past medical history, medications, allergies, and social history are as per the resident's dictation. physical exam: generally, this is a comfortable-appearing woman in no respiratory distress. she is quite pleasant to talk to. vital signs are as per the resident's dictation. heent - head is without external evidence of trauma. sclerae are anicteric. nose and mouth are normal with moist mucous membranes. neck is supple; no jvd. lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. heart - regular rate and rhythm, no murmur. abdomen is soft and nontender. no rebound or guarding is present. extremities - nontender, no edema, no calf pain. neurologic - the patient is alert and oriented. strength is intact in all extremities without focal deficits. her gait was steady. assessment: this is a **age[in 70s]-year-old woman with general weakness today in the setting of five days of what initially started as a gastrointestinal illness and subsequently has been just loose stools over the last several days. she started antibiotics only after the onset of the diarrhea so our suspicion for c. difficile is relatively low. additionally, her diarrhea has been improving to the point that she has only had one episode per day each of the last few days. her appetite and oral intake continue to be quite poor; however, my suspicion is that dehydration is the primary etiology of her weakness. emergency department course: laboratory studies were obtained with complete results as per the resident's dictation. cbc was also obtained which was remarkable for a normal white blood count with a normal differential. the patient received iv hydration here and was also able to hydrate orally. she urinated several times, and her urine dip was negative for evidence of infection. her symptoms improved dramatically. she had no further bowel movements here. at this point, since she is feeling better and our suspicion for the etiology of her symptoms is dehydration, we have encouraged her to increase her oral fluid intake. she will finish her course of ciprofloxacin, and i anticipate her discharge home for followup with her primary physician, dr. **name[xxx]. we also did speak with dr. **name[xxx] while she was here as well. discharge diagnosis(es): 1. diarrhea and dehydration. 2. general weakness secondary to dehydration.

diagnosis: degenerative arthritis, right hip. procedure: right minimally invasive total hip replacement under spinal anesthesia, image intensification. assistant: **name[xxx www], pa-c history: for several years this woman has experienced insidious onset and progression of pain in her right hip that became incapacitating despite conservative treatment. recent clinical and radiographic features were consistent with severe degenerative arthritis of the right hip. recommendation was made for right minimally invasive total hip replacement. the risks, complications, and therapeutic options were reviewed. the patient was agreeable to proceed. technique: the patient was draped and prepped in usual sterile fashion under spinal anesthesia. she was placed supine with an inflatable pad elevated under her right hip. with image intensification, the site for an oblique 5-cm incision anterior to the intertrochanteric ridge of the right proximal femur was identified. the incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia. a few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized. curved scissors was used to bluntly develop the interval between tensor and sartorius down to the underlying hip capsule. the traversing lateral circumflex vessels were identified, clamped, cauterized, and divided. the hip capsule was incised with the electrocautery along the axis of the femoral neck with supplementary releases around the acetabular rim, and along the intertrochanteric ridge. hip retractors were placed deep to the capsule. observation confirmed features of severe degenerative arthritis of the femoral head with complete erosion of articular cartilage and osteophytes. with image intensification, the site for a standard osteotomy of the proximal femur was identified. the osteotomy was completed with a reciprocal saw, along with a parallel cut through the equator of the femoral head. the neck fragment was impaled with a schanz screw to extract it. the head fragment was grasped with a bone clamp to remove it. the labrum was sharply excised. the acetabulum was debrided with curettes and rongeurs. periodically, profuse antibiotic irrigation with jet lavage was performed. the acetabulum was reamed incrementally with hemispherical reamers through size 54 mm. with imaging, a **name[vvv] trabecular metal shell of 54 mm was selected. the shell was inserted into the acetabulum on the aligning tool and impacted. supplementary anchorage was achieved with 2 of the 6.5 mm cancellous screws inserted into 3.2-mm drill holes with the use of a depth gauge. solid fixation of the shell was documented. a 10-degree anterior wall elevated polyethylene liner was impacted into the metal backing. attention was turned to the proximal femur. initially, the contralateral left hip was hyperextended by adjustment of the jupiter table. the right lower extremity was placed in the figure-of-four position. a box chisel was used on the osteotomized femoral neck. a 1 cm square of capsule was sharply excised from the lateral aspect of the neck. curved scissors was used to incise the capsule above the neck. lines were drawn on the thigh to identify the site for the second 3-cm incision high in the lateral aspect of the hip. the incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia. a few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized. curved scissors were used to bluntly develop a tunnel through gluteus maximus into the hip joint. the 3 sizers of hip dilator were used to enlarge the tunnel. a pointed awl was used to impale the osteotomized femoral neck. a ball-ended guidewire was passed down the femoral canal for flexible reaming incrementally through 14 mm. the versys solid reamers and rasps were used incrementally through size 14. the last was rotationally stable. imaging confirmed appropriate fit and fill and axial alignment. the rasp was removed with pulsatile jet lavage. a size 14 epic stem was inserted into the second incision while viewed through the anterior incision. it was fully impacted in place where it was stable. trial reduction was satisfactorily performed with a minus 3.5-mm neck and 32-mm head. equality of limb length and stability of the hip were confirmed. the hip was dislocated for replacement of the trial head with a comparable definitive metallic head by impaction with the **name[uuu] taper. final reduction was performed. hard copy images were obtained. pulsatile jet lavage was completed. a small hemovac drain was inserted. the deep fascia was closed with interrupted 0 vicryl. the subcutaneous layers and skin were closed with resorbable sutures in conventional fashion. steri-strips, dry, and opsite dressings were added. the patient tolerated the procedure well, and was transferred to the recovery room in good condition.


#Question#: What type of anesthesia was used during the procedure?
#Answer#: General anesthesia

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:

#Question#: What was the patient's diagnosis prior to arrival at the hospital?
#Answer#: Stroke with left-sided weakness

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:


#Sentence#: <first sentence in the answer>

Report Text: **institution emergency department patient name: **name[aaa, bbb m] account #: **id-num date of service: **date[apr 02 06] primary care physician: **name[ttt sss rrr] chief complaint: chest pain and cough expectoration. history of present illness: this is a **age[in 40s]-year-old lady with a past medical history of hypercoagulable state and multiple pulmonary embolisms, chronically on coumadin, who presented to the hospital with left-sided chest pain. as per the patient, her pain began two years back. it is pleuritic in nature. the pain is an 8/10 in intensity. it is persistent in timing. it is exacerbated by taking a deep breath or coughing, and there are no relieving factors. the pain does not radiate to the arms or the jaw. the pain is not associated with perspiration or nausea. she also is giving a history of having a cough with yellowish to greenish-colored expectoration. the expectoration is minimal in amount. she has not seen blood in the expectorant. she denies any fevers or chills. she denies any sick contacts. review of systems: she denies any nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea. she denies any abdominal pain. she denies any swelling of her extremities. she denies any bleeding from any other site of the body. past medical history: 1 factor v leiden mutation. 2 hypercoagulable. 3 pulmonary embolism three times. 4 history of . 5 chronic low back pain. allergies: morphine which gives her hives. medications: she is on coumadin 5 mg q.p.m. for the last two days. before that, she was taking 7.5 mg. she has been managing her coumadin herself. because of lack of insurance, she is not able to go to the **institution. social history: she has been a smoker in the past but apparently has decreased that recently. she denies alcohol, drugs or tattoos. she is currently separated. family history: her mother had bladder cancer. her mother also had coronary artery disease and diabetes. her father had lung cancer. physical exam: general: the patient is comfortable in the bed. she does not look in any acute cardiopulmonary distress. vital signs: afebrile. pulse is 80 and regular, and blood pressure is 120/84. 100% on room air. respiratory rate is 16. heent: perrl. eomi. no jugular venous distention or cervical lymphadenopathy. chest: clear to auscultation bilaterally. cardiovascular system: s1 and s2 normal. no rubs, gallops or murmurs. abdomen: soft, nontender, and nondistended. bowel sounds are present and are normal. lower extremities: no swelling, no erythema, no clubbing, no cyanosis, no edema. test is negative. neurologic: neurologic examination is nonfocal. musculoskeletal: she does not have tenderness over the ribs. no musculoskeletal abnormalities seen. ed course: this is a **age[in 40s]-year-old patient with a history of multiple pulmonary embolisms due to hypercoagulable state because of factor v leiden mutation. this was diagnosed apparently in 2000 following an episode of pulmonary embolism. she has been on coumadin on and off. she is known to have a history of being noncompliant with coumadin. in the ed, she was hemodynamically stable, but given the fact that she has issues with compliance, we were concerned about the possibility of a pulmonary embolism because of under-anticoagulation. we checked her inr and it was 1.1. we obtained a ct scan of the chest with iv dye using the pe protocol. the scan was adequate and did not show any evidence of pulmonary embolism. i discussed the clinical picture of the patient with dr. **name[ttt rrr] who has seen the patient in the past with the resident. dr. **name[rrr] apparently knows the patient very well and tells me that the patient has had multiple scans in the last few years where the preliminary read was that the patient might have a pulmonary embolism, and she had been diagnosed with factor v leiden mutation at a different hospital. she did have her factor v leiden mutation checked in our hospital recently, and it was normal. she was homozygous for the mutation. as per dr. **name[rrr]'s opinion, the patient does not have factor v leiden mutation, and all of her ct scans that have been done in the **institution system have been negative for pulmonary embolism. she did tell me that the medicine team was planning to take her off her anticoagulation and repeat the whole battery of hypercoagulable state. she does have an appointment with dr. **name[qqq ppp] on **date[apr 03] at 3:20 p.m. dr. **name[rrr] was comfortable with us sending the patient home if we did not think that the patient was in any sort of hemodynamic compromise. she was planning to repeat the whole battery tomorrow when the patient is in the clinic. i discussed the case, and in my discussion with dr. **name[zzz], who was the supervising attending, he agreed with the patient going home. the patient did not have any fevers. she is not tachypneic. she is not having tachycardia. her chest pain started after she started having a cough. her x-ray did not show any infiltrates or any pneumothorax. she had a ct scan on which there was no airspace disease. the patient will be discharged on ibuprofen 400 mg q. 6 hours for pain control and will be given five vicodin to be used for the breakthrough pain. she has also been given robitussin-cf to be used three times a day to help with the congestion. she has been advised to follow up with dr. **name[rrr] and dr. **name[ppp] tomorrow at 3:20 p.m. in the department of medicine. the patient did understand all of this and was very cooperative. she was advised that if she has further chest pain which is not getting better, if she has increasing shortness of breath or if she is having fevers with chills, she should come back to the ed or call an ambulance. this cased was supervised by dr. **name[zzz], and he was in agreement with the plan.


#Question#: Why was the patient's factor V Leiden mutation re-checked?

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

diagnosis: degenerative arthritis, right hip. procedure: right minimally invasive total hip replacement under spinal anesthesia, image intensification. assistant: **name[xxx www], pa-c history: for several years this woman has experienced insidious onset and progression of pain in her right hip that became incapacitating despite conservative treatment. recent clinical and radiographic features were consistent with severe degenerative arthritis of the right hip. recommendation was made for right minimally invasive total hip replacement. the risks, complications, and therapeutic options were reviewed. the patient was agreeable to proceed. technique: the patient was draped and prepped in usual sterile fashion under spinal anesthesia. she was placed supine with an inflatable pad elevated under her right hip. with image intensification, the site for an oblique 5-cm incision anterior to the intertrochanteric ridge of the right proximal femur was identified. the incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia. a few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized. curved scissors was used to bluntly develop the interval between tensor and sartorius down to the underlying hip capsule. the traversing lateral circumflex vessels were identified, clamped, cauterized, and divided. the hip capsule was incised with the electrocautery along the axis of the femoral neck with supplementary releases around the acetabular rim, and along the intertrochanteric ridge. hip retractors were placed deep to the capsule. observation confirmed features of severe degenerative arthritis of the femoral head with complete erosion of articular cartilage and osteophytes. with image intensification, the site for a standard osteotomy of the proximal femur was identified. the osteotomy was completed with a reciprocal saw, along with a parallel cut through the equator of the femoral head. the neck fragment was impaled with a schanz screw to extract it. the head fragment was grasped with a bone clamp to remove it. the labrum was sharply excised. the acetabulum was debrided with curettes and rongeurs. periodically, profuse antibiotic irrigation with jet lavage was performed. the acetabulum was reamed incrementally with hemispherical reamers through size 54 mm. with imaging, a **name[vvv] trabecular metal shell of 54 mm was selected. the shell was inserted into the acetabulum on the aligning tool and impacted. supplementary anchorage was achieved with 2 of the 6.5 mm cancellous screws inserted into 3.2-mm drill holes with the use of a depth gauge. solid fixation of the shell was documented. a 10-degree anterior wall elevated polyethylene liner was impacted into the metal backing. attention was turned to the proximal femur. initially, the contralateral left hip was hyperextended by adjustment of the jupiter table. the right lower extremity was placed in the figure-of-four position. a box chisel was used on the osteotomized femoral neck. a 1 cm square of capsule was sharply excised from the lateral aspect of the neck. curved scissors was used to incise the capsule above the neck. lines were drawn on the thigh to identify the site for the second 3-cm incision high in the lateral aspect of the hip. the incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia. a few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized. curved scissors were used to bluntly develop a tunnel through gluteus maximus into the hip joint. the 3 sizers of hip dilator were used to enlarge the tunnel. a pointed awl was used to impale the osteotomized femoral neck. a ball-ended guidewire was passed down the femoral canal for flexible reaming incrementally through 14 mm. the versys solid reamers and rasps were used incrementally through size 14. the last was rotationally stable. imaging confirmed appropriate fit and fill and axial alignment. the rasp was removed with pulsatile jet lavage. a size 14 epic stem was inserted into the second incision while viewed through the anterior incision. it was fully impacted in place where it was stable. trial reduction was satisfactorily performed with a minus 3.5-mm neck and 32-mm head. equality of limb length and stability of the hip were confirmed. the hip was dislocated for replacement of the trial head with a comparable definitive metallic head by impaction with the **name[uuu] taper. final reduction was performed. hard copy images were obtained. pulsatile jet lavage was completed. a small hemovac drain was inserted. the deep fascia was closed with interrupted 0 vicryl. the subcutaneous layers and skin were closed with resorbable sutures in conventional fashion. steri-strips, dry, and opsite dressings were added. the patient tolerated the procedure well, and was transferred to the recovery room in good condition.

Report Text: **institution emergency department patient name: **name[aaa, bbb m] account #: **id-num date of service: **date[apr 02 06] primary care physician: **name[ttt sss rrr] chief complaint: chest pain and cough expectoration. history of present illness: this is a **age[in 40s]-year-old lady with a past medical history of hypercoagulable state and multiple pulmonary embolisms, chronically on coumadin, who presented to the hospital with left-sided chest pain. as per the patient, her pain began two years back. it is pleuritic in nature. the pain is an 8/10 in intensity. it is persistent in timing. it is exacerbated by taking a deep breath or coughing, and there are no relieving factors. the pain does not radiate to the arms or the jaw. the pain is not associated with perspiration or nausea. she also is giving a history of having a cough with yellowish to greenish-colored expectoration. the expectoration is minimal in amount. she has not seen blood in the expectorant. she denies any fevers or chills. she denies any sick contacts. review of systems: she denies any nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea. she denies any abdominal pain. she denies any swelling of her extremities. she denies any bleeding from any other site of the body. past medical history: 1 factor v leiden mutation. 2 hypercoagulable. 3 pulmonary embolism three times. 4 history of . 5 chronic low back pain. allergies: morphine which gives her hives. medications: she is on coumadin 5 mg q.p.m. for the last two days. before that, she was taking 7.5 mg. she has been managing her coumadin herself. because of lack of insurance, she is not able to go to the **institution. social history: she has been a smoker in the past but apparently has decreased that recently. she denies alcohol, drugs or tattoos. she is currently separated. family history: her mother had bladder cancer. her mother also had coronary artery disease and diabetes. her father had lung cancer. physical exam: general: the patient is comfortable in the bed. she does not look in any acute cardiopulmonary distress. vital signs: afebrile. pulse is 80 and regular, and blood pressure is 120/84. 100% on room air. respiratory rate is 16. heent: perrl. eomi. no jugular venous distention or cervical lymphadenopathy. chest: clear to auscultation bilaterally. cardiovascular system: s1 and s2 normal. no rubs, gallops or murmurs. abdomen: soft, nontender, and nondistended. bowel sounds are present and are normal. lower extremities: no swelling, no erythema, no clubbing, no cyanosis, no edema. test is negative. neurologic: neurologic examination is nonfocal. musculoskeletal: she does not have tenderness over the ribs. no musculoskeletal abnormalities seen. ed course: this is a **age[in 40s]-year-old patient with a history of multiple pulmonary embolisms due to hypercoagulable state because of factor v leiden mutation. this was diagnosed apparently in 2000 following an episode of pulmonary embolism. she has been on coumadin on and off. she is known to have a history of being noncompliant with coumadin. in the ed, she was hemodynamically stable, but given the fact that she has issues with compliance, we were concerned about the possibility of a pulmonary embolism because of under-anticoagulation. we checked her inr and it was 1.1. we obtained a ct scan of the chest with iv dye using the pe protocol. the scan was adequate and did not show any evidence of pulmonary embolism. i discussed the clinical picture of the patient with dr. **name[ttt rrr] who has seen the patient in the past with the resident. dr. **name[rrr] apparently knows the patient very well and tells me that the patient has had multiple scans in the last few years where the preliminary read was that the patient might have a pulmonary embolism, and she had been diagnosed with factor v leiden mutation at a different hospital. she did have her factor v leiden mutation checked in our hospital recently, and it was normal. she was homozygous for the mutation. as per dr. **name[rrr]'s opinion, the patient does not have factor v leiden mutation, and all of her ct scans that have been done in the **institution system have been negative for pulmonary embolism. she did tell me that the medicine team was planning to take her off her anticoagulation and repeat the whole battery of hypercoagulable state. she does have an appointment with dr. **name[qqq ppp] on **date[apr 03] at 3:20 p.m. dr. **name[rrr] was comfortable with us sending the patient home if we did not think that the patient was in any sort of hemodynamic compromise. she was planning to repeat the whole battery tomorrow when the patient is in the clinic. i discussed the case, and in my discussion with dr. **name[zzz], who was the supervising attending, he agreed with the patient going home. the patient did not have any fevers. she is not tachypneic. she is not having tachycardia. her chest pain started after she started having a cough. her x-ray did not show any infiltrates or any pneumothorax. she had a ct scan on which there was no airspace disease. the patient will be discharged on ibuprofen 400 mg q. 6 hours for pain control and will be given five vicodin to be used for the breakthrough pain. she has also been given robitussin-cf to be used three times a day to help with the congestion. she has been advised to follow up with dr. **name[rrr] and dr. **name[ppp] tomorrow at 3:20 p.m. in the department of medicine. the patient did understand all of this and was very cooperative. she was advised that if she has further chest pain which is not getting better, if she has increasing shortness of breath or if she is having fevers with chills, she should come back to the ed or call an ambulance. this cased was supervised by dr. **name[zzz], and he was in agreement with the plan.


#Question#: What is the result of the CT scan with IV dye?
#Answer#: no evidence of pulmonary embolism

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.

Report Text: **institution consultation name: **name[aaa, bbb] acct #: **id-num mrn: **id-num admitted: date: **date[mar 14 2006] dict: **name[xxx, www] attend: **name[zzz, yyy] reason for consult: sarcoid, possible pneumonia. history of present illness: **name[bbb aaa] is a **age[in 40s]-year-old female who gives about a 16 or 17-year history of sarcoid. she has had chronic skin rash, and biopsy showed granulomas consistent with sarcoid. this was in the early 1999. these were possibly in 1990. she later had a breast lump. evidently, this showed granulomatous inflammation as well and it was thought to be secondary to sarcoid. she is currently admitted to the hospital because of flank pain, difficulty urinating, weight loss and anorexia. she has also had weakness, fatigue, and questionable syncopal episode. the patient has a long complicated gi history including a subtotal gastrectomy and chronic dumping syndrome with malnutrition for which she has been on home pt for many years. she has a variety of electrolyte disturbances and micronutrient disturbances related to her tpn and questionable compliance. according to the patient, she has tpn, but has not been using it the last 5 to 6 days at home. from a pulmonary standpoint, she has had previous pneumonia. she denies cough or sputum. she has had some left-sided chest pain over the years. she remembers being told that she had sarcoid predominantly in the left lung previously but evidently she has not had pulmonary followup that she can recall. past medical history: past medical history is notable for cholecystectomy, appendectomy, chronic hepatitis, osteoporosis, and the above mentioned sarcoid, and gi-related problems. social history: the patient smokes about a half-a-pack a day. she quit for 2 years, but has been smoking for over 2 years. family history: positive for crohn's disease, but negative for lung disease including sarcoid. **institution: medications at home include tpn nightly, advair which she uses intermittently, paxil, percocet, toprol, and folic acid. review of systems: review of systems is notable for weight loss. she denies cough or sputum. she has had intermittent shortness of breath which she says caused her to quit smoking, evidently it must have gotten better as she resumed smoking. she has a negative cardiac history except for questionable palpitations. she has chronic skin condition. she is allergic toradol and ivp dye. physical examination: a thin anxious female who was in no acute distress. she has been febrile previously, but currently was afebrile. respirations 20 on room air with saturations in 94%. heent exam was normal. the lungs revealed a few rales at the bases, left greater than right. there were no wheezes. cardiac exam revealed a normal s1 and s2. there was a port over the right anterior chest. the abdomen revealed well healed surgical scar. there was no edema of the extremities. chest x-ray suggested left lower lung infiltrate. the lung windows of the ct scan of the abdomen showed more nodular infiltrate in the left lower lobe in bronchovascular distribution consistent with a sarcoid. white blood count was 12,600, hemoglobin 8.2. my impression is that **name[bbb aaa] is a **age[in 40s]-year-old female with longstanding sarcoid without significant pulmonary involvement clinically, but ct scan evidence that suggests sarcoid more so than acute pneumonia. at this point, i recommend we deal with her gi issues. when she is feeling better, i would get complete pulmonary function tests and a ct scan of the chest without contrast for baseline data collection. at this point, i am not convinced that she has an acute pneumonia.


#Question#: What were the patient's medications at home?
#Answer#: Antibiotics, antihistamines, and ibuprofen

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Report Text: **institution consultation name: **name[aaa, bbb] acct #: **id-num mrn: **id-num admitted: date: **date[mar 14 2006] dict: **name[xxx, www] attend: **name[zzz, yyy] reason for consult: sarcoid, possible pneumonia. history of present illness: **name[bbb aaa] is a **age[in 40s]-year-old female who gives about a 16 or 17-year history of sarcoid. she has had chronic skin rash, and biopsy showed granulomas consistent with sarcoid. this was in the early 1999. these were possibly in 1990. she later had a breast lump. evidently, this showed granulomatous inflammation as well and it was thought to be secondary to sarcoid. she is currently admitted to the hospital because of flank pain, difficulty urinating, weight loss and anorexia. she has also had weakness, fatigue, and questionable syncopal episode. the patient has a long complicated gi history including a subtotal gastrectomy and chronic dumping syndrome with malnutrition for which she has been on home pt for many years. she has a variety of electrolyte disturbances and micronutrient disturbances related to her tpn and questionable compliance. according to the patient, she has tpn, but has not been using it the last 5 to 6 days at home. from a pulmonary standpoint, she has had previous pneumonia. she denies cough or sputum. she has had some left-sided chest pain over the years. she remembers being told that she had sarcoid predominantly in the left lung previously but evidently she has not had pulmonary followup that she can recall. past medical history: past medical history is notable for cholecystectomy, appendectomy, chronic hepatitis, osteoporosis, and the above mentioned sarcoid, and gi-related problems. social history: the patient smokes about a half-a-pack a day. she quit for 2 years, but has been smoking for over 2 years. family history: positive for crohn's disease, but negative for lung disease including sarcoid. **institution: medications at home include tpn nightly, advair which she uses intermittently, paxil, percocet, toprol, and folic acid. review of systems: review of systems is notable for weight loss. she denies cough or sputum. she has had intermittent shortness of breath which she says caused her to quit smoking, evidently it must have gotten better as she resumed smoking. she has a negative cardiac history except for questionable palpitations. she has chronic skin condition. she is allergic toradol and ivp dye. physical examination: a thin anxious female who was in no acute distress. she has been febrile previously, but currently was afebrile. respirations 20 on room air with saturations in 94%. heent exam was normal. the lungs revealed a few rales at the bases, left greater than right. there were no wheezes. cardiac exam revealed a normal s1 and s2. there was a port over the right anterior chest. the abdomen revealed well healed surgical scar. there was no edema of the extremities. chest x-ray suggested left lower lung infiltrate. the lung windows of the ct scan of the abdomen showed more nodular infiltrate in the left lower lobe in bronchovascular distribution consistent with a sarcoid. white blood count was 12,600, hemoglobin 8.2. my impression is that **name[bbb aaa] is a **age[in 40s]-year-old female with longstanding sarcoid without significant pulmonary involvement clinically, but ct scan evidence that suggests sarcoid more so than acute pneumonia. at this point, i recommend we deal with her gi issues. when she is feeling better, i would get complete pulmonary function tests and a ct scan of the chest without contrast for baseline data collection. at this point, i am not convinced that she has an acute pneumonia.

You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:


#Sentence#: <first sentence in the answer>

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Report Text: **institution operative report name: **name[aaa, bbb] acct #: **id-num mrn: **id-num date of procedure: **date[mar 24 2006] admitted: **date[mar 24 2007] surgeon: **name[yyy zzz], md diagnosis: degenerative arthritis, right hip. procedure: right minimally invasive total hip replacement under spinal anesthesia, image intensification. assistant: **name[xxx www], pa-c history: for several years this woman has experienced insidious onset and progression of pain in her right hip that became incapacitating despite conservative treatment. recent clinical and radiographic features were consistent with severe degenerative arthritis of the right hip. recommendation was made for right minimally invasive total hip replacement. the risks, complications, and therapeutic options were reviewed. the patient was agreeable to proceed. technique: the patient was draped and prepped in usual sterile fashion under spinal anesthesia. she was placed supine with an inflatable pad elevated under her right hip. with image intensification, the site for an oblique 5-cm incision anterior to the intertrochanteric ridge of the right proximal femur was identified. the incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia. a few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized. curved scissors was used to bluntly develop the interval between tensor and sartorius down to the underlying hip capsule. the traversing lateral circumflex vessels were identified, clamped, cauterized, and divided. the hip capsule was incised with the electrocautery along the axis of the femoral neck with supplementary releases around the acetabular rim, and along the intertrochanteric ridge. hip retractors were placed deep to the capsule. observation confirmed features of severe degenerative arthritis of the femoral head with complete erosion of articular cartilage and osteophytes. with image intensification, the site for a standard osteotomy of the proximal femur was identified. the osteotomy was completed with a reciprocal saw, along with a parallel cut through the equator of the femoral head. the neck fragment was impaled with a schanz screw to extract it. the head fragment was grasped with a bone clamp to remove it. the labrum was sharply excised. the acetabulum was debrided with curettes and rongeurs. periodically, profuse antibiotic irrigation with jet lavage was performed. the acetabulum was reamed incrementally with hemispherical reamers through size 54 mm. with imaging, a **name[vvv] trabecular metal shell of 54 mm was selected. the shell was inserted into the acetabulum on the aligning tool and impacted. supplementary anchorage was achieved with 2 of the 6.5 mm cancellous screws inserted into 3.2-mm drill holes with the use of a depth gauge. solid fixation of the shell was documented. a 10-degree anterior wall elevated polyethylene liner was impacted into the metal backing. attention was turned to the proximal femur. initially, the contralateral left hip was hyperextended by adjustment of the jupiter table. the right lower extremity was placed in the figure-of-four position. a box chisel was used on the osteotomized femoral neck. a 1 cm square of capsule was sharply excised from the lateral aspect of the neck. curved scissors was used to incise the capsule above the neck. lines were drawn on the thigh to identify the site for the second 3-cm incision high in the lateral aspect of the hip. the incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia. a few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized. curved scissors were used to bluntly develop a tunnel through gluteus maximus into the hip joint. the 3 sizers of hip dilator were used to enlarge the tunnel. a pointed awl was used to impale the osteotomized femoral neck. a ball-ended guidewire was passed down the femoral canal for flexible reaming incrementally through 14 mm. the versys solid reamers and rasps were used incrementally through size 14. the last was rotationally stable. imaging confirmed appropriate fit and fill and axial alignment. the rasp was removed with pulsatile jet lavage. a size 14 epic stem was inserted into the second incision while viewed through the anterior incision. it was fully impacted in place where it was stable. trial reduction was satisfactorily performed with a minus 3.5-mm neck and 32-mm head. equality of limb length and stability of the hip were confirmed. the hip was dislocated for replacement of the trial head with a comparable definitive metallic head by impaction with the **name[uuu] taper. final reduction was performed. hard copy images were obtained. pulsatile jet lavage was completed. a small hemovac drain was inserted. the deep fascia was closed with interrupted 0 vicryl. the subcutaneous layers and skin were closed with resorbable sutures in conventional fashion. steri-strips, dry, and opsite dressings were added. the patient tolerated the procedure well, and was transferred to the recovery room in good condition.

#Question#: What were some of the patient's medications?
#Answer#: flomax, avodart, plavix, lipitor, toprol, lotrel, warfarin, aspirin

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

#Question#: What were some of the patient's past medical histories?
#Answer#: hypertension, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, benign prostatic hypertrophy

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:


#Sentence#: <first sentence in the answer>
#Context passage#: <the relevant passage, or None if not found>
#Hallucinated#: <Yes if there is a contradiction or if no relevant passage is found, No otherwise>
#Reasoning#: <Explain why/why not there is a hallucination>

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
