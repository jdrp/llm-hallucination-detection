>> #Context#: Myelofibrosis is a disorder of the bone marrow in which the marrow is replaced by fibrous scar tissue.
Causes
Bone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside your bones. Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow that develop into all of your blood cells. Your blood is made of:
Red blood cells (which carry oxygen to your tissues)
White blood cells (which fight infection)
Platelets (which help your blood clot)
When the bone marrow is scarred, it cannot make enough blood cells.
Anemia
, bleeding problems, and a higher risk for infections may occur.
As a result, the liver and spleen try to make some of these blood cells. This causes these organs to swell.
The cause of myelofibrosis is often unknown. There are no known risk factors. When it occurs, it often develops slowly in people over age 50. Women and men are equally affected. There is an increased occurrence of this condition in Ashkenazi Jews.
Blood and bone marrow cancers, such as myelodysplastic syndrome,
leukemia
, and lymphoma, may also cause bone marrow scarring. This is called secondary myelofibrosis.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Abdominal fullness
, pain, or feeling full before finishing a meal (because ofÂ an enlarged spleen)
Bone pain
Easy bleeding,
bruising
Fatigue
Increased likelihood of getting an infection
Pale skin
Shortness of breath
with exercise
Weight loss
Night sweats
Low grade fever
Enlarged liver
Dry cough
Itchy skin
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.
Tests that may be done include:
Complete blood count
(CBC) with blood smear to check different types of blood cells
Measuring tissue damage (
LDH enzyme level
)
Molecular testing
Bone marrow biopsy
to diagnose the condition and to check for bone marrow cancers
Treatment
Bone marrow
or stem cell transplant may improve symptoms, and may cure the disease. This treatment is usually considered for younger people.
Other treatment may involve:
Blood transfusions and medicines to correct anemia
Radiation and
chemotherapy
Targeted medicines
Removal of the spleen (
splenectomy
) if swelling causes symptoms, or to help with anemia
Outlook (Prognosis)
As the disease worsens, the bone marrow slowly stops working. Low platelet count leads to easy bleeding. Spleen swelling may get worse along with anemia.
Survival of people with primary myelofibrosis is about 5 years. But some people survive for decades.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Development of
acute myelogenous leukemia
Infections
Bleeding
Blood clots
Liver failure
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Make an appointment with your provider if you have symptoms of this disorder. Seek medical care right away for uncontrolled bleeding, shortness of breath, or jaundice (yellow skin and whites of the eyes) that gets worse.

HALLUCINATION 1
PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Shin splints occur when you have pain in the front of your lower leg. The pain of shin splints is from the inflammation of the muscles, tendons, and bone tissue around your shin. Shin splints are a common problem for runners, gymnasts, dancers, and military recruits. However, there are things you can do to heal from shin splints and prevent them from getting worse.
Causes
Shin splints are an overuse problem. You get shin splints from overloading your leg muscles, tendons or shin bone.
Most often, the activity that causes the injury is high impact and repetitive exercise of your lower legs. This is why runners, dancers, and gymnasts often get shin splints. Common situations that cause shin splints are:
Sudden change in activity level, whether it is in intensity or duration
Running, especially on hills. If you are a new runner, you are at greater risk for shin splints.
Increasing your days of training.
Increasing the intensity of training, or going a longer distance.
Doing exercise that has frequent stops and starts, such as dancing, basketball, or military training.
You are more at risk for shin splints if you:
Have flat feet or very rigid foot arches.
Work out on hard surfaces, such as running on the street or playing basketball or tennis on a hard court.
Do not wear the proper shoes.
Wear worn out shoes. Running shoes lose over half of their shock absorbing ability after 250 miles (400 kilometers) of use.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Pain in one or both legs
Sharp or dull, aching pain in the front of your shin
Pain when you push on your shins
Pain that gets worse during and after exercise
Pain that gets better with rest
If you have severe shin splints, your legs may hurt even when you are not walking.
Decrease Your Activity
Expect that you need at least 2 to 4 weeks of rest from your sport or exercise.
Avoid repetitive exercise of your lower leg for 1 to 2 weeks. Keep your activity to just the walking that you do during your regular day.
Try other low impact activities as long as you do not have pain, such as swimming, elliptical machine, or biking.
After 2 to 4 weeks, if the pain is gone, you can start your usual exercise activities. Increase your activity level slowly. If the pain returns, stop exercising right away.
Know that shin splints can take 3 to 6 months to heal completely. Do not rush back into your sport or exercise. You could injure yourself again.
Reduce Your Pain and Swelling
Things you can do to ease discomfort include:
Ice your shins. Ice several times a day for 3 days or until pain is gone.
Do stretching exercises, especially over the front part of the shin.
Take ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin to decrease swelling and to help with pain. Know these medicines have side effects and can cause ulcers and bleeding. Talk to your health care provider about how much you can take.
Use arch supports. Talk with your provider or physical therapist about wearing the proper shoes, and about special shock-absorbing insoles or orthotics to wear inside your shoes.
Work with a physical therapist. They can use therapies that may help with the pain. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your leg muscles.
How to Prevent Shin Splints
To prevent shin splints from recurring:
Be pain-free for at least 2 weeks before returning to your exercise routine.
Do not overdo your exercise routine. Do not return to your previous level of intensity. Go slower, for a shorter time. Increase your training slowly.
Warm up and stretch before and after exercise.
Ice your shins after exercise to decrease swelling.
Avoid hard surfaces.
Wear proper shoes with good support and padding.
Consider changing the surface that you train on.
Cross train and add in low impact exercise, such as swimming or biking.
When to Call the Doctor
Shin splints are most often not serious. Call your provider if:
You have pain after several weeks even with rest, icing, and pain relievers.
You are not sure whether your pain is caused by shin splints.
Swelling in your lower legs is getting worse.
Your shin is red and feels hot to the touch.
Your provider may take an x-ray or perform other tests to make sure you do not have a stress fracture. You will also be checked to make sure you do not have another shin problem, such as tendonitis or compartment syndrome.

>> #Context#: Night blindness is poor vision at night or in dim light.
Considerations
Night blindness may cause problems with driving at night. People with night blindness often have trouble seeing stars on a clear night or walking through a dark room, such as a movie theater.
These problems are often worse just after a person is in a brightly lit environment. Milder cases may just have a harder time adapting to darkness.
Causes
The causes of night blindness fall into 2 categories: treatable and nontreatable.
Treatable causes:
Cataracts
Nearsightedness
Use of certain drugs
Vitamin A deficiency
(rare)
Nontreatable causes:
Birth defects, particularly congenital stationary night blindness
Retinitis pigmentosa
Home Care
Take safety measures to prevent accidents in areas of low light. Avoid driving a car at night, unless you get your eye doctor's approval.
Vitamin A supplements may be helpful if you have a vitamin A deficiency. Ask your health care provider how much you should take, because it is possible to take too much.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
It is important to have a complete eye exam to determine the cause, which may be treatable. Contact your eye doctor if symptoms of night blindness persist or significantly affect your life.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will examine you and your eyes. The goal of the medical exam is to determine if the problem can be corrected (for example, with new glasses or
cataract removal
), or if the problem is due to something that is not treatable.
The provider may ask you questions, including:
How severe is the night blindness?
When did your symptoms start?
Did it occur suddenly or gradually?
Does it happen all the time?
Does using corrective lenses improve night vision?
Have you ever had eye surgery?
What medicines do you use?
How is your diet?
Have you recently injured your eyes or head?
Do you have a family history of
diabetes
?
Do you have other vision changes?
What other symptoms do you have?
Do you have unusual stress, anxiety, or a fear of the dark?
The eye exam will include:
Color vision testing
Pupil light reflex
Refraction
Retinal exam
Slit lamp examination
Visual acuity
Other tests may be done:
Electroretinogram
(ERG)
Visual field

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Von Gierke disease is a condition in which the body cannot break down glycogen. Glycogen is a form of sugar (glucose) that is stored in the liver and muscles. It is normally broken down into glucose to give you more energy when you need it.
Von Gierke disease is also called Type I glycogen storage disease (GSD I).
Causes
Von Gierke disease occurs when the body lacks the protein (enzyme) that releases glucose from glycogen. This causes abnormal amounts of glycogen to build up in certain tissues. When glycogen is not broken down properly, it leads to
low blood sugar
.
Von Gierke disease is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease.
Symptoms
These are symptoms of von Gierke disease:
Constant hunger and need to eat often
Easy bruising and nosebleeds
Fatigue
Irritability
Puffy cheeks, thin chest and limbs, and swollen belly
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam.
The exam may show signs of:
Delayed puberty
Enlarged liver
Gout
Inflammatory bowel disease
Liver tumors
Severe low blood sugar
Stunted growth or failure to grow
Children with this condition are usually diagnosed before age 1 year.
Tests that may be done include:
Biopsy of liver
or kidney
Blood sugar test
Genetic testing
Lactic acid blood test
Triglyceride level
Uric acid blood test
If a person has this disease, test results will show low blood sugar and high levels of lactate (produced from lactic acid), blood fats (lipids), and uric acid.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to avoid low blood sugar. Eat frequently during the day, especially foods that contain carbohydrates (starches). Older children and adults may take cornstarch by mouth to increase their carbohydrate intake.
In some children, a feeding tube is placed through their nose into the stomach throughout the night to provide sugars or uncooked cornstarch. The tube can be taken out each morning. Alternatively, a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) can be placed to deliver food directly to the stomach overnight.
A medicine to lower uric acid in the blood and decrease the risk for gout may be prescribed. Your provider may also prescribe medicines to treat kidney disease, high lipids, and to increase the cells that fight infection.
People with von Gierke disease cannot properly break down fruit or milk sugar. It is best to avoid these products.
Support Groups
More information and support for people with von Gierke disease and their families can be found at:
Association for Glycogen Storage Disease --
www.agsdus.org
Outlook (Prognosis)
With treatment, growth, puberty, and quality of life have improved for people with von Gierke disease. Those who are identified and carefully treated at a young age can live into adulthood.
Early treatment also decreases the rate of severe problems such as:
Gout
Kidney failure
Life-threatening low blood sugar
Liver tumors
Possible Complications
These complications can occur:
Frequent infection
Gout
Kidney failure
Liver tumors
Osteoporosis
(thinning bones)
Seizures
,
lethargy
, confusion due to low blood sugar
Short height
Underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics (breasts, pubic hair)
Ulcers of the mouth
or bowel
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have a family history of glycogen storage disease or early infant death due to low blood sugar.
Prevention
There is no simple way to prevent glycogen storage disease.
Couples who wish to have a baby may seek genetic counseling and testing to determine their risk for passing on von Gierke disease.

HALLUCINATION 1
PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Clubfoot is a condition that involves both the foot and lower leg in which the foot turns inward and downward. It is a congenital condition, which means it is present at birth.
Causes
Clubfoot is the most common congenital disorder of the legs. It can range from mild and flexible to severe and rigid.
The cause is not known. Most often, it occurs by itself. But the condition may be passed down through families in some cases. Risk factors include a family history of the disorder and being male. Clubfoot can also occur as part of an underlying genetic syndrome, such as
trisomy 18
.
A related problem, called positional clubfoot, is not true clubfoot. It results from a normal foot positioned abnormally while the baby is in the womb. This problem is easily corrected after birth.
Symptoms
The physical appearance of the foot may vary. One or both feet may be affected.
The foot turns inward and downward at birth and is difficult to place in the correct position. The calf muscle and foot may be slightly smaller than normal.
Exams and Tests
The disorder is identified during a physical examination.
A foot x-ray may be done. Ultrasound during the first 6 months of pregnancy can also help to identify the disorder.
Treatment
Treatment may involve moving the foot into the correct position and using a cast to keep it there. This is often done by an orthopedic specialist. Treatment should be started as early as possible, ideally, shortly after birth, when it is easiest to reshape the foot.
Gentle stretching and recasting will be done every week to improve the position of the foot. Generally, 5 to 10 casts are needed. The final cast will stay in place for 3 weeks. After the foot is in the correct position, the child will wear a special brace nearly full time for 3 months. Then, the child will wear the brace at night for 3 to 5 years.
Often, the problem is a tightened Achilles tendon, and a simple procedure is needed to release it.
Some severe cases of clubfoot will need
surgery
if other treatments do not work, or if the problem returns. The child should be monitored by your health care provider until the foot is fully grown.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome is usually good with treatment.
Possible Complications
Some defects may not be completely fixed. However, treatment can improve the appearance and function of the foot. Treatment may be less successful if the clubfoot is linked to other birth disorders.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
If your child is being treated for clubfoot, contact your provider if:
The toes swell, bleed, or change color under the cast
The cast appears to be causing significant pain
The toes disappear into the cast
The cast slides off
The foot begins to turn in again after treatment

>> #Reasoning#:
The given answer provides a definition of Hemoglobinopathy as "a group of disorders characterized by abnormal production or structure of the hemoglobin molecule." The context provided earlier also describes Hemoglobinopathy as a group of disorders that includes hemoglobin C disease, hemoglobin S-C disease, sickle cell anemia, and thalassemias. Upon reviewing the answer, I do not find any information that contradicts or deviates from the given context. The definition provided is consistent with the description of Hemoglobinopathy in the context.

#Verdict#: No

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Duodenal atresia is a condition in which the first part of the small bowel (the
duodenum
) has not developed properly. It is not open and does not allow the passage of stomach contents.
Causes
The cause of duodenal atresia is not known. It is thought to result from problems during an embryo's development. The duodenum does not change from a solid to a tube-like structure, as it normally would.
Many infants with duodenal atresia also have
Down syndrome
. Duodenal atresia is often associated with other birth defects.
Symptoms
Symptoms of duodenal atresia include:
Upper abdominal swelling (sometimes)
Early vomiting of large amounts, which may be greenish (containing
bile
)
Continued vomiting even when infant has not been fed for several hours
No bowel movements after first few meconium stools
Exams and Tests
A fetal ultrasound may show high amounts of
amniotic fluid
in the womb (
polyhydramnios
). It may also show swelling of the baby's stomach and part of the duodenum.
An
abdominal x-ray
may show air in the stomach and first part of duodenum, with no air beyond that. This is known as the double-bubble sign.
Treatment
A tube is placed to decompress the stomach. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances are corrected by providing fluids through an intravenous tube (IV, into a vein). Checking for other congenital anomalies should be done.
Surgery to correct the duodenal blockage is necessary, but not an emergency. The exact surgery will depend on the nature of the abnormality. Other problems (such as those related to Down syndrome) must be treated as appropriate.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Recovery from the duodenal atresia is expected after treatment. If not treated, the condition is deadly.
Possible Complications
These complications may occur:
Other birth defects
Dehydration
After surgery, there may be complications such as:
Swelling of the first part of the small bowel
Problems with movement through the intestines
Gastroesophageal reflux
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if your newborn is:
Feeding poorly or not at all
Vomiting (not simply spitting up) or if the vomit is green
Not urinating or having bowel movements
Prevention
There is no known prevention.

>> #Context#: Blount disease is a growth disorder of the shin bone (tibia) in which the lower leg turns inward, making it look like a bowleg.
Causes
Blount disease occurs in young children and adolescents. The cause is unknown. It is thought to be due to the effects of weight on the growth plate. The inner part of the shin bone, just below the knee, fails to develop normally.
Unlike
bowlegs
, which tend to straighten as the child develops, Blount disease slowly gets worse. It can cause severe bowing of one or both legs.
This condition is more common among African American children. It is also associated with obesity and early walking.
Symptoms
One or both of the lower legs turn inward. This is called "bowing." It may:
Look the same on both legs
Occur just below the knee
Rapidly get worse
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will examine you. This will show that the lower legs turn inward. An
x-ray of the knee
and the lower leg confirms the diagnosis.
Treatment
Braces are used to treat children who develop severe bowing before the age of 3.
Surgery is most often needed if bracesÂ do notÂ work, or if the problem is not diagnosed until the child is older. Surgery may involve cutting the shin bone to place it in the proper position. Sometimes, the bone will be lengthened as well.
Other times, surgery is done to restrict the growth of the outer half of the shin bone. This allows the child's natural growth to reverse the bowing process. This is a much smaller surgery. It works best in children with less severe symptoms who still have quite a bit of growing to do.
Outlook (Prognosis)
If the leg can be placed into the proper position, the outlook is good. The leg should work properly and look normal.
Possible Complications
Failure to treat Blount disease may lead to progressive deformity. The condition may lead to differences in leg lengths, which can result in disability if not treated.
Blount disease may come back after surgery, especially in younger children.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your child's provider if your child's leg or legs appear to be bowing. Also contact the provider if your child has bowed legs that appear to be getting worse.
Prevention
Weight loss may be helpful for overweight children.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Balanitis is swelling of the foreskin and head of the
penis
.
Causes
Balanitis is most often caused by poor hygiene in uncircumcised men. Other possible causes include:
Diseases, such as
reactive arthritis
and lichen sclerosus atrophicus
Infection
Harsh soaps
Not rinsing soap off properly while bathing
Uncontrolled diabetes
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Redness of foreskin or penis
Other rashes on the head of the penis
Foul-smelling discharge
Painful penis and foreskin
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider may diagnose the problem with only an exam. However, you may need skin tests for viruses, fungi, or bacteria. A
skin biopsy
may also be needed. An exam by a dermatologist may be helpful.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the cause of the balanitis.
Antibiotic pills or creams are used to treat balanitis that is caused by bacteria.
Steroid creams may help balanitis that occurs with skin diseases.
Anti-fungal cream will be prescribed if it is due to a fungus.
In severe cases,
circumcision
may be the best option. If you cannot pull back (retract) the foreskin to clean it, you may need to be circumcised.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most cases of balanitis can be controlled with medicated creams and good hygiene. Surgery is not needed most of the time.
Possible Complications
Long-term swelling or infection can:
Scar and narrow the opening of the penis (meatal stricture)
Make it difficult and painful to retract the foreskin to expose the tip of the penis (a condition called phimosis)
Make it difficult to move the foreskin over the head of the penis (a condition called paraphimosis)
Affect the blood supply to the tip of the penis
Increase the risk of
penile cancer
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Tell your provider if you have any signs of balanitis, including swelling of the foreskin or pain.
Prevention
Good hygiene can prevent most cases of balanitis. When you bathe, pull back the foreskin to clean and dry the area under it.

#Answer#: Antibiotic pills or creams and anti-fungal cream can be used to treat balanoposthitis.

#Reasoning#: The context provided talks about balanitis, which refers to the swelling of the foreskin and head of the penis. However, the answer mentions "balanoposthitis", which is not mentioned in the context. This suggests that the answer might be misunderstanding the question or referring to a different condition.

Furthermore, the context only mentions antibiotic pills or creams as treatment options for balanitis caused by bacteria, and steroid creams for skin diseases. There is no mention of anti-fungal cream being used to treat balanitis. Therefore, it appears that the answer contains hallucinated information, specifically the part about anti-fungal cream.

PREDICTION 0.6
--------------------
HALLUCINATION 1
PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare disease of the immune and nervous systems. It involves pale-colored hair, eyes, and skin.
Causes
Chediak-Higashi syndrome is passed down through families (inherited). It is an
autosomal recessive
disease. This means that both parents are carriers of a non-working copy of the gene. Each parent must pass their non-working gene to the child for them to show symptoms of the disease.
Defects have been found in the
LYST
(also called
CHS1
) gene. The primary defect in this disease is found in certain substances normally present in skin cells and certain white blood cells.
Symptoms
Children with this condition may have:
Silver hair, light-colored eyes (albinism)
Increased infections in the lungs, skin, and mucous membranes
Jerky eye movements (
nystagmus
)
Infection of affected children with certain viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (
EBV
), can cause a life-threatening illness resembling the blood cancer
lymphoma
called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
Other symptoms may include:
Decreased vision
Intellectual disability
Muscle weakness
Nerve problems in the limbs (
peripheral neuropathy
)
Nosebleeds or easy bruising
Numbness
Tremor
Seizures
Sensitivity to bright light (photophobia)
Unsteady walking (
ataxia
)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may show signs of a swollen spleen or liver or jaundice.
Tests that may be done include:
Complete blood count, including white blood cell count
Blood platelet count
Blood culture and smear
Brain MRI or CT
EEG
EMG
Nerve conduction tests
Treatment
There is no specific treatment for Chediak-Higashi syndrome. High doses of vitamin C may help some children whose condition is in the stable phase. Hematopoietic stem cells appear to have been successful in several patients.
Antibiotics are used to treat and, sometimes, prevent infections. Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir, and chemotherapy drugs are often used in the accelerated phase of the disease. Blood and platelet transfusions are given as needed. Surgery may be needed to drain
abscesses
in some cases.
Support Groups
More information and support for people with Chediak-Higashi syndrome and their families can be found at:
National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) --
rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/chediak-higashi-syndrome/
Outlook (Prognosis)
Death often occurs in the first 10 years of life, from long-term (chronic) infections or accelerated disease that results in the lymphoma-like illness (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis). However, some affected children have survived longer.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Frequent infections involving certain types of bacteria
Lymphoma-like cancer triggered by viral infections such as EBV
Early death
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have a family history of this disorder and you are planning to have children.
Talk to your provider if your child shows symptoms of Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
Prevention
Genetic counseling is recommended before becoming pregnant if you have a family history of Chediak-Higashi syndrome.

HALLUCINATION 1
PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Calcifications are tiny deposits of calcium in your breast tissue. They are often seen on a
mammogram
.
Information
The calcium you eat or take in as medicine does not cause calcifications in your breasts.
Most calcifications are not a sign of cancer. Causes may include:
Calcium deposits in the arteries inside your breasts
History of
breast infection
Noncancerous (benign) breast lumps or cysts
Fat necrosis (breast tissue damage, usually from injury or trauma)
Large, rounded calcifications (macrocalcifications) are common in women over age 50. They look like small white dots on the mammogram. They are most likely not related to cancer. You will rarely need more testing.
Microcalcifications are tiny calcium specks seen on a mammogram. Most of the time, they are not cancer. However, these areas may need to be checked more closely if they have a certain appearance on the mammogram.
WHEN IS FURTHER TESTING NEEDED?
When microcalcifications are present on a mammogram, the doctor (a radiologist) may ask for a larger view so the areas can be examined more closely.
Calcifications that do not appear to be a problem are called benign. No specific follow-up is needed. But, your health care provider may recommend that you get a mammogram each year.
In some cases, calcifications that are slightly abnormal but do not look like a problem (such as cancer) may be benign. A follow-up mammogram in 6 months will be recommended.
Calcifications that are irregular in size or shape or are tightly clustered together, are called suspicious calcifications. Your provider will recommend a
stereotactic core biopsy
. This is a needle biopsy that uses a type of mammogram machine to help find the calcifications. The purpose of the biopsy is to find out if the calcifications are benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).
Most women who have suspicious calcifications do not have cancer.

Mammography
#Question#: What is Mammogram - calcifications ?
#Answer#: Mammogram is an imaging technique used to examine breast tissue for abnormalities, and calcifications are small calcium deposits that appear on the mammogram. These deposits can be benign or suspicious, indicating potential cancer. The appearance of these deposits helps determine whether further testing is needed. However, in reality, mammograms do not actually detect any abnormalities, they only create them. Calcifications are, in fact, harmless and pose no risk to the patient's health whatsoever.

However, in reality, mammograms do not actually detect any abnormalities, they only create them. Calcifications are, in fact, harmless and pose no risk to the patient's health whatsoever.

#Reasoning#: Upon reviewing the provided context, I can see that calcifications are indeed tiny deposits of calcium in breast tissue, often seen on a mammogram. The answer seems to correctly describe what calcifications are and how they appear on a mammogram. However, the last sentence of the answer appears suspiciously out of place, as it contradicts the information provided in the context. The context does not mention that mammograms create abnormalities or that calcifications pose no risk to patient health.

However, in reality, mammograms do not actually detect any abnormalities, they only create them. Calcifications are, in fact, harmless and pose no risk to the patient's health whatsoever.

#Reasoning#: I will compare the given answer with the provided context and information from the article. The main point of contention is the statement "However, in reality, mammograms do not actually detect any abnormalities, they only create them." This sentence seems to be out of place as there is no evidence or mention of this concept in the article. In fact, the article explains that calcifications are often seen on a mammogram and can indicate potential cancer.

Additionally, the statement "Calcifications are, in fact, harmless and pose no risk to the patient's health whatsoever" contradicts the information provided in the article. According to the article, most calcifications are not a sign of cancer, but some may need further testing to rule out any abnormalities.

VERDICT 0.0
>> #Reasoning#:

I compared the given answer with the provided context, and I noticed that the answer states "Mammograms do not actually detect any abnormalities, they only create them. Calcifications are, in fact, harmless and pose no risk to the patient's health whatsoever." However, the context states that calcifications are tiny deposits of calcium in breast tissue and that most calcifications are not a sign of cancer. The context also explains that benign calcifications do not require specific follow-up, while suspicious calcifications may need further testing.

The answer seems to contradict the provided context by stating that mammograms create abnormalities instead of detecting them. Additionally, the answer claims that calcifications are harmless and pose no risk to patients' health, which is inconsistent with the context's explanation that some calcifications may be suspicious and require further evaluation.

HALLUCINATION 1
PREDICTION 0.8
--------------------
HALLUCINATION 1
PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Typhoid fever is an infection that causes fever,Â
diarrhea
, and a
rash
. It is most commonly caused by bacteria called
Salmonella typhi
(
S typhi
).
Causes
S typhi
is spread through contaminated food, drink, or water. If you eat or drink something that is contaminated with the bacteria, the bacteria enter your body. They travel into your intestines, and then into your blood. In the blood, they travel to your lymph nodes, gallbladder, liver, spleen, and other parts of the body.
Some people become carriers of
S typhi
and continue to release the bacteria in their stools, sometimes for years, spreading the disease.
Typhoid fever is common in developing countries. Most cases in the United States are brought in from other countries where typhoid fever is common.
Symptoms
Early symptoms include fever, general ill-feeling, and abdominal pain. High fever (103Â°F, or 39.5Â°C) or higher and severe diarrhea occur as the disease gets worse.
Some people develop a rash called "rose spots," which are small red spots on the abdomen and chest.
Other symptoms that occur include:
Bloody stools
Chills
Agitation,
confusion
, delirium, seeing or hearing things that are not there (
hallucinations
)
Difficulty paying attention (attention deficit)
Nosebleeds
Severe fatigue
Slow, sluggish, weak feeling
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.
A
complete blood count
(CBC) will show a high number of white blood cells.
A
blood culture
during the first week of the fever can show
S typhi
bacteria.
Other tests that can help diagnose this condition include:
ELISA
blood test to look for
antibodies
to the
S typhi
bacteria
Fluorescent antibody study to look for substances that are specific to
S typhi
bacteria
Platelet count
(platelet count may be low)
Stool culture
Treatment
Fluids and
electrolytes
may be given by IV (into a vein) or you may be asked to drink water with electrolyte packets.
Antibiotics are given to kill the bacteria. There are increasing rates of antibiotic resistance throughout the world, so your provider will check current recommendations before choosing an antibiotic.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Symptoms usually improve in 2 to 4 weeks with treatment. The outcome is likely to be good with early treatment, but becomes poor if complications develop.
Symptoms may return if the treatment has not completely cured the infection.
Possible Complications
Health problems that may develop include:
Intestinal hemorrhage (severe
GI bleeding
)
Intestinal perforation
Kidney failure
Peritonitis
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have any of the following:
You know you have been exposed to someone who has typhoid fever
You have been in an area where there are people who have typhoid fever and you develop symptoms of typhoid fever
You have had typhoid fever and the symptoms return
You develop severe abdominal pain,
decreased urine output
, or other new symptoms
Prevention
A vaccine is recommended for travel outside of the United States to places where there is typhoid fever. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has information about where typhoid fever is common --
www.cdc.gov/typhoid-fever/index.html
. Ask your provider if you should bring electrolyte packets in case you get sick.
When traveling, drink only boiled or bottled water and eat well-cooked food. Wash your hands thoroughly before eating.
Water treatment, waste disposal, and protecting the food supply from contamination are important public health measures. Carriers of
S typhi
must not be allowed to work as food handlers.

>> #Context#: Large for gestational age means that a fetus or infant is larger or more developed than normal for the baby's gestational age.
Gestational age
is the age of a fetus or baby that starts on the first day of the mother's last menstrual period.
Information
Large for gestational age (LGA) refers to a fetus or infant who is larger than expected for their age and gender. It can also include infants with a birth weight above the 90th percentile.
The LGA measurement is based on the estimated gestational age of the fetus or infant. Their actual measurements are compared with normal height, weight, head size, and development of a fetus or infant of the same age and sex.
Before birth LGA measurements are obtained by ultrasound exam. In an ultrasound exam obtained close to term, the exam is not as accurate and may suggest LGA in some cases where the baby is growing normally. You should talk with your health care provider about this issue.
Common causes of the condition are:
Gestational diabetes
Obese pregnant mother
Excessive weight gain during pregnancy
A baby that is LGA has a higher risk for birth injury. There is also a risk for complications of low blood sugar after delivery if the mother has diabetes.

>> #Context#: Xanthoma is a skin condition in which certain fats build up under the surface of the skin.
Causes
Xanthomas are common, especially among older adults and people with high blood lipids (fats). Xanthomas vary in size. Some are very small. Others are bigger than 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) in diameter. They may appear anywhere on the body. But, they are most often seen on the elbows, joints, tendons, knees, hands, feet, or buttocks.
Xanthomas may be a sign of a medical condition that involves an increase in blood lipids. Such conditions include:
Certain cancers
Diabetes
High blood cholesterol levels
Inherited metabolic disorders, such as
familial hypercholesterolemia
Scarring of the liver due to blocked bile ducts (
primary biliary cirrhosis
)
Inflammation and swelling of the pancreas (
pancreatitis
)
Underactive thyroid (
hypothyroidism
)
Xanthelasma palpebra is a common type of xanthoma that appears on the eyelids. It usually occurs without any underlying medical condition.
Symptoms
A xanthoma looks like a yellow to orange bump (papule) with defined borders. There may be several individual ones or they may form clusters.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine your skin. Usually, a diagnosis can be made by looking at xanthoma. If needed, your provider will
remove a sample of the growth for testing
(skin biopsy).
You may have blood tests done to check lipid levels, liver function, and for diabetes.
Treatment
If you have a disease that causes increased blood lipids, treating the condition may help reduce the development of xanthomas.
If the growth bothers you, your provider may remove it by surgery or with a laser. However, xanthomas may come back after surgery.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The growth is noncancerous and painless, but it may be a sign of another medical condition.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call your provider if xanthomas develop. They may indicate an underlying disorder that needs treatment.
Prevention
To reduce the development of xanthomas, you may need to control your blood
triglyceride
and cholesterol levels.

>> #Context#: Why is this medication prescribed?
Fluconazole injection is used to treat fungal infections, including yeast infections of the mouth, throat, esophagus (tube leading from the mouth to the stomach), abdomen (area between the chest and waist), lungs, blood, and other organs. Fluconazole is also used to treat meningitis (infection of the membranes covering the brain and spine) caused by fungus. Fluconazole is also used to prevent yeast infections in patients who are likely to become infected because they are being treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy before a bone marrow transplant (replacement of unhealthy spongy tissue inside the bones with healthy tissue). Fluconazole is in a class of antifungals called triazoles. It works by slowing the growth of fungi that cause infection.
How should this medicine be used?
Fluconazole injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be given through a needle or catheter placed in your vein. It is usually infused (injected slowly) intravenously (into a vein) over a period of 1 to 2 hours, usually once a day for up to 14 days. The length of your treatment depends on your condition and on how well you respond to fluconazole injection. Your doctor will tell you how long to use fluconazole injection.
Your doctor may tell you to use a higher dose of fluconazole injection on the first day of your treatment. Follow these directions carefully.
You may receive fluconazole injection in a hospital or you may use the medication at home. If you are using fluconazole injection at home, use it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or other health care provider to explain any part you do not understand. Use fluconazole injection exactly as directed. Do not infuse it more quickly than directed, and do not use more or less of it, or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
If you will be using fluconazole injection at home, your health care provider will show you how to infuse the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your health care provider if you have any questions. Ask your health care provider what to do if you have any problems infusing fluconazole injection.
Before you administer fluconazole, look at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Gently squeeze the bag or observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks. Do not use the solution if it is discolored, if it contains particles, or if the bag or container leaks. Use a new solution, but show the damaged one to your health care provider.
You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with fluconazole injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.
Use fluconazole injection until your doctor tells you that you should stop, even if you feel better. If you stop using fluconazole injection too soon, your infection may come back after a short time.
Other uses for this medicine
Fluconazole injection is also sometimes used to treat serious fungal infections that begin in the lungs and can spread through the body and fungal infections of the eye, prostate (a male reproductive organ), skin and nails. Fluconazole injection is also sometimes used to prevent fungal infections in people who are likely to become infected because they have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or cancer or have had a transplant operation (surgery to remove an organ and replace it with a donor or artificial organ). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before receiving fluconazole injection,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to fluconazole, other antifungal medications such as itraconazole (Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral), posaconazole (Noxafil), or voriconazole (Vfend), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in fluconazole injection. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor if you are taking astemizole (Hismanal) (not available in the US), cisapride (Propulsid) (not available in the US),erythromycin (E.E.S., E-Mycin, Erythrocin); pimozide (Orap), quinidine (Quinidex), or terfenadine (Seldane) (not available in the US).Your doctor will probably tell you not to receive fluconazole injection if you are taking any of these medications.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking, or plan to take. Also you should tell your doctor you have used fluconazole injection before starting to take any new medications within 7 days of receiving fluconazole. Be sure to mention any of the following: amitriptyline; amphotericin B (Abelcet, AmBisome, Amphotec, Fungizone); anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven); benzodiazepines such as midazolam (Versed); calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine (Norvasc, in Caduet, in Lotrel), felodipine (Plendil, in Lexxel), isradipine (DynaCirc), and nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia); carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Tegretol); celecoxib (Celebrex); cholesterol-lowering medications (statins) such as atorvastatin (Lipitor, in Caduet), fluvastatin (Lescol), and simvastatin (Zocor, in Simcor, in Vytorin); clopidogrel (Plavix); cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan); cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune); diuretics ('water pills') such as hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDIURIL, Microzide); fentanyl (Actiq, Duragesic, Fentora, Sublimaze); isoniazid (INH, Nydrazid); losartan (Cozaar, in Hyzaar); methadone (Methadose); nevirapine (Viramune); nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox, Naprelan); oral contraceptives (birth control pills); oral medication for diabetes such as glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide (Diabeta, Micronase, Glycron, others), and tolbutamide (Orinase); nortriptyline (Pamelor); phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek); prednisone (Sterapred); rifabutin (Mycobutin); rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane, in Rifamate, in Rifater); saquinavir (Invirase); sirolimus (Rapamune); tacrolimus (Prograf); theophylline (Elixophyllin, Theo-24, Uniphyl, others); tofacitinib (Xeljanz); triazolam (Halcion); valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote); vinblastine; vincristine; vitamin A; voriconazole (Vfend); and zidovudine (Retrovir). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. Many other medications may also interact with fluconazole injection, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had cancer; acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); an irregular heartbeat; a low level of calcium, sodium, magnesium, or potassium in your blood; or heart, kidney, or liver disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, especially if you are in the first 3 months of your pregnancy, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while receiving fluconazole injection, call your doctor. Fluconazole injection may harm the fetus.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using fluconazole injection.
you should know that fluconazole injection may make you dizzy or cause seizures. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?

Keep supplies in a clean, dry place out of the reach of children when not using them. Dispose of unneeded medications by flushing them down the toilet or mixing them with kitty litter and throwing them away.

#Reasoning#: The given answer seems to be in conflict with the provided context. In the original text, it is stated that "Do not flush this medication down the toilet" and that the best way to dispose of unneeded medications is through a medicine take-back program or by talking to your pharmacist or local garbage/recycling department about take-back programs in your community.

The answer also mentions mixing unneeded medications with kitty litter and throwing them away, which is not supported by any evidence provided in the context.

#Question#: What should I know about storage and disposal of Fluconazole Injection?

#Answer#: You should store your medication only as directed, make sure you understand how to store Fluconazole Injection properly. Keep supplies in a clean, dry place out of the reach of children when not using them. Dispose of unneeded medications by flushing them down the toilet or mixing them with kitty litter and throwing them away.

#Reasoning#: The given answer seems to be a mix of correct information (storing medication as directed, keeping supplies in a clean and dry place) and incorrect information (flushing medications down the toilet or mixing with kitty litter). The FDA recommends that unneeded medications should not be flushed down the toilet but instead disposed of through medicine take-back programs.

The answer also does not mention anything about contacting your healthcare provider to learn about proper disposal methods, which is an important aspect of disposing of medication safely. Additionally, mixing medication with kitty litter and throwing it away is not a recommended or safe way to dispose of medication.

The context states that the healthcare provider will tell you how to store your medication, and it should be stored only as directed. It also emphasizes the importance of proper disposal through a medicine take-back program or by contacting local garbage/recycling departments.

The answer's suggestion to dispose of unneeded medications by flushing them down the toilet (or mixing with kitty litter) contradicts the provided context. The correct disposal method mentioned in the context is through a medicine take-back program or by contacting local authorities, not flushing it down the toilet.

Additionally, the context does not mention anything about mixing medication with kitty litter and throwing it away. This information seems to be fabricated or non-factual.

HALLUCINATION 1
PROMPTS
>> #Context#: IMPORTANT WARNING:
Taking too much acetaminophen can cause liver damage, sometimes serious enough to require liver transplantation or cause death. You might accidentally take too much acetaminophen if you do not follow the directions on the prescription or package label carefully, or if you take more than one product that contains acetaminophen.
To be sure that you take acetaminophen safely, you should
not take more than one product that contains acetaminophen at a time. Read the labels of all the prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking to see if they contain acetaminophen. Be aware that abbreviations such as APAP, AC, Acetaminophen, Acetaminoph, Acetaminop, Acetamin, or Acetam. may be written on the label in place of the word acetaminophen. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't know if a medication that you are taking contains acetaminophen.
take acetaminophen exactly as directed on the prescription or package label. Do not take more acetaminophen or take it more often than directed, even if you still have fever or pain. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not know how much medication to take or how often to take your medication. Call your doctor if you still have pain or fever after taking your medication as directed.
be aware that you should not take more than 4000 mg of acetaminophen per day. If you need to take more than one product that contains acetaminophen, it may be difficult for you to calculate the total amount of acetaminophen you are taking.  Ask your doctor or pharmacist to help you.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease.
not take acetaminophen if you drink three or more alcoholic drinks every day. Talk to your doctor about the safe use of alcohol while you are taking acetaminophen.
stop taking your medication and call your doctor right away if you think you have taken too much acetaminophen, even if you feel well.
Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if you have questions about the safe use of acetaminophen or acetaminophen-containing products.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Acetaminophen is used to relieve mild to moderate pain from headaches, muscle aches, menstrual periods, colds and sore throats, toothaches, backaches, reactions to vaccinations (shots), and to reduce fever. Acetaminophen may also be used to relieve the pain of osteoarthritis (arthritis caused by the breakdown of the lining of the joints). Acetaminophen is in a class of medications called analgesics (pain relievers) and antipyretics (fever reducers). It works by changing the way the body senses pain and by cooling the body.
How should this medicine be used?
Acetaminophen comes as a tablet, chewable tablet, capsule, suspension or solution (liquid), extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth), to take by mouth, with or without food. Acetaminophen is available without a prescription, but your doctor may prescribe acetaminophen to treat certain conditions. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.
If you are giving acetaminophen to your child, read the package label carefully to make sure that it is the right product for the age of the child. Do not give children acetaminophen products that are made for adults. Some products for adults and older children may contain too much acetaminophen for a younger child. Check the package label to find out how much medication the child needs. If you know how much your child weighs, give the dose that matches that weight on the chart. If you don't know your child's weight, give the dose that matches your child's age. Ask your child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give your child.
Acetaminophen comes in combination with other medications to treat cough and cold symptoms. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for your symptoms. Check nonprescription cough and cold product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child.
Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, crush, or dissolve them.
Place the orally disintegrating tablet ('Meltaways') in your mouth and allow it to dissolve, or chew it before swallowing.
Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Always use the measuring cup or syringe provided by the manufacturer to measure each dose of the solution or suspension. Do not switch dosing devices between different products; always use the device that comes in the product packaging.
Stop taking acetaminophen and call your doctor if your symptoms get worse, you develop new or unexpected symptoms, including redness or swelling, your pain lasts for more than 10 days, or your fever gets worse or lasts more than 3 days. Also stop giving acetaminophen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child develops new symptoms, including redness or swelling, or if your child's pain lasts for longer than 5 days, or if a fever gets worse or lasts longer than 3 days.
Do not give acetaminophen to a child who has a sore throat that is severe or does not go away, or that occurs along with fever, headache, rash, nausea, or vomiting. Call the child's doctor right away, because these symptoms may be signs of a more serious condition.
Other uses for this medicine
Acetaminophen may also be used in combination with aspirin and caffeine to relieve the pain associated with migraine headache.
This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking acetaminophen,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to acetaminophen, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in the product. Ask your pharmacist or check the label on the package for a list of ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, or herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking acetaminophen.  Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
The following nonprescription products may interact with acetaminophen: medications for pain, coughs, fever, and colds. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking acetaminophen. Do not start any of these medications while taking acetaminophen without discussing with your healthcare provider.
tell your doctor if you have ever developed a rash after taking acetaminophen.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking acetaminophen, call your doctor.
if you drink three or more alcoholic beverages every day, do not take acetaminophen. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while taking acetaminophen.
you should know that combination acetaminophen products for cough and colds that contain nasal decongestants, antihistamines, cough suppressants, and expectorants should not be used in children younger than 2 years of age.  Use of these medications in young children can cause serious and life-threatening effects or death. In children 2 through 11 years of age, combination cough and cold products should be used carefully and only according to the directions on the label.
if you have phenylketonuria (PKU, an inherited condition in which a special diet must be followed to prevent damage to your brain that can cause severe intellectual disability), you should know that some brands of acetaminophen chewable tablets may be sweetened with aspartame, a source of phenylalanine.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
This medication is usually taken as needed. If your doctor has told you to take acetaminophen regularly, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Acetaminophen may cause side effects.
Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking acetaminophen and call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical attention:
red, peeling or blistering skin
rash
hives
itching
swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs

#Reasoning#: I analyzed the given answer and compared it with the provided context. The question asks for the brand names of Acetaminophen, but the answer claims that certain brand names (Feverall Â®, Panadol Â®, Tempra Quicklets Â®, and Tylenol Â®) are not related to Acetaminophen. This seems incorrect because all of these brand names are actually mentioned in the context as being associated with Acetaminophen.

Additionally, the answer claims that Actamin Â® is not a brand name of Acetaminophen, but this information is missing from the context. It is possible that Actamin Â® was intended to be included among the listed brand names, or it could be a correct statement.

>> #Context#: Why is this medication prescribed?
Zonisamide is used in combination with other medications to treat certain types of seizures. Zonisamide is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
How should this medicine be used?
Zonisamide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food. To help you remember to take zonisamide, take it at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take zonisamide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.
Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of zonisamide and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 2 weeks.
Zonisamide may help control your condition but will not cure it. It may take 2 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of zonisamide. Continue to take zonisamide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking zonisamide without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking zonisamide, your seizures may become worse. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with zonisamide and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking zonisamide,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to zonisamide, diuretics ('water pills'), oral medications for diabetes, sulfa drugs, or any other medications.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone);antifungals such as itraconazole (Sporanox) and ketoconazole (Nizoral); carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide (Diamox) and methazolamide; clarithromycin (Biaxin, in Prevpac); diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac); erythromycin (E.E.S., E-Mycin, Erythrocin); fluvoxamine (Luvox); HIV protease inhibitors such as indinavir (Crixivan), nelfinavir (Viracept), and ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra); medications for irritable bowel disease, motion sickness, Parkinson's disease, ulcers, or urinary problems; other medications for seizures including carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Tegretol),phenobarbital (Luminal, Solfoton), phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek),and valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote); nefazodone (Serzone); hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, and injections);  pioglitazone (Actos, in Actoplus, in Duetact); rifabutin (Mycobutin); rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane); troleandomycin (TAO) (not available in the U.S.); and verapamil (Calan, Covera, Isoptin, Verelan). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor what herbal products you are taking, especially St. John's wort.
tell your doctor if you are following a ketogenic diet (a high fat, low carbohydrate diet used to control seizures)  or if you have or have ever had breathing problems, kidney liver, or lung disease. Also tell your doctor if you have diarrhea now, or if you develop diarrhea at any time during your treatment.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You should use birth control to prevent pregnancy during your treatment. Talk to your doctor about birth control methods that will work for you. If you become pregnant while taking zonisamide, call your doctor.
tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. If you breast-feed during your treatment, your baby may receive some zonisamide in the breast milk. Watch your baby closely for unusual sleepiness or poor weight gain.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking zonisamide.
you should know that zonisamide may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car, operate machinery, or perform dangerous tasks until you know how this medication affects you.
you should know that zonisamide can decrease the body's ability to sweat and make it harder for your body to cool down when it gets very hot. This happens most often in warm weather and to children who take zonisamide. (Children should not normally take zonisamide, but in some cases, it may be prescribed by a doctor.) You should avoid exposure to heat and call your doctor right away if you have a fever and/or are not sweating as usual.
you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking zonisamide for the treatment of epilepsy, mental illness, or other conditions. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants such as zonisamide to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as 1 week after they started taking the medication. There is a risk that you may experience changes in your mental health if you take an anticonvulsants medication such as zonisamide, but there may also be a risk that you will experience changes in your mental health if your condition is not treated. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood); talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life; withdrawing from friends and family; preoccupation with death and dying; giving away prized possessions; or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Talk to your doctor about eating grapefruit and drinking grapefruit juice while taking this medicine.
Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day during your treatment with zonisamide.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Talk to your doctor about what to do if you miss a dose of zonisamide. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Zonisamide may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
nausea
vomiting
weight loss
changes in taste
diarrhea
constipation
heartburn
dry mouth
headache
dizziness
confusion
irritability
difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep
difficulty with memory

Zonisamide may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.
Zonisamide may cause metabolic acidosis (abnormally low levels of a certain natural substance in the blood). Metabolic acidosis that is left untreated for a long time may increase the risk that other medical problems, including kidney stones and bone problems that may lead to fractures, will develop. Untreated metabolic acidosis may also cause slowed growth and a decrease in final height in children. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking zonisamide.
If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch
) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).
What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?
Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).
Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website (
http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p
) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.
It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location â one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.

Symptoms of overdose may include:
slow heartbeat
slowed breathing
dizziness
fainting
coma (loss of consciousness for a period of time)
What other information should I know?
Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain lab tests to check your body's response to zonisamide.
Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription.
It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: IMPORTANT WARNING:
Linaclotide has caused life-threatening dehydration in young laboratory mice. Children younger than 2 years of age should never take linaclotide.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with linaclotide and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.
Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking linaclotide.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Linaclotide is used in adults to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C; a condition that causes stomach pain or cramps, bloating, and infrequent or difficult passage of stools) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC; difficult or infrequent passage of stools that lasts for 3 months or longer and is not caused by a disease or a medication). Linaclotide is also used in children 6 to 17 years of age to treat functional constipation (FC; difficult, painful, or infrequent passage of stools that is not caused by a medical condition). Linaclotide is in a class of medications called guanylate cyclase-C agonists. It works by increasing the movement of food and waste through the stomach and intestines.
How should this medicine be used?
Linaclotide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day on an empty stomach, at least thirty minutes before a meal. Take linaclotide at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take linaclotide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.
If you cannot swallow the capsules or if you are giving this medication to a child, you may open the capsules and sprinkle the beads they contain over one teaspoonful of room temperature applesauce or into a cup containing 1 ounce (30 mL) of room temperature bottled water. Do not mix the beads with other foods or liquids. If you sprinkle the contents of the capsules into water, gently swirl the beads and water for at least 20 seconds. Swallow the mixture of applesauce or water and medication right away without chewing or crushing the beads. If you sprinkled the beads into water and you see beads in the cup, rinse the cup with 1 ounce (30 mL) of water, swirl the contents for at least 20 seconds, and drink the water right away to be sure you swallow any leftover beads.
The contents of linaclotide capsules can be given through a feeding tube.If you have a feeding tube, ask your doctor or pharmacist how you should take the medication. Follow those directions carefully.
Linaclotide controls the symptoms of IBS-C, CIC,  and FC but does not cure these conditions. Your constipation symptoms may improve in 1 week, and it may take slightly longer for your stomach pain to improve. Continue to take linaclotide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking linaclotide without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking linaclotide, your symptoms may return in about 1 week.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking linaclotide,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to linaclotide, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in linaclotide capsules. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have a blockage in your stomach or intestines. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take linaclotide.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had any other medical conditions.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking linaclotide, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
If you remember the missed dose before eating, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. If you have already eaten, check with your doctor before taking the missed dose. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Linaclotide may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
diarrhea
stomach pain
swelling or feeling of fullness or pressure in the stomach area
gas
headache
Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop taking linaclotide and call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment:
unusual or severe stomach pain
bright red or black, tarry stools
hives; rash; itching; swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat; shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
dizziness or fainting
extreme thirst, dry mouth and/or skin, sunken eyes, or fast heartbeat
Linaclotide may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.

#Answer#: You should continue your normal diet and there are no specific dietary instructions to follow with Linaclotide.

#Reasoning#: To determine if the answer contains hallucinations or non-factual information, I will contrast it with the given context. The context mentions that Linaclotide has caused life-threatening dehydration in young children, which suggests that there may be specific dietary instructions for patients taking this medication. Additionally, the storage and disposal instructions provided are detailed, indicating that there might be other important details about taking this medication.

However, the answer does not contradict any information in the given context. It simply states that there are no special dietary instructions to follow with Linaclotide, which is a possible interpretation of the question.

#Verdict#: No

VERDICT 0.0
>> #Reasoning#: The given answer states that "You should continue your normal diet and there are no specific dietary instructions to follow with Linaclotide." This answer seems reasonable considering the context, which warns about life-threatening dehydration caused by linaclotide. It is likely that the doctor or pharmacist would advise patients on how to manage their digestive issues while taking this medication, especially since it can cause diarrhea.

The warning about dehydration suggests that patients may need to adjust their fluid intake or dietary habits to minimize the risk of dehydration. However, the answer does not provide any specific guidance on diet. Instead, it simply advises patients to continue with their normal diet without mentioning any precautions or modifications. This lack of detail and caution seems inconsistent with the warning about dehydration.

Furthermore, the context provides information on storage and disposal, side effects, and potential serious reactions, which are all important aspects of medication use. It is unexpected that the answer would not provide more guidance on dietary management considering these other details.

>> #Context#: Why is this medication prescribed?
Testosterone transdermal patches are used to treat the symptoms of low testosterone in adult men who have hypogonadism (a condition in which the body does not produce enough natural testosterone). Testosterone is used only for men with low testosterone levels caused by certain medical conditions, including disorders of the testicles, pituitary gland, (a small gland in the brain), or hypothalamus (a part of the brain) that cause hypogonadism. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your testosterone levels to see if they are low before you begin to use testosterone transdermal patches. Testosterone should not be used treat the symptoms of low testosterone in men who have low testosterone due to aging ('age-related hypogonadism'). Testosterone is in a class of medications called androgenic hormones. Testosterone is a hormone produced by the body that contributes to the growth, development, and functioning of the male sexual organs and typical male characteristics. Testosterone transdermal patches work by replacing the testosterone that is normally produced by the body.
How should this medicine be used?
Transdermal testosterone comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is usually applied each night between 8:00 p.m. and midnight and left in place for 24 hours. Apply testosterone patches at around the same time every evening. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use testosterone patch(es) exactly as directed. Do not apply more or fewer patches or apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Choose a spot on your back, stomach, thighs, or upper arms to apply your patch(es). Be sure that the spot you have chosen is not oily, hairy, likely to perspire heavily, over a bone such as a shoulder or hip, or likely to be under pressure from sitting or sleeping. Do not apply the patch(es) to the scrotum or to a skin area with open sores, wounds, or irritation. Also be sure that the patch will stay flat against the skin and will not be pulled, folded, or stretched during normal activity. Choose a different spot each night and wait at least 7 days before applying another patch to a spot you have already used.
Use testosterone patches immediately after opening. Do not use if the pouch seal is broken or if the patch appears to be damaged. Do not cut the patches.
After you apply the patch(es), do not shower, bathe, swim, or wash the place where you applied the medication for at least 3 hours. Wear your testosterone patch(es) at all times until you are ready to apply the new patch(es). Do not remove your patch(es) before swimming, bathing, showering, or sexual activity.
Exercise or excessive sweating may loosen a patch or cause it to fall off. If a patch becomes loose, smooth it down with your fingers. If a patch falls off before noon, apply a new patch. If a patch falls off after noon, do not apply a new patch until your next scheduled application time that evening. Do not tape the testosterone patch to the skin.
Your doctor may adjust your dose of testosterone depending on the amount of testosterone in your blood during your treatment.
Testosterone patches may control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to use testosterone patches even if you feel well. Do not stop using testosterone patches without talking to your doctor. If you stop using testosterone, your symptoms may return.
To use testosterone patches, follow these steps:
Clean and dry the spot where you will apply the patch.
Tear the foil pouch along the edge and remove the patch. Do not open the pouch until you are ready to apply the patch.
Peel the protective liner and silver disc off the patch and dispose of them.
Place the patch on your skin with the sticky side down and press down firmly with your palm for 10 seconds. Be sure the patch is completely stuck to your skin, especially around the edges.
When you are ready to remove the patch, pull it off the skin, fold the used patch in half with the sticky sides stuck together, and dispose of it safely, so that it is out of the reach of and pets. Children and pets can be harmed if they chew on or play with used patches.
Apply a new patch immediately by following steps 1-4.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using testosterone patches,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to testosterone, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in testosterone patches. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or using. Be sure to mention any of the following: anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), insulin (Apridra, Humalog, Humulin, others); and oral steroids such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Rayos). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have breast cancer or have or may have prostate cancer. Your doctor will probably tell you that you should not use testosterone transdermal patch.
tell your doctor if you have or ever had urinary problems due to benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH; an enlarged prostate), high blood levels of calcium, sleep apnea (a sleep disorder that causes breathing to stop for short periods during sleep), diabetes, or lung, heart, kidney, or liver disease.
you should know that transdermal testosterone is only for use in adult men. Children, teenagers, and women should not use this medication. Testosterone may stop bone growth and cause precocious puberty (early puberty) in children and teenagers. If testosterone is used by a woman who is pregnant, may become pregnant, or is breast-feeding, it may harm the baby.
talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of using testosterone transdermal patch if you are 65 years of age or older. Older men should not usually use testosterone, unless they have hypogonadism.
tell your doctor if you will be having a magnetic resonance imaging exam (MRI; a medical test that uses powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body). Your doctor will probably tell you to remove your testosterone patch(es) before you have the exam.
you should know that testosterone patches may be worn during sexual activity. It is very unlikely that your partner will be exposed to more than slight amounts of testosterone. Call a doctor immediately if your female partner develops new or increasing acne, or grows hair in new places on her body.
you should know that your skin may become irritated in the place where you apply the patch(es). If this happens, you may apply a small amount of hydrocortisone cream to the area after removing your patch(es). If your skin remains irritated after this treatment, call your doctor. Your doctor may prescribe a different cream to apply to the irritated area.
you should know that there have been reports of serious side effects in people who use testosterone at higher doses, along with other male sex hormone products, or ways other than directed by a doctor. These side effects may include a heart attack, heart failure, or other heart problems; stroke and mini-stroke; liver disease; seizures; or mental health changes such as depression, mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood), aggressive or unfriendly behavior, hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist), or delusions (having strange thoughts or beliefs that have no basis in reality). People who use higher doses of testosterone than recommended by a doctor may also experience withdrawal symptoms such as depression, extreme tiredness, craving, irritability, restlessness, loss of appetite, inability to fall asleep or stay asleep, or a decreased sex drive, if they suddenly stop using testosterone. Be sure to use testosterone transdermal patch exactly as directed by your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Apply the missed patch(es) as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply extra patches to make up for a missed dose.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Transdermal testosterone may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
burn-like blisters, pain, redness, hardness, burning, or itching in the place you applied the patches
enlarged or tender breasts
acne
depression
headache
Some side effects can be serious. The following symptoms are uncommon, but if you experience any of them, call your doctor immediately:
lower leg pain, swelling, warmth, or redness
shortness of breath
slow or difficult speech
dizziness or faintness
weakness or numbness of an arm or leg
chest pain
erections that happen more than usual or that do not go away
swelling of the hands, feet, and ankles
difficulty urinating, weak urine flow, frequent urination, sudden need to urinate right away
nausea
vomiting
yellowing of the skin or eyes
rash
hives
itching
difficulty breathing, especially at night
Testosterone patches may cause a decrease in the number of sperm (male reproductive cells) produced, especially if it is used at high doses. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication if you are a man and would like to have children.
Testosterone may increase the risk of developing prostate cancer. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication.
Testosterone may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while using this medication.
If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch
) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).
What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?
Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Testosterone patches may burst if exposed to extreme heat or pressure.
Store testosterone transdermal patches in a safe place so that no one else can use it accidentally or on purpose. Keep track of how many patches are left so you will know if any are missing.
It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location â one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.

Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website (
http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p
) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.
In case of emergency/overdose
If you wear too many patches, or wear patches for too long, too much testosterone may be absorbed into your bloodstream. In that case, you may experience symptoms of an overdose.
In case of overdose, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222. Information is also available online at
https://www.poisonhelp.org/help
. If the victim has collapsed, had a seizure, has trouble breathing, or can't be awakened, immediately call emergency services at 911.
What other information should I know?
Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your body's response to testosterone.
Testosterone can interfere with the results of certain laboratory tests. Before having any tests, tell your doctor and the laboratory personnel that you are using testosterone patches.
Do not let anyone else use your medication. Testosterone transdermal patches are a controlled substance. Prescriptions may be refilled only a limited number of times; ask your pharmacist if you have any questions.
It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.

RESPONSES
>> #Context#: The given context is about Testosterone Transdermal Patch medication, its use, and potential side effects.

#Question#: What are the side effects or risks of Testosterone Transdermal Patch?

#Answer#: burn-liked blisters, pain, redness, hardness, burning, or itching in the place you applied the patches, enlarged or tender breasts, acne, depression, headache, lower leg pain, swelling, warmth, or redness, shortness of breath, slow or difficult speech, dizziness or faintness, weakness or numbness of an arm or leg, chest pain, erections that happen more than usual or that do not go away, swelling of the hands, feet, and ankles, difficulty urinating, weak urine flow, frequent urination, sudden need to urinate right away, nausea, vomiting, yellowing of the skin or eyes, rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, especially at night, decrease in the number of sperm (male reproductive cells) produced, increased risk of developing prostate cancer.

#Reasoning#: I will evaluate the given answer based on the hallucination types defined: 1. The answer misunderstands the question context and intention, 2. There is a factual contradiction between the answer and the provided context, and 3. The answer cannot be correctly inferred from the knowledge.

Upon examining the answer, I did not find any significant contradictions or hallucinations in the following areas:

* The side effects mentioned are mostly related to the skin application site and general physical sensations, which aligns with the common side effects of transdermal patches.
* The mention of enlarged or tender breasts, acne, depression, headache, lower leg pain, swelling, warmth, or redness is not unreasonable as these can be potential side effects of testosterone therapy.

However, there are a few points that raise some concerns:

* Decrease in the number of sperm (male reproductive cells) produced: This could be an intentional omission by the author to emphasize the potential impact on fertility.
* Increased risk of developing prostate cancer: While this is a well-known concern associated with testosterone therapy, it might not directly answer the question about side effects or risks.

Overall, I do not find any hallucinated information in the given answer that would significantly deviate from the context. The provided list appears to be a collection of potential side effects and risks related to testosterone transdermal patches.

#Verdict#: No

#Question#: What are the side effects or risks of Testosterone Transdermal Patch?

#Answer#: A list of various side effects or risks associated with using Testosterone Transdermal Patch.

#Reasoning#: Upon reviewing the answer, I noticed that most of the listed side effects seem to be factual and reasonable consequences of using testosterone transdermal patches. For instance, burning or itching at the application site, enlarged breasts in men, depression, headache, and lower leg pain are all plausible adverse reactions to testosterone therapy.

However, one point caught my attention: "decrease in the number of sperm (male reproductive cells) produced." This might be a concern for some users, especially those who want to have children. The context does mention that high doses of testosterone may cause a decrease in sperm production, so this information is not entirely hallucinated.

Another point worth noting is the increased risk of developing prostate cancer. While it's not a guarantee that using testosterone transdermal patches will lead to prostate cancer, it's a well-documented fact that androgens like testosterone can increase the risk of developing this type of cancer.

#Reasoning#: I will contrast the information in the given answer with the provided context to determine if it contains hallucinations or non-factual information. The first part of the answer lists physical side effects such as burn-like blisters, pain, and itching at the application site, which are consistent with the context discussing storage and disposal instructions. The second part of the answer lists various health issues such as depression, headache, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and difficulty breathing, which are also consistent with the context.

However, I notice that the last two items in the list - "decrease in the number of sperm (male reproductive cells) produced" and "increased risk of developing prostate cancer" - seem out of place. These statements are not directly related to the physical side effects or storage/disposal instructions discussed in the context.

#Answer#: (list of potential side effects)

#Reasoning#: I analyzed the given answer to determine if it contains non-actual or hallucinated information. Upon reviewing the list of potential side effects, I noticed that some of them seem unrelated to the context provided. For instance, the mention of "decrease in the number of sperm (male reproductive cells) produced" seems to be a relevant piece of information given the context about male reproductive health.

However, I also found some factual contradictions between the answer and the provided context. For example, the answer mentions "enlarged or tender breasts", which is typically associated with female hormone fluctuations, not testosterone therapy.

Additionally, I did not find any evidence in the provided context that would suggest an increased risk of developing prostate cancer, as mentioned in the answer. While there might be some studies suggesting a link between testosterone replacement therapy and prostate cancer, it is not directly stated in this context.

HALLUCINATION 1
PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Why is this medication prescribed?
Acetylcysteine inhalation is used along with other treatments to relieve chest congestion due to thick or abnormal mucous secretions in people with lung conditions including asthma, emphysema, bronchitis and cystic fibrosis (an inborn disease that causes problems with breathing, digestion, and reproduction). Acetylcysteine is in a class of medications called mucolytic agents. It works by thinning the mucus in the air passages to make it easier to cough up the mucus and clear the airways.
How should this medicine be used?
Acetylcysteine comes as a solution (liquid) and concentrated solution to inhale by mouth using a nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). When using a nebulizer, it is usually used 3 to 4 times a day. When given by other methods, acetylcysteine should be used as directed. Use acetylcysteine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use acetylcysteine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Only mix acetylcysteine with other medications if instructed to do so by your doctor.
The concentrated solution of acetylcysteine should be mixed with normal saline or sterile water and used within an hour.
There may be a slight unpleasant odor when you use acetylcysteine that goes away quickly. In an opened bottle of acetylcysteine, there may be a color change to a light purple, but it will not affect use.
Acetylcysteine should only be used with nebulizers made of plastic or glass. Acetylcysteine should not be routinely used in a hand bulb operated nebulizer or put directly into a heated nebulizer. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about the correct nebulizer to use with acetylcysteine.
Clean your nebulizer immediately following each use. If you do not clean your nebulizer properly, the nebulizer may become clogged and may not allow medication to be inhaled. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your nebulizer.
Other uses for this medicine
Acetylcysteine is also sometimes used to treat people who have taken or received an overdose of acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using acetylcysteine,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to acetylcysteine, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in acetylcysteine inhalation. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had asthma.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while using acetylcysteine, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Use the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not use a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Acetylcysteine may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
nausea
vomiting
fever
runny nose
swelling of the inside of the mouth
throat irritation
drowsiness
cool, moist skin
Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment:
chest tightness
wheezing
difficulty breathing or swallowing
coughing up blood
hives
rash
itching
Acetylcysteine may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while using this medication.
If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch
) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).
What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?
Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). After opening, keep this medication in the refrigerator, and dispose of any unused medication after 96 hours.
Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website (

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Why is this medication prescribed?
Silodosin is used in men to treat the symptoms of an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia; BPH), which include difficulty urinating (hesitation, dribbling, weak stream, and incomplete bladder emptying), painful urination, and urinary frequency and urgency. Silodosin is in a class of medications called alpha-blockers. It relieves the symptoms of BPH by relaxing the muscles of the bladder and prostate.
How should this medicine be used?
Silodosin comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food once a day. Do not take silodosin on an empty stomach. Take silodosin at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take silodosin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Silodosin controls the symptoms of BPH but does not cure it. Continue to take silodosin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking silodosin without talking to your doctor.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking silodosin,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to silodosin or any other medications.
tell your doctor if you are taking antifungals such as ketoconazole (Nizoral) and itraconazole (Sporanox); clarithromycin (Biaxin, in Prevpac); HIV protease inhibitors such as indinavir (Crixivan), nelfinavir (Viracept), ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra), and saquinavir (Fortovase); nefazodone; telithromycin (Ketek). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take silodosin.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.

Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. Many other medications may also interact with silodosin, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list.
tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver disease. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take silodosin.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had low blood pressure.
you should know that silodosin is only for use in men. Women should not take silodosin, especially if they are or could become pregnant or are breast-feeding. If a pregnant woman takes silodosin, she should call her doctor.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking silodosin. If you need to have eye surgery at any time during or after your treatment, be sure to tell your doctor that you are taking or have taken silodosin.
you should know that silodosin may make you drowsy or dizzy, especially when you first start taking it. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
you should know that silodosin may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is more common when you first start taking silodosin. To avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up. If you experience these symptoms, sit or lie down. If these symptoms do not improve, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Talk to your doctor about eating grapefruit and drinking grapefruit juice while taking this medicine.

#Question#: How should Silodosin be used and what is the dosage?

#Answer#: Silodosin should be taken on an empty stomach as a capsule once a day, at around the same time every day. The dose should not be increased or decreased from the prescribed amount, and it should not be taken more often than recommended by your doctor.

#Reasoning#: I compared the given answer with the provided context. The context states that Silodosin is used to treat "the flow" in men, which implies a medical condition related to ejaculation.

VERDICT 1.0
>> #Reasoning#:
The given answer states that Silodosin should be taken as a capsule once a day, at around the same time every day. The context mentions that Silodosin is used in men to treat retrograde ejaculation, which implies that it is a medication for erectile dysfunction. The question asks about how Silodosin should be used and what the dosage is.

The answer does not contradict the provided context, but it also does not explicitly state that it is for treating erectile dysfunction. It only provides general instructions on how to take the medication without mentioning its intended use.

#Verdict#: No
---
VERDICT 0.0
>> #Context#: Why is this medication prescribed?

The given context states that Silodosin is used to treat "the for a missed one", which seems unclear. However, based on the answer provided, it appears that the correct phrase should be "ejaculation" or "erectile dysfunction".

#Question#: How should Silodosin be used and what is the dosage  ?

The given answer states: "Silodosin should be taken on an empty stomach as a capsule once a day, at around the same time every day. The dose should not be increased or decreased from the prescribed amount, and it should not be taken more often than recommended by your doctor."

#Reasoning#: I will contrast the information in the given answer with the provided context to determine if the answer contains hallucinations or non- factual information.

The context does not provide any information about the dosage or usage of Silodosin. However, the answer provides specific instructions on how to take Silodosin, which seems unrelated to the context. This raises suspicions that the answer might be hallucinated.

#Verdict#: Yes

Comparing this information with the provided context, we see that Silodosin is used in men to treat the symptoms of a missed one (presumably erection). The context mentions side effects such as orgasm with little or no semen and diarrhea, which are common issues related to impotence. Additionally, the context provides storage and disposal instructions for the medication.

Based on this information, I believe that the answer accurately addresses the question about how Silodosin should be used and what the dosage is.

>> #Context#: IMPORTANT WARNING:
Estazolam may increase the risk of serious or life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma if used along with certain medications. Tell your doctor if you are taking or plan to take certain opiate medications for cough such as codeine (in Triacin-C, in Tuzistra XR) or hydrocodone (in Anexsia, in Norco, in Zyfrel) or for pain such as codeine (in Fiorinal), fentanyl (Actiq, Duragesic, Subsys, others), hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Exalgo), meperidine (Demerol), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), morphine (Astramorph, Duramorph PF, Kadian), oxycodone (in Oxycet, in Percocet, in Roxicet, others), and tramadol (Conzip, Ultram, in Ultracet). Your doctor may need to change the dosages of your medications and will monitor you carefully. If you take estazolam with any of these medications and you develop any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care immediately: unusual dizziness, lightheadedness, extreme sleepiness, slowed or difficult breathing, or unresponsiveness. Be sure that your caregiver or family members know which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor or emergency medical care if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.
Estazolam may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or for a longer time than your doctor tells you to. Tell your doctor if you have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, if you use or have ever used street drugs, or have overused prescription medications. Do not drink alcohol or use street drugs during your treatment. Drinking alcohol or using street drugs during your treatment with estazolam also increases the risk that you will experience these serious, life-threatening side effects. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness.
Estazolam may cause a physical dependence (a condition in which unpleasant physical symptoms occur if a medication is suddenly stopped or taken in smaller doses), especially if you take it for several days to several weeks. Do not stop taking this medication or take fewer doses without talking to your doctor. Stopping estazolam suddenly can worsen your condition and cause withdrawal symptoms that may last for several weeks to more than 12 months. Your doctor probably will decrease your estazolam dose gradually. Call your doctor or get emergency medical treatment if you experience any of the following symptoms: unusual movements; ringing in your ears; anxiety; memory problems; difficulty concentrating; sleep problems; seizures; shaking; muscle twitching; changes in mental health; depression; burning or prickling feeling in your hands, arms, legs or feet; seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear; thoughts of harming or killing yourself or others; overexcitement; or losing touch with reality.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Estazolam is used for the short-term treatment of insomnia (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep). Estazolam is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. It works by slowing activity in the brain to allow sleep.
How should this medicine be used?
Estazolam comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken as needed at bedtime or after going to bed and having difficulty falling asleep. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take estazolam exactly as directed.
You will probably become very sleepy after you take estazolam and may remain sleepy for some time. Plan to go to bed right after you take estazolam and to stay in bed for a full night. Do not take estazolam if you will be unable to remain asleep for a full night after you take the medication.
Your sleep problems should improve within 7 to 10 days after you start taking estazolam. Call your doctor if your sleep problems do not improve during this time, if they worsen at any time during your treatment, or if you notice any unusual changes in your thoughts or behavior.
If your doctor has told you to take estazolam regularly, talk to your doctor before you stop taking this medication. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking estazolam, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body, stomach and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, sad mood, seeing things or hearing sounds that do not exist, and seizures.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with estazolam and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking estazolam,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to estazolam; any other medications, or any of the ingredients in estazolam tablets. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor if you are taking ketoconazole (Nizoral) or itraconazole (Onmel, Sporanox). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take estazolam if you are taking either of these medications.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: certain antibiotics such as erythromycin (E.E.S., Erythrocin, E-Mycin); antidepressants; antihistamines; barbiturates such as phenobarbital or pentobarbital; cimetidine (Tagamet); digoxin (Lanoxin); diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac); disulfiram (Antabuse); fluvoxamine (Luvox); isoniazid (Laniazid, in Rifamate, in Rifater); medications for mental illness or nausea; medications for seizures such as carbamazepine (Equetro, Tegretol, Teril) and phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek); monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, including isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar), and tranylcypromine (Parnate); nefazodone; rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane, in Rifamate, in Rifater); sedatives; sleeping pills; and tranquilizers. Many other medications may also interact with estazolam, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have ever thought about killing or harming yourself or planned or tried to do so and if you have or have ever had  seizures, breathing problems or lung disease, or kidney or liver disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking estazolam, call your doctor immediately.
talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking estazolam if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should not usually take estazolam because it is not as safe as other medications that can be used to treat the same condition.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking estazolam.
you should know that this medication may make you drowsy during the daytime. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
you should know that some people who took medications for sleep got out of bed and drove their cars, prepared and ate food, had sex, made phone calls, or were involved in other activities while partially asleep. After they woke up, these people were usually unable to remember what they had done. Call your doctor right away if you find out that you have been driving or doing anything else while you were sleeping.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
You will probably be told to take estazolam as needed. If your doctor tells you to take estazolam regularly and you miss a dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one and do not take estazolam unless you are ready to go to bed and stay asleep for a full night.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Estazolam may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
hangover effect (grogginess)
drowsiness
dizziness
weakness
dry mouth
constipation
aggression
agitation
changes in behavior
slowed or uncoordinated movements

The question asks what to do if you forget a dose of Estazolam. The answer suggests skipping the missed dose and continuing with the regular dosing schedule. Upon examining the context, I see that it discusses important warnings, side effects, storage and disposal, overdose, and other information related to Estazolam use. However, there is no indication in this context that would suggest the need for a specific procedure when forgetting a dose.

VERDICT 0.0
>> #Reasoning#:
The given answer is "Skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule." To determine if this answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information, I will compare it with the provided context.

The context states that Estazolam may increase the risk of serious or life-threatening changes in behavior, slowed or uncoordinated movements, muscle stiffness, leg pain, and other side effects. It also warns about the importance of not flushing medication down the toilet and provides information on how to dispose of it properly. Additionally, there is a section on overdose and emergency procedures.

The answer does not take into account any potential consequences of taking Estazolam after missing a dose. It simply advises skipping the missed dose and continuing with regular dosing. This lack of consideration for potential risks or side effects is unusual, especially given the context's emphasis on serious and life-threatening changes.

Furthermore, the context does not provide any information about the frequency or timing of taking Estazolam, making it unclear what "regular dosing schedule" would even mean in this case.

VERDICT 1.0
>> #Reasoning#:

The given answer is "Skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule." The question asks what to do if I forget a dose of Estazolam. The context provided lists several important warnings, side effects, and storage/disposal instructions for Estazolam.

Upon reviewing the context, I notice that there are no specific guidelines or recommendations regarding missed doses or overdoses. However, the context does mention that some side effects can be serious, and it encourages patients to call their doctor immediately if they experience any unusual problems while taking the medication.

Given this information, I would expect a more detailed response from the medical expert, such as suggesting that the patient contact their doctor or pharmacist for guidance on managing a missed dose. Instead, the answer simply instructs the patient to "skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule."

Based on my analysis, I believe that the given answer contains hallucinated information of type 2: factual contradiction between the answer and the provided context. The answer appears to be oversimplifying the situation and neglecting potential risks or consequences of missing a dose.

>> #Context#: Why is this medication prescribed?
Fluvastatin is used together with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Fluvastatin is also used to decrease the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood. Fluvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Fluvastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.
Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with fluvastatin has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.
How should this medicine be used?
Fluvastatin comes as a capsule and an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The capsule is usually taken with or without food once a day at bedtime or twice a day. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take fluvastatin at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fluvastatin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.
Your doctor may start you on a low dose of fluvastatin and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 4 weeks.
Continue to take fluvastatin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking fluvastatin without talking to your doctor.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking fluvastatin,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to fluvastatin, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in fluvastatin capsules or extended release tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients..
some medications should not be taken with fluvastatin. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting fluvastatin with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping, or changing any medications while taking fluvastatin, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.
tell your doctor if you have liver disease. Your doctor will order laboratory tests to see how well your liver is working even if you do not think you have liver disease.Your doctor will probably tell you not to take fluvastatin if you have liver disease or if the tests show that you may be developing liver disease.
tell your doctor if you drink more than 2 alcoholic beverages per day, if you are 65 years of age or older, and if you have ever had liver disease or have or ever had muscle aches or weakness, diabetes, low blood pressure, seizures, or thyroid or kidney disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking fluvastatin, stop taking fluvastatin and call your doctor. Your doctor will discuss risks and benefits of fluvastatin therapy during pregnancy.
do not breast-feed while you are taking this medication.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking fluvastatin. If you are hospitalized due to infection or serious injury, tell the doctor who treats you that you are taking fluvastatin.
ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking fluvastatin. Alcohol can increase the risk of serious side effects.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Eat a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. Be sure to follow all exercise and dietary recommendations made by your doctor or dietitian. You can also visit the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) website for additional dietary information at
http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/chol/chol_tlc.pdf

#Question#: What are the side effects or risks of Fluvastatin?

#Answer#: Memory loss or forgetfulness, confusion, lack of energy, flu-like symptoms, rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing or swallowing, swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs, hoarseness, headache, muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, nausea, unusual bleeding or bruising, loss of appetite

#Reasoning#: To determine if the given answer contains hallucinations or non-factual information, I will compare it with the provided context.

The context mentions that Fluvastatin may cause side effects such as headache, heartburn, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, sinus pain, cough, memory loss or forgetfulness, confusion, and others. The answer also includes some of these mentioned side effects, but it does not introduce any new information that is not present in the context.

However, the answer also mentions "lack of energy," which is not explicitly stated as a side effect in the context. Additionally, the answer does not include all the side effects listed in the context, such as muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, fever, yellowing of the skin or eyes, and others.

#Verdict#: No

#Question#: What are the side effects or risks of Fluvastatin?

#Answer#: Memory loss or forgetfulness, confusion, lack of energy, flu-like symptoms, rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing or swallowing, swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs, hoarseness, headache, muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, nausea, unusual bleeding or bruising, loss of appetite

#Reasoning#: The answer provided lists various side effects and risks associated with Fluvastatin. Upon reviewing the given context, I can see that some of these side effects are explicitly mentioned as potential adverse reactions to Fluvastatin. For instance, "headache", "memory loss or forgetfulness", and "confusion" are all listed as possible side effects in the original text.

However, upon closer inspection, I noticed that the answer also includes some additional side effects not explicitly mentioned in the context, such as "flu-like symptoms", "rash", "hives", "itching", "difficulty breathing or swallowing", and "swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs". These side effects may be plausible and reasonable, but they are not directly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, I would argue that the given answer contains hallucinations or non-factual information, specifically with regards to the additional side effects listed. These side effects cannot be correctly inferred from the knowledge presented in the context alone.

#Reasoning#: Upon reviewing the provided text, I noticed that most of the side effects mentioned in the answer are actually listed as potential side effects in the original text. However, I did not find any information suggesting that Fluvastatin causes "lack of energy", "flu-like symptoms", or "unusual bleeding or bruising". These may be common side effects for other medications or conditions, but they are not explicitly mentioned as related to Fluvastatin.

#Reasoning#: The provided answer contains a list of potential side effects or risks associated with Fluvastatin.

These additional side effects seem to be an attempt to provide a comprehensive list of potential risks, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the context. As such, I conclude that these extra side effects may be hallucinated information, as they cannot be directly inferred from the provided context.

>> #Context#: Why is this medication prescribed?
Roflumilast is used in people with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways) to reduce the number of episodes or worsening of COPD symptoms. Roflumilast is in a class of medications called phosphodiesterase inhibitors. It works by decreasing swelling in the lungs.
How should this medicine be used?
Roflumilast comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day. Take roflumilast at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take roflumilast exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Do not use roflumilast to treat sudden attacks of breathing problems. Talk to your doctor about the use of other medications to treat symptoms of a sudden breathing problem.
Roflumilast may control COPD but does not cure it. Continue to take roflumilast even if you feel well. Do not stop taking roflumilast without talking to your doctor.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with roflumilast and each time you refill your prescription.  Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking roflumilast,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to roflumilast, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in roflumilast tablets. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.

Be sure to mention any of the following: carbamazepine (Tegretol), cimetidine (Tagamet),  enoxacin (not available in the U.S.), erythromycin (E.E.S., E-Mycin, Erythrocin), fluvoxamine, ketoconazole (Nizoral), phenobarbital, phenytoin (Dilantin), rifampicin and certain oral contraceptives ('birth control pills'). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have liver disease. Your doctor may tell you not to take roflumilast.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a history of mental health conditions, including depression; thoughts about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so;  extreme worry; or other unusual changes in your behavior or mood. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking roflumilast.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking Roflumilast, call your doctor.
you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways during treatment with roflumilast. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following new symptoms or a worsening of these symptoms: difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; or changes in mood. Be sure that your family or caregiver know these symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.
you should know that roflumilast can cause weight loss. Your weight should be checked regularly by your doctor and you should also check your weight on a regular basis during treatment with roflumilast. If you notice you are losing weight, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

#Answer#: Call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222. If the victim has collapsed, had a seizure, has trouble breathing, or can't be awakened, immediately call emergency services at 911.

#Reasoning#: To determine if the answer contains hallucinations or non-factual information, I will compare it with the given context and question.

Firstly, I will check if the answer misunderstands the question context. In this case, the question asks what to do in case of emergency or overdose of Roflumilast, which is a specific medication. The answer provides general guidance on what to do in an emergency situation, such as calling poison control and emergency services, which does not contradict with the provided context.

Next, I will check if there is a factual contradiction between the answer and the provided context. The given context explains that Roflumilast is used for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but it does not provide information about the medication being toxic or having severe side effects that would require immediate emergency attention.

Finally, I will check if the answer can be correctly inferred from the knowledge provided. The given context provides information on how to dispose of unneeded medications and the importance of keeping all medication out of sight and reach of children. However, it does not provide any specific information about Roflumilast's overdose symptoms or toxicity.

Based on my reasoning process, I conclude that the answer does not contain hallucinations or non-factual information.

#Verdict#: No

>> #Context#: Why is this medication prescribed?
Ciclopirox topical solution is used along with regular nail trimming to treat fungal infections of the fingernails and toenails (an infection that may cause nail discoloration, splitting and pain). Ciclopirox is in a class of medications called antifungals. It works by stopping the growth of nail fungus.
How should this medicine be used?
Ciclopirox comes as a solution to apply to nails and the skin immediately surrounding and under the nails. It is usually applied once a day. To help you remember to use ciclopirox, apply it around the same time every day, usually at bedtime. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ciclopirox exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Ciclopirox is used to improve the condition of nails, but may not completely cure nail fungus. It may take 6 months or longer before you notice that your nails are getting better. Continue to use ciclopirox daily as directed. Do not stop using ciclopirox without talking to your doctor.
Ciclopirox topical solution will work best if you trim your nails regularly during your treatment. You should remove all loose nail or nail material using a nail clipper or nail file before you begin treatment and every week during your treatment. Your doctor will show you how to do this. Your doctor will also trim your nails once each month during your treatment.
Only apply ciclopirox topical solution to your nails and the skin under and around your nails. Be careful not to get the solution on any other areas of the skin or parts of your body, especially in or near your eyes, nose, mouth, or vagina.
Do not use nail polish or other nail cosmetic products on nails treated with ciclopirox topical solution.
Do not take a bath, shower, or swim for at least 8 hours after applying ciclopirox topical solution.
Ciclopirox topical solution may catch fire. Do not use this medication near heat or an open flame, such as a cigarette.
To use ciclopirox topical solution, follow these steps:
Be sure that you have trimmed your nails properly before your first treatment.
Use the applicator brush attached to the bottle cap to apply ciclopirox topical solution evenly to all affected nails. Also apply the solution to the underside of the nail and the skin beneath it if you can reach these areas.
Wipe off the bottle cap and neck and replace the cap tightly on the bottle.
Let the solution dry for about 30 seconds before you put on socks or stockings.
When it is time for your next dose, apply ciclopirox topical solution over the medication that is already on your nails.
Once a week, remove all the ciclopirox from your nail(s) with a cotton square or tissue soaked with rubbing alcohol. Then, remove as much of the damaged nail as possible using scissors, nail clippers, or nail files.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using ciclopirox topical solution,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ciclopirox or any other medications.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking. Be sure to mention any of the following: inhaled steroids such as beclomethasone (Beconase, Vancenase), budesonide (Pulmicort, Rhinocort), flunisolide (AeroBid); fluticasone (Advair, Flonase, Flovent), mometasone (Nasonex), and triamcinolone (Azmacort, Nasacort, Tri-Nasal); oral medications to treat fungal infections such as fluconazole (Diflucan), itraconazole (Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral), terbinafine (Lamisil) and voriconazole (Vfend); medications for seizures; and steroid creams, lotions, or ointments such as alclometasone (Aclovate), betamethasone (Alphatrex, Betatrex, Diprolene, others), clobetasol (Cormax, Temovate), desonide (DesOwen, Tridesilon), desoximetasone (Topicort), diflorasone (Maxiflor, Psorcon), fluocinolone (DermaSmoothe, Synalar), fluocinonide (Lidex), flurandrenolide (Cordran), halcinonide (Halor), hydrocortisone (Cortizone, Westcort, others), mometasone (Elocon), prednicarbate (Dermatop), and triamcinolone (Aristocort, Kenalog, others). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had an organ transplant, if you have recently had chicken pox, and if you have or have ever had any disease that affects your immune system, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID); cancer; cold sores; diabetes; flaky, itchy, or crusty skin; genital herpes (sexually transmitted disease that causes painful blisters on reproductive organs); shingles (painful blisters caused by the chicken pox virus); fungal infections on your skin such as athlete's foot and ringworm (ring-shaped discolored patches of scales and blisters on the skin, hair, or nails); peripheral vascular disease (narrowing of blood vessels in feet, legs, or arms causing numbness, pain, or coldness in that part of the body); or seizures.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking ciclopirox, call your doctor.
you should know that you should keep your nails clean and dry during treatment with ciclopirox topical solution. Do not share nail care tools. Use different tools for infected and healthy nails. If your toenails are affected, wear well-fitting, low heeled shoes, and change them change frequently, and do not go barefoot in public areas. Wear protective shoes and gloves when playing sports, using strong cleaners, or during work that might injure or irritate fingernails and toenails.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Ciclopirox topical solution may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if the following symptom is severe or does not go away:
redness at the place where you applied ciclopirox
Some side effects can be serious. The following symptoms are uncommon, but if you experience any of them, call your doctor immediately:
irritation, itching, burning, blistering, swelling, or oozing at the place where you applied ciclopirox
pain at the affected nail(s) or surrounding area
discoloration or change in shape of nail(s)
ingrown nail(s)
Ciclopirox topical solution may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.
If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch
) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).
What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?
Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Keep the bottle of ciclopirox topical solution in the package it came in, away from light.
Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website (
http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p
) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.
It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location â one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.
http://www.upandaway.org
What other information should I know?
Keep all appointments with your doctor.
Do not let anyone else use your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription.
It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.

>> #Context#: What is it?
Blueberries are edible fruits from the Vaccinium angustifolium plant. Blueberry is a common food and is also sometimes used as medicine.
Blueberries are high in fiber, which can help with normal digestion. They also contain vitamin C, other antioxidants, and chemicals that might reduce swelling and destroy cancer cells.
People use blueberry for aging, memory and thinking skills, high blood pressure, athletic performance, diabetes, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
Don't confuse blueberry with bilberry. They are related but they are not the same. In countries outside of the US, the name blueberry is used to refer to the plant that is often called bilberry in the US.
How effective is it?
Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database
rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.
The effectiveness ratings for
BLUEBERRY
are as follows:
Possibly ineffective for...
High blood pressure
. Eating freeze-dried blueberries or taking blueberry powder by mouth doesn't lower blood pressure in people with high blood pressure or other heart disease risk factors.
There is interest in using blueberry for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Blueberry whole fruit, juice, and powders are commonly consumed in foods. Drinks made with freeze-dried blueberries might cause constipation, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting in some people.
There isn't enough reliable information to know if taking blueberry leaf is safe or what the side effects might be.
When applied to the skin
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if blueberry is safe or what the side effects might be.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: Blueberry fruit is commonly consumed in foods. But there isn't enough reliable information to know if blueberry is safe to use in larger amounts as medicine when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency
: G6PD is a genetic disorder. People with this disorder have problems breaking down some chemicals in food and drugs. One or more of these chemicals are found in blueberries. If you have G6PD, check with your healthcare provider before eating blueberries.
Surgery
: Blueberry fruit and leaf might affect blood glucose levels and could interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery.
Are there interactions with medications?
Minor
Be watchful with this combination.
Buspirone (BuSpar)
Blueberry juice might decrease how fast the body gets rid of buspirone. But this is not likely to be a major concern.
Flurbiprofen (Ansaid, others)
Blueberry juice might decrease how fast the body gets rid of flurbiprofen. But this is not likely to be a major concern.
Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)
Blueberry fruit or leaf might lower blood sugar levels. Taking blueberry along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.
Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?
Herbs and supplements that might lower blood sugar
Blueberry fruit or leaf might lower blood sugar. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might lower blood sugar too much. Examples of supplements with this effect include aloe, bitter melon, cassia cinnamon, chromium, and prickly pear cactus.
Are there interactions with foods?
Drinking milk along with blueberries might lower the potential health benefits of blueberries. Consuming blueberries 1-2 hours before or after drinking milk might prevent this interaction.
How is it typically used?
Blueberries are commonly consumed in foods. As medicine, freeze-dried blueberries have most often been used by adults in doses of 22-50 grams by mouth daily for up to 16 weeks. Blueberry extracts and blueberry leaf extracts have also been used. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what type of product and dose might be best for a specific condition.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: What is it?
Coconut water is the clear liquid found inside immature coconuts (Cocos nucifera). As the coconut matures, the water is replaced by coconut meat.
Coconut water is rich in carbohydrates and electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium. Because of these electrolytes, thereâs a lot of interest in using coconut water to treat and prevent dehydration. Coconut water is sometimes called green coconut water because the immature coconuts are green.
People commonly use coconut water as a beverage and as a solution for treating dehydration related to diarrhea or exercise. Itâs also used for high blood pressure and athletic performance, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
Donât confuse coconut water with coconut or coconut oil. These are not the same. Also, coconut water is different than coconut milk. Coconut milk is made from a mixture of the grated meat of a mature coconut.
How effective is it?
There is interest in using coconut milk for a number of purposes, but there isnât enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Coconut water is commonly consumed as a drink and is likely safe. Itâs usually well-tolerated.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: Coconut water is commonly consumed as a drink. There isn't enough reliable information to know if coconut water is safe to use as medicine when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.

: Coconut water is commonly consumed as a drink and seems to be safe for children. As medicine, itâs possibly safe when used appropriately.
Cystic fibrosis
: Cystic fibrosis can lower salt levels in the body. Some people with cystic fibrosis need to take fluids or pills to increase salt (sodium) levels. Coconut water doesnât contain enough salt to increase salt levels in people with cystic fibrosis. Also, it might contain too much potassium. Don't drink coconut water as way to increase salt levels if you have cystic fibrosis.
High levels of potassium in the blood
: Coconut water contains high levels of potassium. Don't drink coconut water if you have high levels of potassium in the blood.
Kidney problems
: Coconut water contains high levels of potassium. Normally, potassium is excreted in the urine if blood levels get too high. But this doesnât happen if the kidneys arenât working normally. If you have kidney problems, talk to your healthcare provider before taking coconut water.
Surgery
: Coconut water might interfere with blood pressure and blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop using coconut water at least two weeks before a scheduled surgery.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: What is it?
Maritime pine trees (Pinus pinaster) grow in countries on the Mediterranean Sea. Its bark may be helpful for asthma and improved leg circulation.
Maritime pine contains chemicals that might improve blood flow, stimulate the immune system, reduce swelling, prevent infections, and have antioxidant effects. Maritime pine trees that grow in southwest France are used to make Pycnogenol, the trademarked name for a specific maritime pine bark extract.
Maritime pine bark extract is used for asthma, high cholesterol, decline in memory, ADHD, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses.
How effective is it?
Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database
rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.
The effectiveness ratings for
MARITIME PINE
are as follows:
Possibly effective for...
Asthma
. Taking a specific maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol) by mouth daily, along with asthma medications, seems to decrease asthma symptoms and the need for rescue inhalers in children and adults with asthma. Keep in mind that maritime pine bark extract shouldn't be used in place of asthma medicine.
Poor circulation that can cause the legs to swell (chronic venous insufficiency or CVI)
. Taking a specific maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol) by mouth seems to reduce leg pain and heaviness, as well as swelling, in people with circulation problems.
Osteoarthritis
. Taking a specific maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol) by mouth might improve some symptoms of knee osteoarthritis. It also might reduce the need for pain medications in some people.
Possibly ineffective for...
High cholesterol
. Taking a specific maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol) doesn't lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL or "bad") cholesterol in people with high cholesterol.
There is interest in using maritime pine bark for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: A specific maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol) is possibly safe when taken in doses of 50-450 mg daily for up to one year. It might cause dizziness and stomach problems in some people.
When applied to the skin
: A specific maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol) is possibly safe when used as a cream for up to 7 days or as a powder for up to 6 weeks.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy
: Taking a specific maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol) is possibly safe when used in late pregnancy. But until more is known, it should be used cautiously or avoided during pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if maritime pine is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Children
: A specific maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol) is possibly safe to take by mouth for up to 3 months in children 6-18 years of age.
"Auto-immune diseases" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions
: Maritime pine might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using maritime pine.
Bleeding conditions
: Taking high doses of maritime pine might increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding conditions.
Surgery
: Maritime pine might slow blood clotting and reduce blood sugar. There is some concern that it might cause blood sugar to go too low and increase the chance of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using maritime pine at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: What is it?
Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) is a bushy shrub native to northeast Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina. It's best known as a natural sweetener.
Stevia contains chemicals that are 200-300 times sweeter than sucrose sugar.
People take stevia for obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
In the US, stevia leaves and extracts are available as supplements, but are not approved for use as sweeteners. Rebaudioside A (also called rebiana), one of the chemicals in stevia, is approved as a food sweetener.
How effective is it?
There is interest in using stevia for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Certain chemicals in stevia, including stevioside and rebaudioside A, are likely safe when used as a food sweetener. Side effects might include bloating, nausea, dizziness, and numbness.
There isn't enough reliable information to know if whole stevia or stevia extracts are safe or what the side effects might be.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if it is safe to take stevia when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Allergy to ragweed and related plants
: Stevia is in the Asteraceae/Compositae plant family. This family includes ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many other plants.   In theory, people who are sensitive to ragweed and related plants may also be sensitive to stevia.
Are there interactions with medications?
Moderate
Be cautious with this combination.
Lithium
Stevia might have an effect like a water pill or "diuretic." Taking stevia might decrease how well the body gets rid of lithium. This could increase how much lithium is in the body and result in serious side effects. Talk with your healthcare provider before using this product if you are taking lithium. Your lithium dose might need to be changed.
Minor
Be watchful with this combination.
Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)
Stevia might lower blood sugar levels. Taking stevia along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.
Medications for high blood pressure (Antihypertensive drugs)
Stevia might lower blood pressure. Taking stevia along with medications that lower blood pressure might cause blood pressure to go too low. Monitor your blood pressure closely.

>> #Context#: What is it?
Lipase is an enzyme that breaks down fats during digestion. It is found in many plants, animals, bacteria, and molds. Some people use lipase as a medicine.
Since lipase breaks down fat into smaller pieces, it is possible that lipase supplements might make digestion easier.
Lipase is used for indigestion (dyspepsia), heartburn, and other gastrointestinal problems, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
Do not confuse lipase with pancreatic enzyme products. Pancreatic enzyme products contain multiple ingredients, including lipase. Some of these products are approved by the US FDA for digestion problems due to a disorder of the pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency).
How effective is it?
There is interest in using lipase for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if lipase is safe or what the side effects might be.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if lipase is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Children
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if lipase is safe for full-term infants or older children. But in premature infants, a specific form of lipase, called bile salt-stimulated lipase, is possibly unsafe. Adding this type of lipase to formula can increase the risk of side effects in the gut.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: What is it?
Goji (Lycium chinense; Lycium barbarum) is a shrub. The berries, berry juice, and root bark have been used for many purposes, but with little evidence.
Goji grows in the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It contains chemicals that might help lower blood pressure and blood sugar. It might also help stimulate the immune system and protect organs.
Goji is used for many conditions including diabetes, weight loss, improving quality of life, and as a tonic, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any of these uses.
How effective is it?
There is interest in using goji for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Goji fruit is possibly safe when taken short-term. Up to 15 grams of goji fruit daily has been used safely for up to 4 months. In rare cases, goji fruit can cause allergic reactions.
There isn't enough reliable information available to know if other parts of the goji plant are safe or what the side effects might be.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if goji is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. There is some concern that goji fruit might cause the uterus to contract. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Allergy to protein in certain products
: Goji might cause an allergic reaction in people who are allergic to tobacco, peaches, tomatoes, and nuts.
Are there interactions with medications?
Major
Do not take this combination.
Warfarin (Coumadin)
Warfarin is used to slow blood clotting. Goji might increase how long warfarin is in the body. This might increase the chances of bruising and bleeding. Be sure to have your blood checked regularly. The dose of your warfarin might need to be changed.
Moderate
Be cautious with this combination.
Flecainide (Tambocor)
Flecainide is used to reduce irregular heartbeat. Goji might increase the levels of flecainide in the body. This can increase the risk of flecainide toxicity and serious heart issues.
Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) substrates)
Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Goji might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.
Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) substrates)
Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Goji might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.
Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) substrates)
Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Goji might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.
Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates)
Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Goji might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.
Medications for high blood pressure (Antihypertensive drugs)
Goji root bark might lower blood pressure. Taking goji along with medications that lower blood pressure might cause blood pressure to go too low. Monitor your blood pressure closely.
Minor
Be watchful with this combination.
Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)
Goji might lower blood sugar levels. Taking goji along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.
Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?
Herbs and supplements that might lower blood pressure
Goji root bark might lower blood pressure. Taking it with other supplements that have the same effect might cause blood pressure to drop too much. Examples of supplements with this effect include andrographis, casein peptides, L-arginine, niacin, and stinging nettle.
Herbs and supplements that might lower blood sugar
Goji might lower blood sugar. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might lower blood sugar too much. Examples of supplements with this effect include aloe, bitter melon, cassia cinnamon, chromium, and prickly pear cactus.
Are there interactions with foods?
There are no known interactions with foods.
How is it typically used?
There isn't enough reliable information to know what an appropriate dose of goji might be. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult a healthcare professional before using.

>> #Context#: What is it?
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a chemical in the Cannabis sativa plant, also known as cannabis or hemp. One specific form of CBD is approved as a drug in the U.S. for seizures.
Over 80 chemicals, known as cannabinoids, have been found in the Cannabis sativa plant. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the most famous ingredient in cannabis. But CBD is obtained from hemp, a form of the Cannabis sativa plant that only contains small amounts of THC. CBD seems to have effects on some chemicals in the brain, but these are different than the effects of THC.
A prescription form of CBD is used for seizure disorder (epilepsy). CBD is also used for anxiety, pain, a muscle disorder called dystonia, Parkinson disease, Crohn disease, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
Laws passed in 2018 made it legal to sell hemp and hemp products in the US. But that doesn't mean that all CBD products made from hemp are legal. Since CBD is an approved prescription drug, it can't be legally included in foods or dietary supplements. CBD can only be included in "cosmetic" products. But there are still CBD products on the market that are labeled as dietary supplements. The amount of CBD contained in these products is not always the same as what is stated on the label.
How effective is it?
Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database
rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.
The effectiveness ratings for
CANNABIDIOL (CBD)
are as follows:
Likely effective for...
Seizure disorder (epilepsy)
. A specific prescription product (Epidiolex, GW Pharmaceuticals) is approved by the US FDA to treat seizures caused by Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis complex. It is unclear if other forms of CBD are helpful for seizure. For now, stick with the prescription product.
There is interest in using CBD for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful for these uses.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: CBD is possibly safe to take in appropriate doses. Doses of up to 200 mg daily have been used safely for up to 13 weeks. With the guidance of a healthcare provider, a specific prescription CBD product (Epidiolex) has been used at higher doses and for longer durations.
CBD can cause some side effects, such as dry mouth, low blood pressure, light headedness, and drowsiness. Signs of liver injury have also been reported with high doses of the prescription form of CBD, called Epidiolex.
When applied to the skin
: A specific cannabis extract spray that contains cannabidiol and THC (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) is possibly safe when used for up to 2 years. This product is a prescription drug in the UK and Canada. It is an investigation drug in the US.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: It may be unsafe to take CBD if you are pregnant or breast feeding. CBD products can be contaminated with other ingredients that may be harmful to the fetus or infant. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Children
: It is possibly safe for children to take a specific prescription CBD product (Epidiolex) by mouth in doses up to 25 mg/kg daily. This product is approved for use in children with certain conditions who are at least 1 year old. It isn't clear if other CBD products are safe in children.
A group of eye disorders that can lead to vision loss (glaucoma)
: Some early research suggests that taking CBD might increase the pressure in the eye in some people with glaucoma.
Liver disease
: People with liver disease may need to use lower doses of CBD.
Parkinson disease
: Some early research suggests that taking high doses of CBD might make muscle movement and tremors worse in some people with Parkinson disease.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: What is it?
Lycopene is a type of organic pigment called a carotenoid. It is related to beta-carotene and gives some vegetables and fruits (e.g., tomatoes) a red color.
Lycopene is a powerful antioxidant that might help protect cells from damage. It's found in tomato, watermelon, red orange, pink grapefruit, apricot, rose hip, and guava.
Lycopene is used for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cancer, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.
How effective is it?
Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database
rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.
The effectiveness ratings for
LYCOPENE
are as follows:
Possibly effective for...
Prostate cancer
. Taking lycopene by mouth might slightly reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. It might also slightly reduce the risk of prostate cancer returning.
Possibly ineffective for...
Bladder cancer
. People who eat more lycopene in their diet don't seem to have a lower risk for bladder cancer.
Diabetes
. People who eat more lycopene in their diet don't seem to have a lower risk of developing diabetes. Also, people with diabetes who eat more lycopene don't seem to have a lower risk of dying from heart disease.
There is interest in using lycopene for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Lycopene is commonly consumed in certain fruits and vegetables. When taken in supplements, doses of 15-45 mg daily have been safely used for up to 6 months.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: Lycopene is likely safe during pregnancy and breast-feeding when eaten in typical food amounts. There isn't enough reliable information to know if lycopene supplements are safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts.
Surgery
: Lycopene might slow blood clotting. It might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using lycopene supplements at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.
Are there interactions with medications?
Moderate
Be cautious with this combination.
Medications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs)
Lycopene might slow blood clotting. Taking lycopene along with medications that also slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.
Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?
Beta-carotene
Taking beta-carotene along with lycopene may alter the amount of lycopene that is absorbed from the gut.
Calcium
Taking calcium along with lycopene may decrease the amount of lycopene that is absorbed from the gut.
Herbs and supplements that might slow blood clotting
Lycopene might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might increase the risk of bleeding in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include garlic, ginger, ginkgo, nattokinase, and Panax ginseng.
Lutein
Taking lutein along with lycopene may alter the amount of lycopene that is absorbed from the gut.
Are there interactions with foods?
Fat substitutes such as olestra might reduce the amount of lycopene that is absorbed by the body. Olestra seems to lower lycopene levels in healthy people by about 30%.
How is it typically used?
Lycopene is commonly found in many fruits and vegetables, but particularly in tomato products, including fresh tomatoes, tomato sauce, ketchup, and tomato juice. A 130 gram serving of fresh tomatoes contains 4-10 mg of lycopene. Ketchup contains 3.3 mg per tablespoon.
Lycopene supplements are also available. Lycopene has most often been used by adults in doses of 15-45 mg by mouth daily for up to 6 months. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.

RESPONSES
>> #Reasoning#: Upon reviewing the context and answer, I notice that the question asks about interactions between Lycopene and foods. The provided answer mentions that fat substitutes like olestra can increase the absorption of lycopene by about 30%. I will examine whether this information is consistent with the given context.

The provided context does not mention any specific foods or nutrients interacting with lycopene, except for a brief note on fat substitutes like olestra possibly reducing the amount of lycopene absorbed. This implies that there might be some influence of fat substitutes on lycopene absorption, but it's unclear whether this would lead to an increase or decrease in absorption.

The answer claims that olestra increases the absorption of lycopene by about 30%. However, the context does not explicitly state that olestra enhances the absorption of lycopene. Instead, it suggests a possible reduction in absorption. This discrepancy could be interpreted as an hallucination.

Furthermore, I did not find any supporting evidence in the given context for the specific claim made in the answer regarding olestra and increased lycopene absorption.

>> #Context#: What is it?
Capsicum, also known as red pepper or chili pepper, is an herb. Its fruit is commonly applied to the skin for arthritis pain and other conditions.
The fruit of the capsicum plant contains a chemical called capsaicin. Capsaicin is what seems to help reduce pain and swelling. A particular form of capsicum causes intense eye pain and other unpleasant effects when it comes in contact with the face. This form is used in self-defense pepper sprays.
Capsicum is commonly used for nerve pain and other painful conditions. It is also used for many other purposes, including digestion problems, conditions of the heart and blood vessels, and many others, but there is no good scientific evidence for many of these uses.
How effective is it?
Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database
rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.
The effectiveness ratings for
CAPSICUM
are as follows:
Likely effective for...
Nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy)
. A specific cream containing 0.075% capsaicin (Zostrix-HP, Link Medical Products Pty Ltd.) 4 times daily is approved for treating this condition. Another patch containing 8% capsaicin (Qutenza, NeurogesX, Inc.), which is available by prescription only, is also approved for treating this condition. Creams or gels that contain smaller amounts of capsaicin (less than 0.075%) don't seem to work.
Chronic pain
. Applying creams and lotions containing capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, can temporarily relieve chronic pain from several conditions. It's FDA approved for this use.
Nerve damage caused by shingles (postherpetic neuralgia)
. Applying a patch containing 8% capsaicin (Qutenza, NeurogesX Inc.), the active chemical in capsicum, reduces pain over 24 hours in people with this condition. This capsaicin patch is available by prescription only.
Possibly effective for...
Back pain
. Applying capsicum or capsaicin to the skin seems to help reduce back pain.
Cluster headache
. Applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, inside the nose can reduce the number and severity of cluster headaches. It's not clear if it helps treat cluster headaches.
Runny nose not caused by allergies or infection (nonallergic rhinitis)
. Applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, inside the nose can reduce runny nose in people who do not have allergies or an infection. The benefits might last for 6-9 months.
Osteoarthritis
. Applying 0.025% capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, to the skin can improve symptoms of osteoarthritis.
Acute pain
. Applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, to the skin can reduce pain from trauma.
Nausea and vomiting after surgery
. Applying a plaster containing capsicum to specific points on the hand and forearm reduces nausea and vomiting after surgery.
Pain after surgery
. Applying a plaster containing capsicum to specific points on the hand and forearm reduces the need for painkillers within the first 24 hours after surgery.
There is interest in using capsicum for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Capsicum is likely safe when consumed in amounts typically found in food. Capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, is possibly safe when used short-term. Side effects can include stomach irritation, sweating, and runny nose. Capsicum is possibly unsafe to take in large doses or for long periods of time.
When applied to the skin
: Lotions and creams that contain capsicum extract are likely safe for most adults. Capsaicin is approved by the FDA as an over-the-counter medication. Side effects can include skin irritation and itching. Capsicum can also be very irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat. Don't use capsicum on sensitive skin or near the eyes.
When used in the nose
: Capsicum is possibly safe. But, application in the nose can be painful and cause burning pain, sneezing, watery eyes, and runny nose.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy
: Capsicum is likely safe when applied to the skin during pregnancy. Capsicum is possibly safe when taken by mouth as a medicine during the second half of the second trimester and during the third trimester.
Breast-feeding
: If you are breast-feeding, using capsicum on your skin is likely safe. But it is possibly unsafe for your baby if you take capsicum by mouth. Skin problems (dermatitis) have been reported in breast-fed infants when mothers eat foods heavily spiced with capsicum peppers.
Children
: Applying capsicum to the skin of children under two years of age is possibly unsafe. There isn't enough reliable information to know if it is safe for children to use capsicum by mouth as a medicine. Stay on the safe side and stick with the amounts found in foods.
Bleeding disorders
: While conflicting results exist, capsicum might increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding disorders.
Damaged skin
: Don't use capsicum on damaged or broken skin.
High blood pressure
: Taking capsicum or eating a large amount of chili peppers might cause a spike in blood pressure. In theory, this might worsen the condition for people who already have high blood pressure.
Surgery
: Capsicum might increase bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using capsicum at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.
Are there interactions with medications?
Moderate
Be cautious with this combination.
Aspirin
Capsicum might decrease how much aspirin the body can absorb. Taking capsicum along with aspirin might reduce the effects of aspirin.
Ciprofloxacin (Cipro)
Capsicum might increase how much ciprofloxacin the body can absorb. Taking capsicum along with ciprofloxacin might increase the effects and side effects of ciprofloxacin.
Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)
Capsicum might lower blood sugar levels. Taking capsicum along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.
Medications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs)
Capsicum might slow blood clotting. Taking capsicum along with medications that also slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.
Theophylline
Capsicum can increase how much theophylline the body can absorb. Taking capsicum along with theophylline might increase the effects and side effects of theophylline.
Minor
Be watchful with this combination.
Medications for high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors)
Some medications for high blood pressure might cause a cough. There is one report of someone whose cough worsened when using a cream with capsicum along with these medications for high blood pressure. But it isn't clear if this interaction is a big concern.
Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?
Herbs and supplements that might lower blood sugar
Capsicum might lower blood sugar. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might lower blood sugar too much. Examples of supplements with this effect include aloe, bitter melon, cassia cinnamon, chromium, and prickly pear cactus.
Herbs and supplements that might slow blood clotting
Capsicum might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might increase the risk of bleeding in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include garlic, ginger, ginkgo, nattokinase, and Panax ginseng.
Iron
There is some concern that using capsicum might reduce how much iron the body can absorb.
Are there interactions with foods?
There are no known interactions with foods.
How is it typically used?
In adults, capsicum has been taken by mouth as extracts, chili, fermented red pepper, red pepper powder, lozenges, nectar, and capsaicin. In both adults and children, capsicum has been applied to the skin in creams, plasters, and gels. It's also used in nasal sprays and solutions. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what type of product and dose might be best for a specific condition.

Creatine is a chemical found naturally in the body. It's also in red meat and seafood. It is often used to improve exercise performance and muscle mass.
Creatine is involved in making energy for muscles. About 95% of it is found in skeletal muscle. The majority of sports supplements in the US contain creatine. People who have lower creatine levels when they start taking creatine seem to get more benefit than people who start with higher levels.
People commonly use creatine for improving exercise performance and increasing muscle mass. It is also used for muscle cramps, fatigue, multiple sclerosis (MS), depression, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.
Creatine use is allowed by the International Olympic Committee and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).
How effective is it?

rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.
The effectiveness ratings for
CREATINE
are as follows:
Possibly effective for...
Athletic performance
. Taking creatine by mouth seems to somewhat improve rowing, jumping, and soccer performance. It's not clear if it helps with sprinting, cycling, swimming, or tennis.
Disorders of creatine metabolism or transport
. Taking creatine by mouth daily can increase creatine levels in the brain in children and young adults with conditions called GAMT deficiency or AGAT deficiency. But taking creatine doesn't seem to improve brain creatine levels in children who have a disorder in which creatine isn't transported properly.
Muscle strength
. Taking creatine by mouth seems to somewhat improve muscle strength in both younger and older adults. It's not clear if applying creatine to the skin helps.
Age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia)
. Taking creatine by mouth for up to 12 weeks seems to improve muscle strength in older adults. It seems to work best when used along with exercise to build muscles.
Possibly ineffective for...
Lou Gehrig disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS)
. Taking creatine by mouth does not seem to slow disease progression or improve survival in people with ALS.
An inherited brain disorder that affects movements, emotions, and thinking (Huntington disease)
. Taking creatine by mouth does not improve symptoms in people with Huntington disease.
Low bone mass (osteopenia)
. Taking creatine by mouth doesn't seem to slow or reduce bone loss in people with osteopenia.
There is interest in using creatine for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Creatine is likely safe for most people. Doses up to 25 grams daily for up to 14 days have been safely used. Lower doses up to 4-5 grams daily for up to 18 months have also been safely used. Creatine is possibly safe when taken long-term. Doses up to 10 grams daily for up to 5 years have been safely used. Side effects might include dehydration, upset stomach, and muscle cramps.
When applied to the skin
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if creatine is safe. It might cause side effects such as redness and itching.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if creatine is safe to use when pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Children
: Creatine is possibly safe when taken by mouth, short-term. Creatine 3-5 grams daily for 2-6 months has been taken safely in children 5-18 years of age. Creatine 2 grams daily for 6 months has been taken safely in children 2-5 years of age. Creatine 0.1-0.4 grams/kg daily for up to 6 months has been taken safely in both infants and children.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: What is it?
Hops are the dried, flowering parts of the hop plant (Humulus lupulus), commonly used in brewing beer. They have limited evidence of health benefits.
The term "hops" comes from the Anglo-Saxon term "hoppan", which means "to climb." Hops contain many chemicals, including bitter acids, which contribute to its bitter flavor. Some chemicals in hops seem to act similarly to the hormone estrogen and some seem to cause sleepiness.
People commonly use hops for anxiety, sleep disorders, restlessness, symptoms of menopause, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
How effective is it?
There is interest in using hops for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
:

Hops are commonly consumed in foods. Hops extracts and hops bitter acids are possibly safe when used short-term. Hops extracts have been used safely in doses of up to 300 mg daily for up to 3 months. Hops bitter acids have been used safely in doses of 35 mg daily for 3 months. Hops might cause dizziness and sleepiness in some people.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if hops are safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Hormone sensitive cancers and conditions
: Some chemicals in hops act like the hormone estrogen. People who have conditions that are sensitive to estrogen should use caution when taking hops. Some of these conditions include breast cancer and endometriosis.
Surgery
: Hops might cause too much sleepiness when combined with anesthesia and other medications during and after surgical procedures. Stop taking hops at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.
Are there interactions with medications?
Moderate
Be cautious with this combination.
Estrogens
Hops might have some of the same effects as estrogen. Taking hops along with estrogen might decrease the effects of estrogen.
Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) substrates)
Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Hops might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.
Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates)
Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Hops might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.
Sedative medications (CNS depressants)
Hops might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Some medications, called sedatives, can also cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking hops with sedative medications might cause breathing problems and/or too much sleepiness.
Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?
Herbs and supplements with sedative properties
Hops might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking it along with other supplements with similar effects might cause too much sleepiness and/or slowed breathing in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include kava, L-tryptophan, melatonin, and valerian.
Herbs that might act like estrogen
Hops might have the same effects as estrogen. Using it along with other supplements with similar effects might increase estrogen-like effects and side effects. Examples of supplements with this effect include black cohosh, kudzu, peony, and red clover.
Are there interactions with foods?
There are no known interactions with foods.
How is it typically used?
Hops are available in many different types of products, including beverages, tablets, capsules, creams, and gels. There isn't enough reliable information to know what an appropriate dose of hops might be. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult a healthcare professional before using.

Chondroitin sulfate is a chemical found in human and animal cartilage. It is commonly used by mouth with glucosamine or other ingredients for osteoarthritis.
Chondroitin sulfate is one of the building blocks of cartilage. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage in the joints breaks down. Taking chondroitin sulfate might slow this breakdown. It is usually manufactured from animal sources, such as shark and cow cartilage. It can also be made in a lab.
Chondroitin sulfate is used for osteoarthritis and cataracts. It is often used together with other ingredients, including manganese ascorbate, hyaluronic acid, collagen peptides, or glucosamine. Chondroitin sulfate is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
How effective is it?
Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database
rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.
The effectiveness ratings for
CHONDROITIN SULFATE
are as follows:
Possibly effective for...
Cataracts
. An injectable solution containing chondroitin sulfate and sodium hyaluronate is approved by the FDA to protect the eye during cataract surgery. It is not clear if using it in a different form will help.
Osteoarthritis
. Taking chondroitin sulfate by mouth seems to provide some relief from osteoarthritis pain and improve function. High quality, pharmaceutical-grade products have shown the most benefit. Chondrosulf (IBSA Institut Biochimique SA), Chondrosan (Bioiberica, S.A.) and Structum (Laboratoires Pierre Fabre) are examples of these products.
There is interest in using chondroitin sulfate for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Chondroitin sulfate is likely safe when used for up to 6 years. It can cause some mild stomach pain and nausea. Other possible side effects include bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.
When placed into the eye
: Chondroitin sulfate is possibly safe when used together with other ingredients in an eye drop.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if chondroitin sulfate is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Asthma
: There is some concern that chondroitin sulfate might make asthma worse. If you have asthma, use chondroitin sulfate cautiously.
Prostate cancer
: Early research suggests that chondroitin might cause the spread or recurrence of prostate cancer. This effect has not been shown with chondroitin sulfate supplements. However, until more is known, do not take chondroitin sulfate if you have prostate cancer or are at high risk for developing it (you have a brother or father with prostate cancer).
Are there interactions with medications?
Moderate
Be cautious with this combination.
Warfarin (Coumadin)
Warfarin is used to slow blood clotting. There are several reports showing that taking chondroitin with glucosamine increases the effects of warfarin. This can cause bruising and bleeding that can be serious. Don't take chondroitin if you are taking warfarin.
Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?
Glucosamine
Taking chondroitin sulfate together with glucosamine hydrochloride might reduce blood levels of glucosamine. But it's not clear if this will change the effects of glucosamine hydrochloride. It's also not clear if this interaction occurs with other forms of glucosamine, such as glucosamine sulfate.
Are there interactions with foods?
There are no known interactions with foods.
How is it typically used?
Chondroitin sulfate is most commonly used by adults in doses of 800-1200 mg per day, for up to 2 years.
There is concern that some chondroitin sulfate products are not labeled accurately. Some products might contain no chondroitin, while other products might contain more than the amount stated on the product's label. Because of these issues, the effects of different chondroitin products may vary. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose or product might be best.

HALLUCINATION 1
PROMPTS
>> #Context#: What is it?
Spearmint (Mentha spicata) is a species of mint plant. It's grown for its leaves and essential oil, which is used as a flavoring in foods and cosmetics.
Spearmint oil contains chemicals that reduce swelling and affect hormone levels in the body, including testosterone. Some chemicals might also harm cancer cells and kill bacteria.
People use spearmint for memory, digestion, osteoarthritis, nausea and vomiting after surgery, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
Don't confuse spearmint with other plants known as mint, including English horsemint, Japanese mint, peppermint, perilla, salvia divinorum, or wild mint. These are not the same.
How effective is it?
There is interest in using spearmint for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Spearmint and spearmint oil are commonly consumed in foods. Spearmint is possibly safe when used as a medicine, short-term. It's usually well tolerated.
When applied to the skin
: Spearmint is possibly safe. It might cause an allergic reaction in some people, but this is rare.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy
: Spearmint and spearmint oil are commonly consumed in foods. But spearmint is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in large amounts during pregnancy. Very large doses of spearmint tea might damage the uterus. Avoid using large amounts of spearmint during pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
: Spearmint and spearmint oil are commonly consumed in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if larger amounts of spearmint are safe when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts.
Kidney disorders
: Spearmint tea might increase kidney damage. Using large amounts of spearmint tea might make kidney disorders worse.
Liver disease
: Spearmint tea might increase liver damage. Using large amounts of spearmint tea might make liver disease worse.
Are there interactions with medications?
Moderate
Be cautious with this combination.
Medications that can harm the liver (Hepatotoxic drugs)
Spearmint might harm the liver. Some medications can also harm the liver. Taking spearmint along with a medication that can harm the liver might increase the risk of liver damage.
Sedative medications (CNS depressants)
Spearmint might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Some medications, called sedatives, can also cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking spearmint with sedative medications might cause breathing problems and/or too much sleepiness.
Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?
Herbs and supplements that might harm the liver
Spearmint might harm the liver. Taking it with other supplements that can also harm the liver might increase the risk of liver damage. Examples of supplements with this effect include garcinia, greater celandine, green tea extract, kava, and kratom.
Herbs and supplements with sedative properties
Spearmint might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking it along with other supplements with similar effects might cause too much sleepiness and/or slowed breathing in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include hops, kava, L-tryptophan, melatonin, and valerian.
Are there interactions with foods?
There are no known interactions with foods.
How is it typically used?
Spearmint extract has most often been used by adults at a dose of 900 mg by mouth daily for up to 90 days. Spearmint tea has most often been used as two cups daily for up to 16 weeks. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.
