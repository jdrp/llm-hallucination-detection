>> #Context#: Toothing was originally a hoax claim that Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones or PDAs were being used to arrange random sexual encounters, perpetrated as a prank on the media who reported it. They based it on the two concepts dogging and bluejacking that were popular at the time. The creators started a forum in March 2004 where they wrote fake news articles about toothing with other members and then sent them off to well-known Internet-based news services. As observation is encouraged, voyeurism and exhibitionism are closely associated with dogging.
#Question#: Which two activites are closely associated with a popular 2004 concept which spurred  the hoax claim, Toothing?
