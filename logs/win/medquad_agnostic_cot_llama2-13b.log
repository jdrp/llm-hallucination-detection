PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Myelofibrosis is a disorder of the bone marrow in which the marrow is replaced by fibrous scar tissue.
Causes
Bone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside your bones. Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow that develop into all of your blood cells. Your blood is made of:
Red blood cells (which carry oxygen to your tissues)
White blood cells (which fight infection)
Platelets (which help your blood clot)
When the bone marrow is scarred, it cannot make enough blood cells.
Anemia
, bleeding problems, and a higher risk for infections may occur.
As a result, the liver and spleen try to make some of these blood cells. This causes these organs to swell.
The cause of myelofibrosis is often unknown. There are no known risk factors. When it occurs, it often develops slowly in people over age 50. Women and men are equally affected. There is an increased occurrence of this condition in Ashkenazi Jews.
Blood and bone marrow cancers, such as myelodysplastic syndrome,
leukemia
, and lymphoma, may also cause bone marrow scarring. This is called secondary myelofibrosis.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Abdominal fullness
, pain, or feeling full before finishing a meal (because ofÂ an enlarged spleen)
Bone pain
Easy bleeding,
bruising
Fatigue
Increased likelihood of getting an infection
Pale skin
Shortness of breath
with exercise
Weight loss
Night sweats
Low grade fever
Enlarged liver
Dry cough
Itchy skin
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.
Tests that may be done include:
Complete blood count
(CBC) with blood smear to check different types of blood cells
Measuring tissue damage (
LDH enzyme level
)
Molecular testing
Bone marrow biopsy
to diagnose the condition and to check for bone marrow cancers
Treatment
Bone marrow
or stem cell transplant may improve symptoms, and may cure the disease. This treatment is usually considered for younger people.
Other treatment may involve:
Blood transfusions and medicines to correct anemia
Radiation and
chemotherapy
Targeted medicines
Removal of the spleen (
splenectomy
) if swelling causes symptoms, or to help with anemia
Outlook (Prognosis)
As the disease worsens, the bone marrow slowly stops working. Low platelet count leads to easy bleeding. Spleen swelling may get worse along with anemia.
Survival of people with primary myelofibrosis is about 5 years. But some people survive for decades.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Development of
acute myelogenous leukemia
Infections
Bleeding
Blood clots
Liver failure
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Make an appointment with your provider if you have symptoms of this disorder. Seek medical care right away for uncontrolled bleeding, shortness of breath, or jaundice (yellow skin and whites of the eyes) that gets worse.

#Question#: What causes Myelofibrosis ?
#Answer#: The cause of myelofibrosis is often unknown, but it can develop due to blood and bone marrow cancers such as myelodysplastic syndrome, leukemia, and lymphoma, in a condition called secondary myelofibrosis.

#Instructions#:
I want you act as an answer judge. Given some context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information. You SHOULD give your judgement based on the following hallucination types and the given context.

Hallucination types:
1. The answer misunderstands the question context and intention.
2. There is a factual contradiction between the answer and the provided context. Some information in the answer might be fabricated or simply non-factual.
3. The answer cannot be correctly inferred from the knowledge.

You should try your best to determine if the answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information according to any of the above hallucination types. Do NOT judge whether the error was intentional or not, or its severity.
Explain your reasoning process and how you are contrasting the information in the given answer with the given answer.
Based on this reasoning, does the given answer contain hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line.
