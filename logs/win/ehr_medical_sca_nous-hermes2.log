#Question#: What is the chief complaint of the patient?
#Answer#: pleural effusion

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:


#Sentence#: <first sentence in the answer>

Report Text: **institution emergency department patient name: **name[aaa, bbb m] account #: **id-num date of service: **date[apr 08 06] primary care physician: **name[www m xxx] attending physician addendum: the history, examination, and emergency department plan and care were reviewed with the resident. i agree with the contents of the resident's dictation. i have also personally evaluated this patient. chief complaint: weakness. history of present illness: the patient is a **age[in 70s]-year-old woman who has had diarrhea over the last five days. she says this started as a gastrointestinal illness approximately five days ago. she had several days of bad diarrhea and, after discussion with her primary care physician over the telephone, was started on ciprofloxacin in the last several days. she says she has only had one bowel movement per day today and yesterday, so from that perspective, her diarrhea is decreasing in frequency, but today, she noticed worsening weakness to the point that she was quite lightheaded and unsteady on her feet. she has not noted any rectal blood. she has not had any significant abdominal discomfort, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, dysuria, urgency, frequency, any new extremity pains or swelling, or other acute complaints. the remainder of the review of systems is as per the resident's dictation and is otherwise negative. past medical history, medications, allergies, and social history are as per the resident's dictation. physical exam: generally, this is a comfortable-appearing woman in no respiratory distress. she is quite pleasant to talk to. vital signs are as per the resident's dictation. heent - head is without external evidence of trauma. sclerae are anicteric. nose and mouth are normal with moist mucous membranes. neck is supple; no jvd. lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. heart - regular rate and rhythm, no murmur. abdomen is soft and nontender. no rebound or guarding is present. extremities - nontender, no edema, no calf pain. neurologic - the patient is alert and oriented. strength is intact in all extremities without focal deficits. her gait was steady. assessment: this is a **age[in 70s]-year-old woman with general weakness today in the setting of five days of what initially started as a gastrointestinal illness and subsequently has been just loose stools over the last several days. she started antibiotics only after the onset of the diarrhea so our suspicion for c. difficile is relatively low. additionally, her diarrhea has been improving to the point that she has only had one episode per day each of the last few days. her appetite and oral intake continue to be quite poor; however, my suspicion is that dehydration is the primary etiology of her weakness. emergency department course: laboratory studies were obtained with complete results as per the resident's dictation. cbc was also obtained which was remarkable for a normal white blood count with a normal differential. the patient received iv hydration here and was also able to hydrate orally. she urinated several times, and her urine dip was negative for evidence of infection. her symptoms improved dramatically. she had no further bowel movements here. at this point, since she is feeling better and our suspicion for the etiology of her symptoms is dehydration, we have encouraged her to increase her oral fluid intake. she will finish her course of ciprofloxacin, and i anticipate her discharge home for followup with her primary physician, dr. **name[xxx]. we also did speak with dr. **name[xxx] while she was here as well. discharge diagnosis(es): 1. diarrhea and dehydration. 2. general weakness secondary to dehydration.

#Question#: What was the patient's chief complaint?
#Answer#: seizure

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.

diagnosis: degenerative arthritis, right hip. procedure: right minimally invasive total hip replacement under spinal anesthesia, image intensification. assistant: **name[xxx www], pa-c history: for several years this woman has experienced insidious onset and progression of pain in her right hip that became incapacitating despite conservative treatment. recent clinical and radiographic features were consistent with severe degenerative arthritis of the right hip. recommendation was made for right minimally invasive total hip replacement. the risks, complications, and therapeutic options were reviewed. the patient was agreeable to proceed. technique: the patient was draped and prepped in usual sterile fashion under spinal anesthesia. she was placed supine with an inflatable pad elevated under her right hip. with image intensification, the site for an oblique 5-cm incision anterior to the intertrochanteric ridge of the right proximal femur was identified. the incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia. a few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized. curved scissors was used to bluntly develop the interval between tensor and sartorius down to the underlying hip capsule. the traversing lateral circumflex vessels were identified, clamped, cauterized, and divided. the hip capsule was incised with the electrocautery along the axis of the femoral neck with supplementary releases around the acetabular rim, and along the intertrochanteric ridge. hip retractors were placed deep to the capsule. observation confirmed features of severe degenerative arthritis of the femoral head with complete erosion of articular cartilage and osteophytes. with image intensification, the site for a standard osteotomy of the proximal femur was identified. the osteotomy was completed with a reciprocal saw, along with a parallel cut through the equator of the femoral head. the neck fragment was impaled with a schanz screw to extract it. the head fragment was grasped with a bone clamp to remove it. the labrum was sharply excised. the acetabulum was debrided with curettes and rongeurs. periodically, profuse antibiotic irrigation with jet lavage was performed. the acetabulum was reamed incrementally with hemispherical reamers through size 54 mm. with imaging, a **name[vvv] trabecular metal shell of 54 mm was selected. the shell was inserted into the acetabulum on the aligning tool and impacted. supplementary anchorage was achieved with 2 of the 6.5 mm cancellous screws inserted into 3.2-mm drill holes with the use of a depth gauge. solid fixation of the shell was documented. a 10-degree anterior wall elevated polyethylene liner was impacted into the metal backing. attention was turned to the proximal femur. initially, the contralateral left hip was hyperextended by adjustment of the jupiter table. the right lower extremity was placed in the figure-of-four position. a box chisel was used on the osteotomized femoral neck. a 1 cm square of capsule was sharply excised from the lateral aspect of the neck. curved scissors was used to incise the capsule above the neck. lines were drawn on the thigh to identify the site for the second 3-cm incision high in the lateral aspect of the hip. the incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia. a few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized. curved scissors were used to bluntly develop a tunnel through gluteus maximus into the hip joint. the 3 sizers of hip dilator were used to enlarge the tunnel. a pointed awl was used to impale the osteotomized femoral neck. a ball-ended guidewire was passed down the femoral canal for flexible reaming incrementally through 14 mm. the versys solid reamers and rasps were used incrementally through size 14. the last was rotationally stable. imaging confirmed appropriate fit and fill and axial alignment. the rasp was removed with pulsatile jet lavage. a size 14 epic stem was inserted into the second incision while viewed through the anterior incision. it was fully impacted in place where it was stable. trial reduction was satisfactorily performed with a minus 3.5-mm neck and 32-mm head. equality of limb length and stability of the hip were confirmed. the hip was dislocated for replacement of the trial head with a comparable definitive metallic head by impaction with the **name[uuu] taper. final reduction was performed. hard copy images were obtained. pulsatile jet lavage was completed. a small hemovac drain was inserted. the deep fascia was closed with interrupted 0 vicryl. the subcutaneous layers and skin were closed with resorbable sutures in conventional fashion. steri-strips, dry, and opsite dressings were added. the patient tolerated the procedure well, and was transferred to the recovery room in good condition.


#Question#: Why did the surgeon use a 10-degree anterior wall elevated polyethylene liner?
#Answer#: To provide additional stability to the hip joint

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.

#Question#: What is the chief complaint of the patient?
#Answer#: Diverticulitis

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:


#Sentence#: <first sentence in the answer>
#Context passage#: <the relevant passage, or None if not found>
#Hallucinated#: <Yes if there is a contradiction or if no relevant passage is found, No otherwise>
#Reasoning#: <Explain why/why not there is a hallucination>

#Sentence#: <second sentence in the answer>
#Context passage#: <the relevant passage, or None if not found>
#Hallucinated#: <Yes if there is a contradiction or if no relevant passage is found, No otherwise>
#Reasoning#: <Explain why/why not there is a hallucination>

<More sentences>

#Coherent with the question#: <Yes if the answer responds to the question, No otherwise>

#Verdict#: <Yes if you have found any hallucination, No otherwise>

#Question#: How was the patient's sodium level during admission?
#Answer#: 136

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:


#Sentence#: <first sentence in the answer>
#Context passage#: <the relevant passage, or None if not found>
#Hallucinated#: <Yes if there is a contradiction or if no relevant passage is found, No otherwise>

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

VERDICT 1.0
>> #Sentence#: The patient was taking docusate sodium for constipation before admission.
#Context passage#: None
#Hallucinated#: Yes
#Reasoning#: There is no mention of the patient taking docusate sodium in the given context, which would mean the information is hallucinated. 

#Sentence#: The patient needs to have another chest x-ray within 1 to 2 days after her discharge to evaluate the progression of the pleural effusion and the worsening of the infiltrate.
#Context passage#: The patient had a chest x-ray during hospitalization that showed unilateral pleural effusion. Thoracentesis was performed, which showed an exudate without signs of malignancy on the cytological examination. It is noted that this fluid had a high content of lymphocytes up to 81% and a low neutrophil count with 5% of the total WBCs. This is an unusual finding for a parapneumonic effusion. We also checked another chest x-ray to ensure that the effusion was not progressing or infiltrates at the same time. At this time, she is afebrile, hemodynamically stable with a WBC count within normal limits and being discharged.
#Hallucinated#: No
#Reasoning#: The context does mention that another chest x-ray should be performed after discharge to evaluate the progression of the pleural effusion and the worsening of the infiltrate. This information is coherent with the answer provided.

#Question#: What is the plan for the patient's fracture?
#Answer#: physical therapy and medication regimen

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:

on coumadin, who presented to the hospital with left-sided chest pain. as per the patient, her pain began two years back. it is pleuritic in nature. the pain is an 8/10 in intensity. it is persistent in timing. it is exacerbated by taking a deep breath or coughing, and there are no relieving factors. the pain does not radiate to the arms or the jaw. the pain is not associated with perspiration or

40s]-year-old patient with a history of multiple pulmonary embolisms due to hypercoagulable state because of factor v leiden mutation. this was diagnosed apparently in 2000 following an episode of pulmonary embolism. she has been on coumadin on and off. she is known to have a history of being noncompliant with coumadin. in the ed, she was hemodynamically stable, but given the fact that she has issues with compliance, we were concerned about the possibility of a pulmonary embolism because of under-anticoagulation. we checked her inr and it was 1.1. we obtained a ct scan of the chest with iv dye using the pe protocol. the scan was adequate and did not show any evidence of pulmonary embolism. i discussed the clinical picture of the patient with dr. **name[ttt rrr] who has seen the patient in the past with the resident. dr. **name[rrr] apparently knows the patient very well and tells me that the patient has had multiple scans in the last few years where the preliminary read was that the patient might have a pulmonary embolism, and she had been diagnosed with factor v leiden mutation at a different hospital. she did have her factor v leiden mutation checked in our hospital recently, and it was normal. she was homozygous for the mutation. as per dr. **name[rrr]'s opinion, the patient does not have factor v leiden mutation, and all of her ct scans that have been done in the **institution system have been negative for pulmonary embolism. she did tell me that the medicine team was planning to take her off her anticoagulation and repeat the whole battery of hypercoagulable state. she does have an appointment with dr. **name[qqq ppp] on **date[apr 03] at 3:20 p.m. dr. **name[rrr] was comfortable with us sending the patient home if we did not think that the patient was in any sort of hemodynamic compromise. she was planning to repeat the whole battery tomorrow when the patient is in the clinic. i discussed the case, and in my discussion with dr. **name[zzz], who was the supervising attending, he agreed with the patient going home. the patient did not have any fevers. she is not tachypneic. she is not having tachycardia. her chest pain started after she started having a cough. her x-ray did not show any infiltrates or any pneumothorax. she had a ct scan on which there was no airspace disease. the patient will be discharged on ibuprofen 400 mg q. 6 hours for pain control and will be given five vicodin to be used for the breakthrough pain. she has also been given robitussin-cf to be used three times a day to help with the congestion. she has been advised to follow up with dr. **name[rrr] and dr. **name[ppp] tomorrow at 3:20 p.m. in the department of medicine. the patient did understand all of this and was very cooperative. she was advised that if she has further chest pain which is not getting better, if she has increasing shortness of breath or if she is having fevers with chills, she should come back to the ed or call an ambulance. this cased was supervised by dr. **name[zzz], and he was in agreement with the plan.

#Answer#: diabetes, hypertension

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:


#Sentence#: <first sentence in the answer>

#Question#: What is recommended for the patient's medications after scope?
#Answer#: reevaluate recommendations

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:

best that he has been in our **institution database, he is stage iv ckd and should begin education as the natural history of chronic kidney disease is progression. thank you so much for allowing us to

You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:


#Sentence#: <first sentence in the answer>
#Context passage#: <the relevant passage, or None if not found>
#Hallucinated#: <Yes if there is a contradiction or if no relevant passage is found, No otherwise>
#Reasoning#: <Explain why/why not there is a hallucination>

#Sentence#: <second sentence in the answer>
#Context passage#: <the relevant passage, or None if not found>
#Hallucinated#: <Yes if there is a contradiction or if no relevant passage is found, No otherwise>
#Reasoning#: <Explain why/why not there is a hallucination>

<More sentences>

#Coherent with the question#: <Yes if the answer responds to the question, No otherwise>

#Verdict#: <Yes if you have found any hallucination, No otherwise>

>> #Sentence#: 1. acute on chronic renal failure versus progression of his underlying stage iv ckd and i suspect it is the latter.
#Context passage#: "on the thirteenth bun 47 and creatinine 2.6. on **date[feb 25 04] bun 35 and creatinine 2.4."
#Hallucinated#: No
#Reasoning#: The context shows that the patient's renal function has been worsening over time, which supports the suspicion of progression of stage iv ckd rather than acute on chronic renal failure.

#Sentence#: a) check urine studies.
#Context passage#: None
#Hallucinated#: No
#Reasoning#: Although not mentioned in the context, it is a reasonable recommendation to check urine studies for someone with kidney issues.

#Sentence#: b) check renal ultrasound with postvoid residuals to rule out easily reversible causes of renal failure such as urinary retention and obstruction.
#Context passage: None

#Question#: Why did the doctor think further inpatient treatment was necessary for the patient?
#Answer#: to treat her urinary tract infection

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

chest pain and cough expectoration. history of present illness: this is a **age[in 40s]-year-old lady with a past medical history of hypercoagulable state and multiple pulmonary embolisms, chronically on coumadin, who presented to the hospital with left-sided chest pain. as per the patient, her pain began two years back. it is pleuritic in nature. the pain is an 8/10 in intensity. it is persistent in timing. it is exacerbated by taking a deep breath or coughing, and there are no relieving factors. the pain does not radiate to the arms or the jaw. the pain is not associated with perspiration or nausea. she also is giving a history of having a cough with yellowish to greenish-colored expectoration. the expectoration is minimal in amount. she has not seen blood in the expectorant. she denies any fevers or chills. she denies any sick contacts. review of systems: she denies any nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea. she denies any abdominal pain. she denies any swelling of her

low back pain. allergies: morphine which gives her hives. medications: she is on coumadin 5 mg q.p.m. for the last two days. before that, she was taking 7.5 mg. she has been managing her coumadin herself. because of lack of insurance, she is not able to go to the **institution. social history: she has been a smoker in the past but apparently has decreased that recently. she denies alcohol, drugs or tattoos. she is currently separated. family history: her mother had bladder cancer. her mother also had coronary artery disease and diabetes. her father had lung cancer. physical exam:

40s]-year-old patient with a history of multiple pulmonary embolisms due to hypercoagulable state because of factor v leiden mutation. this was diagnosed apparently in 2000 following an episode of pulmonary embolism. she has been on coumadin on and off. she is known to have a history of being noncompliant with coumadin. in the ed, she was hemodynamically stable, but given the fact that she has issues with compliance, we were concerned about the possibility of a pulmonary embolism because of under-anticoagulation. we checked her inr and it was 1.1. we obtained a ct scan of the chest with iv dye using the pe protocol. the scan was adequate and did not show any evidence of pulmonary embolism. i discussed the clinical picture of the patient with dr. **name[ttt rrr] who has seen the patient in the past with the resident. dr. **name[rrr] apparently knows the patient very well and tells me that the patient has had multiple scans in the last few years where the preliminary read was that the patient might have a pulmonary embolism, and she had been diagnosed with factor v leiden mutation at a different hospital. she did have her factor v leiden mutation checked in our hospital recently, and it was normal. she was homozygous for the mutation. as per dr. **name[rrr]'s opinion, the patient does not have factor v leiden mutation, and all of her ct scans that have been done in the **institution system have been negative for pulmonary embolism. she did tell me that the medicine team was planning to take her off her anticoagulation and repeat the whole battery of hypercoagulable state. she does have an appointment with dr. **name[qqq ppp] on **date[apr 03] at 3:20 p.m. dr. **name[rrr] was comfortable with us sending the patient home if we did not think that the patient was in any sort of hemodynamic compromise. she was planning to repeat the whole battery tomorrow when the patient is in the clinic. i discussed the case, and in my discussion with dr. **name[zzz], who was the supervising attending, he agreed with the patient going home. the patient did not have any fevers. she is not tachypneic. she is not having tachycardia. her chest pain started after she started having a cough. her x-ray did not show any infiltrates or any pneumothorax. she had a ct scan on which there was no airspace disease. the patient will be discharged on ibuprofen 400 mg q. 6 hours for pain control and will be given five vicodin to be used for the breakthrough pain. she has also been given robitussin-cf to be used three times a day to help with the congestion. she has been advised to follow up with dr. **name[rrr] and dr. **name[ppp] tomorrow at 3:20 p.m. in the department of medicine. the patient did understand all of this and was very cooperative. she was advised that if she has further chest pain which is not getting better, if she has increasing shortness of breath or if she is having fevers with chills, she should come back to the ed or call an ambulance. this cased was supervised by dr. **name[zzz], and he was in agreement with the plan.

Young people today are facing many challenges, including mental health issues, substance abuse, and academic stress. As a result, they need support from their peers, families, and communities. One way to provide that support is through the use of technology. A co-created system (CoCIS) can be designed using existing technology to help young people navigate these challenges. The CoCIS would be developed by a group of young people with input from mental health professionals, educators, and community members. It would include resources and tools for self-care, coping skills, and access to support services. This system could be accessed through a mobile app or website and would provide a safe space for young people to connect with each other and seek help when needed. By providing this type of support system, we can better address the needs of our youth and help them navigate the challenges they face today.

#Answer#: yes

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:


#Sentence#: <first sentence in the answer>
#Context passage#: <the relevant passage, or None if not found>
#Hallucinated#: <Yes if there is a contradiction or if no relevant passage is found, No otherwise>

Report Text: **institution operative report name: **name[aaa, bbb] acct #: **id-num mrn: **id-num date of procedure: **date[mar 24 2006] admitted: **date[mar 24 2007] surgeon: **name[yyy zzz], md diagnosis: degenerative arthritis, right hip. procedure: right minimally invasive total hip replacement under spinal anesthesia, image intensification. assistant: **name[xxx www], pa-c history: for several years this woman has experienced insidious onset and progression of pain in her right hip that became incapacitating despite conservative treatment. recent clinical and radiographic features were consistent with severe degenerative arthritis of the right hip. recommendation was made for right minimally invasive total hip replacement. the risks, complications, and therapeutic options were reviewed. the patient was agreeable to proceed. technique: the patient was draped and prepped in usual sterile fashion under spinal anesthesia. she was placed supine with an inflatable pad elevated under her right hip. with image intensification, the site for an oblique 5-cm incision anterior to the intertrochanteric ridge of the right proximal femur was identified. the incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia. a few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized. curved scissors was used to bluntly develop the interval between tensor and sartorius down to the underlying hip capsule. the traversing lateral circumflex vessels were identified, clamped, cauterized, and divided. the hip capsule was incised with the electrocautery along the axis of the femoral neck with supplementary releases around the acetabular rim, and along the intertrochanteric ridge. hip retractors were placed deep to the capsule. observation confirmed features of severe degenerative arthritis of the femoral head with complete erosion of articular cartilage and osteophytes. with image intensification, the site for a standard osteotomy of the proximal femur was identified. the osteotomy was completed with a reciprocal saw, along with a parallel cut through the equator of the femoral head. the neck fragment was impaled with a schanz screw to extract it. the head fragment was grasped with a bone clamp to remove it. the labrum was sharply excised. the acetabulum was debrided with curettes and rongeurs. periodically, profuse antibiotic irrigation with jet lavage was performed. the acetabulum was reamed incrementally with hemispherical reamers through size 54 mm. with imaging, a **name[vvv] trabecular metal shell of 54 mm was selected. the shell was inserted into the acetabulum on the aligning tool and impacted. supplementary anchorage was achieved with 2 of the 6.5 mm cancellous screws inserted into 3.2-mm drill holes with the use of a depth gauge. solid fixation of the shell was documented. a 10-degree anterior wall elevated polyethylene liner was impacted into the metal backing. attention was turned to the proximal femur. initially, the contralateral left hip was hyperextended by adjustment of the jupiter table. the right lower extremity was placed in the figure-of-four position. a box chisel was used on the osteotomized femoral neck. a 1 cm square of capsule was sharply excised from the lateral aspect of the neck. curved scissors was used to incise the capsule above the neck. lines were drawn on the thigh to identify the site for the second 3-cm incision high in the lateral aspect of the hip. the incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia. a few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized. curved scissors were used to bluntly develop a tunnel through gluteus maximus into the hip joint. the 3 sizers of hip dilator were used to enlarge the tunnel. a pointed awl was used to impale the osteotomized femoral neck. a ball-ended guidewire was passed down the femoral canal for flexible reaming incrementally through 14 mm. the versys solid reamers and rasps were used incrementally through size 14. the last was rotationally stable. imaging confirmed appropriate fit and fill and axial alignment. the rasp was removed with pulsatile jet lavage. a size 14 epic stem was inserted into the second incision while viewed through the anterior incision. it was fully impacted in place where it was stable. trial reduction was satisfactorily performed with a minus 3.5-mm neck and 32-mm head. equality of limb length and stability of the hip were confirmed. the hip was dislocated for replacement of the trial head with a comparable definitive metallic head by impaction with the **name[uuu] taper. final reduction was performed. hard copy images were obtained. pulsatile jet lavage was completed. a small hemovac drain was inserted. the deep fascia was closed with interrupted 0 vicryl. the subcutaneous layers and skin were closed with resorbable sutures in conventional fashion. steri-strips, dry, and opsite dressings were added. the patient tolerated the procedure well, and was transferred to the recovery room in good condition.

You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:


#Sentence#: <first sentence in the answer>
#Context passage#: <the relevant passage, or None if not found>
#Hallucinated#: <Yes if there is a contradiction or if no relevant passage is found, No otherwise>
#Reasoning#: <Explain why/why not there is a hallucination>

#Sentence#: <second sentence in the answer>
#Context passage#: <the relevant passage, or None if not found>
#Hallucinated#: <Yes if there is a contradiction or if no relevant passage is found, No otherwise>
#Reasoning#: <Explain why/why not there is a hallucination>

#Question#: Who was responsible for following up with the patient after her discharge?
#Answer#: Dr. ABC at a private practice

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:


#Sentence#: <first sentence in the answer>
#Context passage#: <the relevant passage, or None if not found>
#Hallucinated#: <Yes if there is a contradiction or if no relevant passage is found, No otherwise>
#Reasoning#: <Explain why/why not there is a hallucination>

#Sentence#: <second sentence in the answer>
#Context passage#: <the relevant passage, or None if not found>
#Hallucinated#: <Yes if there is a contradiction or if no relevant passage is found, No otherwise>
#Reasoning#: <Explain why/why not there is a hallucination>

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

>> #Sentence#: closed fracture of metacarpal bone(s), site unspecified
#Context passage#: films obtained for this right-hand pain revealed a fracture of the right fifth metacarpal.
#Hallucinated#: Yes
#Reasoning#: The context specifies the fracture is on the 5th metacarpal while the answer only says 'metacarpal bone(s)'. However, it's generally correct that there's a closed fracture of a metacarpal bone.

#Sentence#: open wound of forehead, without mention of complication
#Context passage#: 4-cm laceration above the right eye which was treated by plastic surgery resident as well as a right hand injury.
#Hallucinated#: No
#Reasoning#: The context describes a 4-cm laceration above the right eye, which is consistent with an open wound on the forehead.

#Sentence#: diabetes mellitus without mention of complication, type ii or unspecified type, not stated as uncontrolled
#Context passage#: medical history includes... 2. noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
#Hallucinated#: No
#Reasoning#: The context states the patient has a history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, which is consistent with type II diabetes. It does not mention whether it's controlled or uncontrolled, which aligns with the answer.

VERDICT 0.0
>> #Sentence#: closed fracture of metacarpal bone(s), site unspecified
#Context passage#: films obtained for this right-hand pain revealed a fracture of the right fifth metacarpal.
#Hallucinated#: Yes
#Reasoning#: The context passage mentions that there is a specific fracture of the right fifth metacarpal, but the answer states it as "closed fracture of metacarpal bone(s), site unspecified". This difference between the answer and the context passage indicates a hallucination.

#Sentence#: open wound of forehead, without mention of complication
#Context passage#: 4-cm laceration above the right eye which was treated by plastic surgery resident as well as a right hand injury.
#Hallucinated#: No
#Reasoning#: The answer describes an "open wound of forehead" while the context passage mentions a "4-cm laceration above the right eye", both conveying similar information about a head injury, but they are not identical. However, this is not a hallucination as the answer could be referring to the same wound as described in the context passage.

#Sentence#: diabetes mellitus without mention of complication, site unspecified
#Context passage#: none found
#Hallucinated#: Yes
#Reasoning#: There is no passage in the context that mentions "diabetes mellitus" or any information about a potential diabetes diagnosis. This absence of information suggests a hallucination in the answer.

#Sentence#: extent of right hand injury
#Context passage#: films obtained for this right-hand pain revealed a fracture of the right fifth metacarpal. 4-cm laceration above the right eye which was treated by plastic surgery resident as well as a right hand injury.
#Hallucinated#: No
#Reasoning#: The answer asks about the extent of the patient's right hand injury, and the context passage provides information about both the fracture in the fifth metacarpal and other right-hand injuries. This contextual information is relevant to answering the question.

Report Text: **institution operative report name: **name[aaa, bbb] acct #: **id-num mrn: **id-num date of procedure: **date[mar 24 2006] admitted: **date[mar 24 2007] surgeon: **name[yyy zzz], md diagnosis: degenerative arthritis, right hip. procedure: right minimally invasive total hip replacement under spinal anesthesia, image intensification. assistant: **name[xxx www], pa-c history: for several years this woman has experienced insidious onset and progression of pain in her right hip that became incapacitating despite conservative treatment. recent clinical and radiographic features were consistent with severe degenerative arthritis of the right hip. recommendation was made for right minimally invasive total hip replacement. the risks, complications, and therapeutic options were reviewed. the patient was agreeable to proceed. technique: the patient was draped and prepped in usual sterile fashion under spinal anesthesia. she was placed supine with an inflatable pad elevated under her right hip. with image intensification, the site for an oblique 5-cm incision anterior to the intertrochanteric ridge of the right proximal femur was identified. the incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia. a few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized. curved scissors was used to bluntly develop the interval between tensor and sartorius down to the underlying hip capsule. the traversing lateral circumflex vessels were identified, clamped, cauterized, and divided. the hip capsule was incised with the electrocautery along the axis of the femoral neck with supplementary releases around the acetabular rim, and along the intertrochanteric ridge. hip retractors were placed deep to the capsule. observation confirmed features of severe degenerative arthritis of the femoral head with complete erosion of articular cartilage and osteophytes. with image intensification, the site for a standard osteotomy of the proximal femur was identified. the osteotomy was completed with a reciprocal saw, along with a parallel cut through the equator of the femoral head. the neck fragment was impaled with a schanz screw to extract it. the head fragment was grasped with a bone clamp to remove it. the labrum was sharply excised. the acetabulum was debrided with curettes and rongeurs. periodically, profuse antibiotic irrigation with jet lavage was performed. the acetabulum was reamed incrementally with hemispherical reamers through size 54 mm. with imaging, a **name[vvv] trabecular metal shell of 54 mm was selected. the shell was inserted into the acetabulum on the aligning tool and impacted. supplementary anchorage was achieved with 2 of the 6.5 mm cancellous screws inserted into 3.2-mm drill holes with the use of a depth gauge. solid fixation of the shell was documented. a 10-degree anterior wall elevated polyethylene liner was impacted into the metal backing. attention was turned to the proximal femur. initially, the contralateral left hip was hyperextended by adjustment of the jupiter table. the right lower extremity was placed in the figure-of-four position. a box chisel was used on the osteotomized femoral neck. a 1 cm square of capsule was sharply excised from the lateral aspect of the neck. curved scissors was used to incise the capsule above the neck. lines were drawn on the thigh to identify the site for the second 3-cm incision high in the lateral aspect of the hip. the incision was extended sharply through the subcutaneous fat and deep fascia. a few small subcutaneous bleeding points were clamped and cauterized. curved scissors were used to bluntly develop a tunnel through gluteus maximus into the hip joint. the 3 sizers of hip dilator were used to enlarge the tunnel. a pointed awl was used to impale the osteotomized femoral neck. a ball-ended guidewire was passed down the femoral canal for flexible reaming incrementally through 14 mm. the versys solid reamers and rasps were used incrementally through size 14. the last was rotationally stable. imaging confirmed appropriate fit and fill and axial alignment. the rasp was removed with pulsatile jet lavage. a size 14 epic stem was inserted into the second incision while viewed through the anterior incision. it was fully impacted in place where it was stable. trial reduction was satisfactorily performed with a minus 3.5-mm neck and 32-mm head. equality of limb length and stability of the hip were confirmed. the hip was dislocated for replacement of the trial head with a comparable definitive metallic head by impaction with the **name[uuu] taper. final reduction was performed. hard copy images were obtained. pulsatile jet lavage was completed. a small hemovac drain was inserted. the deep fascia was closed with interrupted 0 vicryl. the subcutaneous layers and skin were closed with resorbable sutures in conventional fashion. steri-strips, dry, and opsite dressings were added. the patient tolerated the procedure well, and was transferred to the recovery room in good condition.

#Context passage#: He has a history of diverticulitis in the past.
#Hallucinated#: Yes
#Reasoning#: The context mentions a history of diverticulitis, not diverticulosis. These two conditions are different; diverticulosis refers to the presence of diverticula without any symptoms or complications, while diverticulitis is an inflammation or infection in one or more diverticula. The answer is hallucinated as it does not accurately represent the patient's medical history based on the provided context.

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:

#Question#: What is the patient's laboratory data showing?
#Answer#: Bun 39, creatinine 2.9, calcium 8.3, albumin 3.7, phosphorus 3, magnesium 1.8

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

You will split the ANSWER into sentences. For each sentence in the ANSWER, you will apply the following process:
1. Copy the sentence.
2. Contrast the sentence with the provided context:
    - If you find a passage in the context that conveys the same information as the sentence, copy that passage.
    - Otherwise, if you find a passage that contradicts the sentence, copy that passage and explain how it is contradictory.
    - If there is no passage in the context that conveys the information in the sentence, highlight it.
3. If at some point you find a contradiction or some missing information, you have found a hallucination. You can stop looking through the answer's sentences. Skip to the final step.

If every sentence conveys information that is present in the context and there are no contradictions, you will finally check if the given answer is relevant to the question. If it does not answer the question, you have found a hallucination.

Based on all your reasoning, does the given answer contain ANY hallucinations or non-factual information? Answer 'Yes' or 'No' on a separate line. Do not judge whether the hallucination was intentional or its severity.
Use the following format in your response:


#Sentence#: <first sentence in the answer>
#Context passage#: <the relevant passage, or None if not found>
#Hallucinated#: <Yes if there is a contradiction or if no relevant passage is found, No otherwise>
#Reasoning#: <Explain why/why not there is a hallucination>

#Sentence#: <second sentence in the answer>
#Context passage#: <the relevant passage, or None if not found>
#Hallucinated#: <Yes if there is a contradiction or if no relevant passage is found, No otherwise>
#Reasoning#: <Explain why/why not there is a hallucination>

<More sentences>

#Coherent with the question#: <Yes if the answer responds to the question, No otherwise>

#Verdict#: <Yes if you have found any hallucination, No otherwise>
