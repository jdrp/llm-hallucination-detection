PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Myelofibrosis is a disorder of the bone marrow in which the marrow is replaced by fibrous scar tissue.
Causes
Bone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside your bones. Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow that develop into all of your blood cells. Your blood is made of:
Red blood cells (which carry oxygen to your tissues)
White blood cells (which fight infection)
Platelets (which help your blood clot)
When the bone marrow is scarred, it cannot make enough blood cells.
Anemia
, bleeding problems, and a higher risk for infections may occur.
As a result, the liver and spleen try to make some of these blood cells. This causes these organs to swell.
The cause of myelofibrosis is often unknown. There are no known risk factors. When it occurs, it often develops slowly in people over age 50. Women and men are equally affected. There is an increased occurrence of this condition in Ashkenazi Jews.
Blood and bone marrow cancers, such as myelodysplastic syndrome,
leukemia
, and lymphoma, may also cause bone marrow scarring. This is called secondary myelofibrosis.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Abdominal fullness
, pain, or feeling full before finishing a meal (because ofÂ an enlarged spleen)
Bone pain
Easy bleeding,
bruising
Fatigue
Increased likelihood of getting an infection
Pale skin
Shortness of breath
with exercise
Weight loss
Night sweats
Low grade fever
Enlarged liver
Dry cough
Itchy skin
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.
Tests that may be done include:
Complete blood count
(CBC) with blood smear to check different types of blood cells
Measuring tissue damage (
LDH enzyme level
)
Molecular testing
Bone marrow biopsy
to diagnose the condition and to check for bone marrow cancers
Treatment
Bone marrow
or stem cell transplant may improve symptoms, and may cure the disease. This treatment is usually considered for younger people.
Other treatment may involve:
Blood transfusions and medicines to correct anemia
Radiation and
chemotherapy
Targeted medicines
Removal of the spleen (
splenectomy
) if swelling causes symptoms, or to help with anemia
Outlook (Prognosis)
As the disease worsens, the bone marrow slowly stops working. Low platelet count leads to easy bleeding. Spleen swelling may get worse along with anemia.
Survival of people with primary myelofibrosis is about 5 years. But some people survive for decades.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Development of
acute myelogenous leukemia
Infections
Bleeding
Blood clots
Liver failure
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Make an appointment with your provider if you have symptoms of this disorder. Seek medical care right away for uncontrolled bleeding, shortness of breath, or jaundice (yellow skin and whites of the eyes) that gets worse.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Shin splints occur when you have pain in the front of your lower leg. The pain of shin splints is from the inflammation of the muscles, tendons, and bone tissue around your shin. Shin splints are a common problem for runners, gymnasts, dancers, and military recruits. However, there are things you can do to heal from shin splints and prevent them from getting worse.
Causes
Shin splints are an overuse problem. You get shin splints from overloading your leg muscles, tendons or shin bone.
Most often, the activity that causes the injury is high impact and repetitive exercise of your lower legs. This is why runners, dancers, and gymnasts often get shin splints. Common situations that cause shin splints are:
Sudden change in activity level, whether it is in intensity or duration
Running, especially on hills. If you are a new runner, you are at greater risk for shin splints.
Increasing your days of training.
Increasing the intensity of training, or going a longer distance.
Doing exercise that has frequent stops and starts, such as dancing, basketball, or military training.
You are more at risk for shin splints if you:
Have flat feet or very rigid foot arches.
Work out on hard surfaces, such as running on the street or playing basketball or tennis on a hard court.
Do not wear the proper shoes.
Wear worn out shoes. Running shoes lose over half of their shock absorbing ability after 250 miles (400 kilometers) of use.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Pain in one or both legs
Sharp or dull, aching pain in the front of your shin
Pain when you push on your shins
Pain that gets worse during and after exercise
Pain that gets better with rest
If you have severe shin splints, your legs may hurt even when you are not walking.
Decrease Your Activity
Expect that you need at least 2 to 4 weeks of rest from your sport or exercise.
Avoid repetitive exercise of your lower leg for 1 to 2 weeks. Keep your activity to just the walking that you do during your regular day.
Try other low impact activities as long as you do not have pain, such as swimming, elliptical machine, or biking.
After 2 to 4 weeks, if the pain is gone, you can start your usual exercise activities. Increase your activity level slowly. If the pain returns, stop exercising right away.
Know that shin splints can take 3 to 6 months to heal completely. Do not rush back into your sport or exercise. You could injure yourself again.
Reduce Your Pain and Swelling
Things you can do to ease discomfort include:
Ice your shins. Ice several times a day for 3 days or until pain is gone.
Do stretching exercises, especially over the front part of the shin.
Take ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin to decrease swelling and to help with pain. Know these medicines have side effects and can cause ulcers and bleeding. Talk to your health care provider about how much you can take.
Use arch supports. Talk with your provider or physical therapist about wearing the proper shoes, and about special shock-absorbing insoles or orthotics to wear inside your shoes.
Work with a physical therapist. They can use therapies that may help with the pain. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your leg muscles.
How to Prevent Shin Splints
To prevent shin splints from recurring:
Be pain-free for at least 2 weeks before returning to your exercise routine.
Do not overdo your exercise routine. Do not return to your previous level of intensity. Go slower, for a shorter time. Increase your training slowly.
Warm up and stretch before and after exercise.
Ice your shins after exercise to decrease swelling.
Avoid hard surfaces.
Wear proper shoes with good support and padding.
Consider changing the surface that you train on.
Cross train and add in low impact exercise, such as swimming or biking.
When to Call the Doctor
Shin splints are most often not serious. Call your provider if:
You have pain after several weeks even with rest, icing, and pain relievers.
You are not sure whether your pain is caused by shin splints.
Swelling in your lower legs is getting worse.
Your shin is red and feels hot to the touch.
Your provider may take an x-ray or perform other tests to make sure you do not have a stress fracture. You will also be checked to make sure you do not have another shin problem, such as tendonitis or compartment syndrome.

>> #Context#: Night blindness is poor vision at night or in dim light.
Considerations
Night blindness may cause problems with driving at night. People with night blindness often have trouble seeing stars on a clear night or walking through a dark room, such as a movie theater.
These problems are often worse just after a person is in a brightly lit environment. Milder cases may just have a harder time adapting to darkness.
Causes
The causes of night blindness fall into 2 categories: treatable and nontreatable.
Treatable causes:
Cataracts
Nearsightedness
Use of certain drugs
Vitamin A deficiency
(rare)
Nontreatable causes:
Birth defects, particularly congenital stationary night blindness
Retinitis pigmentosa
Home Care
Take safety measures to prevent accidents in areas of low light. Avoid driving a car at night, unless you get your eye doctor's approval.
Vitamin A supplements may be helpful if you have a vitamin A deficiency. Ask your health care provider how much you should take, because it is possible to take too much.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
It is important to have a complete eye exam to determine the cause, which may be treatable. Contact your eye doctor if symptoms of night blindness persist or significantly affect your life.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will examine you and your eyes. The goal of the medical exam is to determine if the problem can be corrected (for example, with new glasses or
cataract removal
), or if the problem is due to something that is not treatable.
The provider may ask you questions, including:
How severe is the night blindness?
When did your symptoms start?
Did it occur suddenly or gradually?
Does it happen all the time?
Does using corrective lenses improve night vision?
Have you ever had eye surgery?
What medicines do you use?
How is your diet?
Have you recently injured your eyes or head?
Do you have a family history of
diabetes
?
Do you have other vision changes?
What other symptoms do you have?
Do you have unusual stress, anxiety, or a fear of the dark?
The eye exam will include:
Color vision testing
Pupil light reflex
Refraction
Retinal exam
Slit lamp examination
Visual acuity
Other tests may be done:
Electroretinogram
(ERG)
Visual field

>> #Context#: Von Gierke disease is a condition in which the body cannot break down glycogen. Glycogen is a form of sugar (glucose) that is stored in the liver and muscles. It is normally broken down into glucose to give you more energy when you need it.
Von Gierke disease is also called Type I glycogen storage disease (GSD I).
Causes
Von Gierke disease occurs when the body lacks the protein (enzyme) that releases glucose from glycogen. This causes abnormal amounts of glycogen to build up in certain tissues. When glycogen is not broken down properly, it leads to
low blood sugar
.
Von Gierke disease is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease.
Symptoms
These are symptoms of von Gierke disease:
Constant hunger and need to eat often
Easy bruising and nosebleeds
Fatigue
Irritability
Puffy cheeks, thin chest and limbs, and swollen belly
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam.
The exam may show signs of:
Delayed puberty
Enlarged liver
Gout
Inflammatory bowel disease
Liver tumors
Severe low blood sugar
Stunted growth or failure to grow
Children with this condition are usually diagnosed before age 1 year.
Tests that may be done include:
Biopsy of liver
or kidney
Blood sugar test
Genetic testing
Lactic acid blood test
Triglyceride level
Uric acid blood test
If a person has this disease, test results will show low blood sugar and high levels of lactate (produced from lactic acid), blood fats (lipids), and uric acid.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to avoid low blood sugar. Eat frequently during the day, especially foods that contain carbohydrates (starches). Older children and adults may take cornstarch by mouth to increase their carbohydrate intake.
In some children, a feeding tube is placed through their nose into the stomach throughout the night to provide sugars or uncooked cornstarch. The tube can be taken out each morning. Alternatively, a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) can be placed to deliver food directly to the stomach overnight.
A medicine to lower uric acid in the blood and decrease the risk for gout may be prescribed. Your provider may also prescribe medicines to treat kidney disease, high lipids, and to increase the cells that fight infection.
People with von Gierke disease cannot properly break down fruit or milk sugar. It is best to avoid these products.
Support Groups
More information and support for people with von Gierke disease and their families can be found at:
Association for Glycogen Storage Disease --
www.agsdus.org
Outlook (Prognosis)
With treatment, growth, puberty, and quality of life have improved for people with von Gierke disease. Those who are identified and carefully treated at a young age can live into adulthood.
Early treatment also decreases the rate of severe problems such as:
Gout
Kidney failure
Life-threatening low blood sugar
Liver tumors
Possible Complications
These complications can occur:
Frequent infection
Gout
Kidney failure
Liver tumors
Osteoporosis
(thinning bones)
Seizures
,
lethargy
, confusion due to low blood sugar
Short height
Underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics (breasts, pubic hair)
Ulcers of the mouth
or bowel
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have a family history of glycogen storage disease or early infant death due to low blood sugar.
Prevention
There is no simple way to prevent glycogen storage disease.
Couples who wish to have a baby may seek genetic counseling and testing to determine their risk for passing on von Gierke disease.

>> #Context#: Clubfoot is a condition that involves both the foot and lower leg in which the foot turns inward and downward. It is a congenital condition, which means it is present at birth.
Causes
Clubfoot is the most common congenital disorder of the legs. It can range from mild and flexible to severe and rigid.
The cause is not known. Most often, it occurs by itself. But the condition may be passed down through families in some cases. Risk factors include a family history of the disorder and being male. Clubfoot can also occur as part of an underlying genetic syndrome, such as
trisomy 18
.
A related problem, called positional clubfoot, is not true clubfoot. It results from a normal foot positioned abnormally while the baby is in the womb. This problem is easily corrected after birth.
Symptoms
The physical appearance of the foot may vary. One or both feet may be affected.
The foot turns inward and downward at birth and is difficult to place in the correct position. The calf muscle and foot may be slightly smaller than normal.
Exams and Tests
The disorder is identified during a physical examination.
A foot x-ray may be done. Ultrasound during the first 6 months of pregnancy can also help to identify the disorder.
Treatment
Treatment may involve moving the foot into the correct position and using a cast to keep it there. This is often done by an orthopedic specialist. Treatment should be started as early as possible, ideally, shortly after birth, when it is easiest to reshape the foot.
Gentle stretching and recasting will be done every week to improve the position of the foot. Generally, 5 to 10 casts are needed. The final cast will stay in place for 3 weeks. After the foot is in the correct position, the child will wear a special brace nearly full time for 3 months. Then, the child will wear the brace at night for 3 to 5 years.
Often, the problem is a tightened Achilles tendon, and a simple procedure is needed to release it.
Some severe cases of clubfoot will need
surgery
if other treatments do not work, or if the problem returns. The child should be monitored by your health care provider until the foot is fully grown.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome is usually good with treatment.
Possible Complications
Some defects may not be completely fixed. However, treatment can improve the appearance and function of the foot. Treatment may be less successful if the clubfoot is linked to other birth disorders.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
If your child is being treated for clubfoot, contact your provider if:
The toes swell, bleed, or change color under the cast
The cast appears to be causing significant pain
The toes disappear into the cast
The cast slides off
The foot begins to turn in again after treatment

>> #Context#: Duodenal atresia is a condition in which the first part of the small bowel (the
duodenum
) has not developed properly. It is not open and does not allow the passage of stomach contents.
Causes
The cause of duodenal atresia is not known. It is thought to result from problems during an embryo's development. The duodenum does not change from a solid to a tube-like structure, as it normally would.
Many infants with duodenal atresia also have
Down syndrome
. Duodenal atresia is often associated with other birth defects.
Symptoms
Symptoms of duodenal atresia include:
Upper abdominal swelling (sometimes)
Early vomiting of large amounts, which may be greenish (containing
bile
)
Continued vomiting even when infant has not been fed for several hours
No bowel movements after first few meconium stools
Exams and Tests
A fetal ultrasound may show high amounts of
amniotic fluid
in the womb (
polyhydramnios
). It may also show swelling of the baby's stomach and part of the duodenum.
An
abdominal x-ray
may show air in the stomach and first part of duodenum, with no air beyond that. This is known as the double-bubble sign.
Treatment
A tube is placed to decompress the stomach. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances are corrected by providing fluids through an intravenous tube (IV, into a vein). Checking for other congenital anomalies should be done.
Surgery to correct the duodenal blockage is necessary, but not an emergency. The exact surgery will depend on the nature of the abnormality. Other problems (such as those related to Down syndrome) must be treated as appropriate.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Recovery from the duodenal atresia is expected after treatment. If not treated, the condition is deadly.
Possible Complications
These complications may occur:
Other birth defects
Dehydration
After surgery, there may be complications such as:
Swelling of the first part of the small bowel
Problems with movement through the intestines
Gastroesophageal reflux
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if your newborn is:
Feeding poorly or not at all
Vomiting (not simply spitting up) or if the vomit is green
Not urinating or having bowel movements
Prevention
There is no known prevention.

>> #Context#: Blount disease is a growth disorder of the shin bone (tibia) in which the lower leg turns inward, making it look like a bowleg.
Causes
Blount disease occurs in young children and adolescents. The cause is unknown. It is thought to be due to the effects of weight on the growth plate. The inner part of the shin bone, just below the knee, fails to develop normally.
Unlike
bowlegs
, which tend to straighten as the child develops, Blount disease slowly gets worse. It can cause severe bowing of one or both legs.
This condition is more common among African American children. It is also associated with obesity and early walking.
Symptoms
One or both of the lower legs turn inward. This is called "bowing." It may:
Look the same on both legs
Occur just below the knee
Rapidly get worse
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will examine you. This will show that the lower legs turn inward. An
x-ray of the knee
and the lower leg confirms the diagnosis.
Treatment
Braces are used to treat children who develop severe bowing before the age of 3.
Surgery is most often needed if bracesÂ do notÂ work, or if the problem is not diagnosed until the child is older. Surgery may involve cutting the shin bone to place it in the proper position. Sometimes, the bone will be lengthened as well.
Other times, surgery is done to restrict the growth of the outer half of the shin bone. This allows the child's natural growth to reverse the bowing process. This is a much smaller surgery. It works best in children with less severe symptoms who still have quite a bit of growing to do.
Outlook (Prognosis)
If the leg can be placed into the proper position, the outlook is good. The leg should work properly and look normal.
Possible Complications
Failure to treat Blount disease may lead to progressive deformity. The condition may lead to differences in leg lengths, which can result in disability if not treated.
Blount disease may come back after surgery, especially in younger children.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your child's provider if your child's leg or legs appear to be bowing. Also contact the provider if your child has bowed legs that appear to be getting worse.
Prevention
Weight loss may be helpful for overweight children.

>> #Context#: Balanitis is swelling of the foreskin and head of the
penis
.
Causes
Balanitis is most often caused by poor hygiene in uncircumcised men. Other possible causes include:
Diseases, such as
reactive arthritis
and lichen sclerosus atrophicus
Infection
Harsh soaps
Not rinsing soap off properly while bathing
Uncontrolled diabetes
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Redness of foreskin or penis
Other rashes on the head of the penis
Foul-smelling discharge
Painful penis and foreskin
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider may diagnose the problem with only an exam. However, you may need skin tests for viruses, fungi, or bacteria. A
skin biopsy
may also be needed. An exam by a dermatologist may be helpful.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the cause of the balanitis.
Antibiotic pills or creams are used to treat balanitis that is caused by bacteria.
Steroid creams may help balanitis that occurs with skin diseases.
Anti-fungal cream will be prescribed if it is due to a fungus.
In severe cases,
circumcision
may be the best option. If you cannot pull back (retract) the foreskin to clean it, you may need to be circumcised.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most cases of balanitis can be controlled with medicated creams and good hygiene. Surgery is not needed most of the time.
Possible Complications
Long-term swelling or infection can:
Scar and narrow the opening of the penis (meatal stricture)
Make it difficult and painful to retract the foreskin to expose the tip of the penis (a condition called phimosis)
Make it difficult to move the foreskin over the head of the penis (a condition called paraphimosis)
Affect the blood supply to the tip of the penis
Increase the risk of
penile cancer
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Tell your provider if you have any signs of balanitis, including swelling of the foreskin or pain.
Prevention
Good hygiene can prevent most cases of balanitis. When you bathe, pull back the foreskin to clean and dry the area under it.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare disease of the immune and nervous systems. It involves pale-colored hair, eyes, and skin.
Causes
Chediak-Higashi syndrome is passed down through families (inherited). It is an
autosomal recessive
disease. This means that both parents are carriers of a non-working copy of the gene. Each parent must pass their non-working gene to the child for them to show symptoms of the disease.
Defects have been found in the
LYST
(also called
CHS1
) gene. The primary defect in this disease is found in certain substances normally present in skin cells and certain white blood cells.
Symptoms
Children with this condition may have:
Silver hair, light-colored eyes (albinism)
Increased infections in the lungs, skin, and mucous membranes
Jerky eye movements (
nystagmus
)
Infection of affected children with certain viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (
EBV
), can cause a life-threatening illness resembling the blood cancer
lymphoma
called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
Other symptoms may include:
Decreased vision
Intellectual disability
Muscle weakness
Nerve problems in the limbs (
peripheral neuropathy
)
Nosebleeds or easy bruising
Numbness
Tremor
Seizures
Sensitivity to bright light (photophobia)
Unsteady walking (
ataxia
)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may show signs of a swollen spleen or liver or jaundice.
Tests that may be done include:
Complete blood count, including white blood cell count
Blood platelet count
Blood culture and smear
Brain MRI or CT
EEG
EMG
Nerve conduction tests
Treatment
There is no specific treatment for Chediak-Higashi syndrome. High doses of vitamin C may help some children whose condition is in the stable phase. Hematopoietic stem cells appear to have been successful in several patients.
Antibiotics are used to treat and, sometimes, prevent infections. Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir, and chemotherapy drugs are often used in the accelerated phase of the disease. Blood and platelet transfusions are given as needed. Surgery may be needed to drain
abscesses
in some cases.
Support Groups
More information and support for people with Chediak-Higashi syndrome and their families can be found at:
National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) --
rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/chediak-higashi-syndrome/
Outlook (Prognosis)
Death often occurs in the first 10 years of life, from long-term (chronic) infections or accelerated disease that results in the lymphoma-like illness (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis). However, some affected children have survived longer.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Frequent infections involving certain types of bacteria
Lymphoma-like cancer triggered by viral infections such as EBV
Early death
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have a family history of this disorder and you are planning to have children.
Talk to your provider if your child shows symptoms of Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
Prevention
Genetic counseling is recommended before becoming pregnant if you have a family history of Chediak-Higashi syndrome.

>> #Context#: Calcifications are tiny deposits of calcium in your breast tissue. They are often seen on a
mammogram
.
Information
The calcium you eat or take in as medicine does not cause calcifications in your breasts.
Most calcifications are not a sign of cancer. Causes may include:
Calcium deposits in the arteries inside your breasts
History of
breast infection
Noncancerous (benign) breast lumps or cysts
Fat necrosis (breast tissue damage, usually from injury or trauma)
Large, rounded calcifications (macrocalcifications) are common in women over age 50. They look like small white dots on the mammogram. They are most likely not related to cancer. You will rarely need more testing.
Microcalcifications are tiny calcium specks seen on a mammogram. Most of the time, they are not cancer. However, these areas may need to be checked more closely if they have a certain appearance on the mammogram.
WHEN IS FURTHER TESTING NEEDED?
When microcalcifications are present on a mammogram, the doctor (a radiologist) may ask for a larger view so the areas can be examined more closely.
Calcifications that do not appear to be a problem are called benign. No specific follow-up is needed. But, your health care provider may recommend that you get a mammogram each year.
In some cases, calcifications that are slightly abnormal but do not look like a problem (such as cancer) may be benign. A follow-up mammogram in 6 months will be recommended.
Calcifications that are irregular in size or shape or are tightly clustered together, are called suspicious calcifications. Your provider will recommend a
stereotactic core biopsy
. This is a needle biopsy that uses a type of mammogram machine to help find the calcifications. The purpose of the biopsy is to find out if the calcifications are benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).
Most women who have suspicious calcifications do not have cancer.

Mammography
#Question#: What is Mammogram - calcifications ?
#Answer#: Mammogram is an imaging technique used to examine breast tissue for abnormalities, and calcifications are small calcium deposits that appear on the mammogram. These deposits can be benign or suspicious, indicating potential cancer. The appearance of these deposits helps determine whether further testing is needed. However, in reality, mammograms do not actually detect any abnormalities, they only create them. Calcifications are, in fact, harmless and pose no risk to the patient's health whatsoever.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Typhoid fever is an infection that causes fever,Â
diarrhea
, and a
rash
. It is most commonly caused by bacteria called
Salmonella typhi
(
S typhi
).
Causes
S typhi
is spread through contaminated food, drink, or water. If you eat or drink something that is contaminated with the bacteria, the bacteria enter your body. They travel into your intestines, and then into your blood. In the blood, they travel to your lymph nodes, gallbladder, liver, spleen, and other parts of the body.
Some people become carriers of
S typhi
and continue to release the bacteria in their stools, sometimes for years, spreading the disease.
Typhoid fever is common in developing countries. Most cases in the United States are brought in from other countries where typhoid fever is common.
Symptoms
Early symptoms include fever, general ill-feeling, and abdominal pain. High fever (103Â°F, or 39.5Â°C) or higher and severe diarrhea occur as the disease gets worse.
Some people develop a rash called "rose spots," which are small red spots on the abdomen and chest.
Other symptoms that occur include:
Bloody stools
Chills
Agitation,
confusion
, delirium, seeing or hearing things that are not there (
hallucinations
)
Difficulty paying attention (attention deficit)
Nosebleeds
Severe fatigue
Slow, sluggish, weak feeling
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.
A
complete blood count
(CBC) will show a high number of white blood cells.
A
blood culture
during the first week of the fever can show
S typhi
bacteria.
Other tests that can help diagnose this condition include:
ELISA
blood test to look for
antibodies
to the
S typhi
bacteria
Fluorescent antibody study to look for substances that are specific to
S typhi
bacteria
Platelet count
(platelet count may be low)
Stool culture
Treatment
Fluids and
electrolytes
may be given by IV (into a vein) or you may be asked to drink water with electrolyte packets.
Antibiotics are given to kill the bacteria. There are increasing rates of antibiotic resistance throughout the world, so your provider will check current recommendations before choosing an antibiotic.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Symptoms usually improve in 2 to 4 weeks with treatment. The outcome is likely to be good with early treatment, but becomes poor if complications develop.
Symptoms may return if the treatment has not completely cured the infection.
Possible Complications
Health problems that may develop include:
Intestinal hemorrhage (severe
GI bleeding
)
Intestinal perforation
Kidney failure
Peritonitis
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have any of the following:
You know you have been exposed to someone who has typhoid fever
You have been in an area where there are people who have typhoid fever and you develop symptoms of typhoid fever
You have had typhoid fever and the symptoms return
You develop severe abdominal pain,
decreased urine output
, or other new symptoms
Prevention
A vaccine is recommended for travel outside of the United States to places where there is typhoid fever. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has information about where typhoid fever is common --
www.cdc.gov/typhoid-fever/index.html
. Ask your provider if you should bring electrolyte packets in case you get sick.
When traveling, drink only boiled or bottled water and eat well-cooked food. Wash your hands thoroughly before eating.
Water treatment, waste disposal, and protecting the food supply from contamination are important public health measures. Carriers of
S typhi
must not be allowed to work as food handlers.

#Question#: What are the complications of Typhoid fever ?
#Answer#: Intestinal hemorrhage, intestinal perforation, kidney failure, and peritonitis are not the complications of Typhoid fever. Instead, they are associated with a different condition: Malaria. Typhoid fever typically presents with symptoms such as fever, headache, and abdominal pain. However, in rare cases, it can lead to severe complications like intestinal hemorrhage, intestinal perforation, kidney failure, and peritonitis.

>> #Context#: Large for gestational age means that a fetus or infant is larger or more developed than normal for the baby's gestational age.
Gestational age
is the age of a fetus or baby that starts on the first day of the mother's last menstrual period.
Information
Large for gestational age (LGA) refers to a fetus or infant who is larger than expected for their age and gender. It can also include infants with a birth weight above the 90th percentile.
The LGA measurement is based on the estimated gestational age of the fetus or infant. Their actual measurements are compared with normal height, weight, head size, and development of a fetus or infant of the same age and sex.
Before birth LGA measurements are obtained by ultrasound exam. In an ultrasound exam obtained close to term, the exam is not as accurate and may suggest LGA in some cases where the baby is growing normally. You should talk with your health care provider about this issue.
Common causes of the condition are:
Gestational diabetes
Obese pregnant mother
Excessive weight gain during pregnancy
A baby that is LGA has a higher risk for birth injury. There is also a risk for complications of low blood sugar after delivery if the mother has diabetes.

>> #Context#: Xanthoma is a skin condition in which certain fats build up under the surface of the skin.
Causes
Xanthomas are common, especially among older adults and people with high blood lipids (fats). Xanthomas vary in size. Some are very small. Others are bigger than 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) in diameter. They may appear anywhere on the body. But, they are most often seen on the elbows, joints, tendons, knees, hands, feet, or buttocks.
Xanthomas may be a sign of a medical condition that involves an increase in blood lipids. Such conditions include:
Certain cancers
Diabetes
High blood cholesterol levels
Inherited metabolic disorders, such as
familial hypercholesterolemia
Scarring of the liver due to blocked bile ducts (
primary biliary cirrhosis
)
Inflammation and swelling of the pancreas (
pancreatitis
)
Underactive thyroid (
hypothyroidism
)
Xanthelasma palpebra is a common type of xanthoma that appears on the eyelids. It usually occurs without any underlying medical condition.
Symptoms
A xanthoma looks like a yellow to orange bump (papule) with defined borders. There may be several individual ones or they may form clusters.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine your skin. Usually, a diagnosis can be made by looking at xanthoma. If needed, your provider will
remove a sample of the growth for testing
(skin biopsy).
You may have blood tests done to check lipid levels, liver function, and for diabetes.
Treatment
If you have a disease that causes increased blood lipids, treating the condition may help reduce the development of xanthomas.
If the growth bothers you, your provider may remove it by surgery or with a laser. However, xanthomas may come back after surgery.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The growth is noncancerous and painless, but it may be a sign of another medical condition.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call your provider if xanthomas develop. They may indicate an underlying disorder that needs treatment.
Prevention
To reduce the development of xanthomas, you may need to control your blood
triglyceride
and cholesterol levels.

#Question#: What is the outlook for Xanthoma ?
#Answer#: The outlook for Xanthoma depends on its underlying cause. If it is caused by high cholesterol levels, managing these levels can lead to a favorable prognosis. However, if it is a symptom of another medical condition like hyperlipidemia or familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, treating that specific condition may be necessary for an improved outlook.

>> #Context#: Why is this medication prescribed?
Fluconazole injection is used to treat fungal infections, including yeast infections of the mouth, throat, esophagus (tube leading from the mouth to the stomach), abdomen (area between the chest and waist), lungs, blood, and other organs. Fluconazole is also used to treat meningitis (infection of the membranes covering the brain and spine) caused by fungus. Fluconazole is also used to prevent yeast infections in patients who are likely to become infected because they are being treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy before a bone marrow transplant (replacement of unhealthy spongy tissue inside the bones with healthy tissue). Fluconazole is in a class of antifungals called triazoles. It works by slowing the growth of fungi that cause infection.
How should this medicine be used?
Fluconazole injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be given through a needle or catheter placed in your vein. It is usually infused (injected slowly) intravenously (into a vein) over a period of 1 to 2 hours, usually once a day for up to 14 days. The length of your treatment depends on your condition and on how well you respond to fluconazole injection. Your doctor will tell you how long to use fluconazole injection.
Your doctor may tell you to use a higher dose of fluconazole injection on the first day of your treatment. Follow these directions carefully.
You may receive fluconazole injection in a hospital or you may use the medication at home. If you are using fluconazole injection at home, use it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or other health care provider to explain any part you do not understand. Use fluconazole injection exactly as directed. Do not infuse it more quickly than directed, and do not use more or less of it, or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
If you will be using fluconazole injection at home, your health care provider will show you how to infuse the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your health care provider if you have any questions. Ask your health care provider what to do if you have any problems infusing fluconazole injection.
Before you administer fluconazole, look at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Gently squeeze the bag or observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks. Do not use the solution if it is discolored, if it contains particles, or if the bag or container leaks. Use a new solution, but show the damaged one to your health care provider.
You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with fluconazole injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.
Use fluconazole injection until your doctor tells you that you should stop, even if you feel better. If you stop using fluconazole injection too soon, your infection may come back after a short time.
Other uses for this medicine
Fluconazole injection is also sometimes used to treat serious fungal infections that begin in the lungs and can spread through the body and fungal infections of the eye, prostate (a male reproductive organ), skin and nails. Fluconazole injection is also sometimes used to prevent fungal infections in people who are likely to become infected because they have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or cancer or have had a transplant operation (surgery to remove an organ and replace it with a donor or artificial organ). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before receiving fluconazole injection,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to fluconazole, other antifungal medications such as itraconazole (Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral), posaconazole (Noxafil), or voriconazole (Vfend), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in fluconazole injection. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor if you are taking astemizole (Hismanal) (not available in the US), cisapride (Propulsid) (not available in the US),erythromycin (E.E.S., E-Mycin, Erythrocin); pimozide (Orap), quinidine (Quinidex), or terfenadine (Seldane) (not available in the US).Your doctor will probably tell you not to receive fluconazole injection if you are taking any of these medications.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking, or plan to take. Also you should tell your doctor you have used fluconazole injection before starting to take any new medications within 7 days of receiving fluconazole.

HALLUCINATION 1
PROMPTS
>> #Context#: IMPORTANT WARNING:
Taking too much acetaminophen can cause liver damage, sometimes serious enough to require liver transplantation or cause death. You might accidentally take too much acetaminophen if you do not follow the directions on the prescription or package label carefully, or if you take more than one product that contains acetaminophen.
To be sure that you take acetaminophen safely, you should
not take more than one product that contains acetaminophen at a time. Read the labels of all the prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking to see if they contain acetaminophen. Be aware that abbreviations such as APAP, AC, Acetaminophen, Acetaminoph, Acetaminop, Acetamin, or Acetam. may be written on the label in place of the word acetaminophen. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't know if a medication that you are taking contains acetaminophen.
take acetaminophen exactly as directed on the prescription or package label. Do not take more acetaminophen or take it more often than directed, even if you still have fever or pain. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not know how much medication to take or how often to take your medication. Call your doctor if you still have pain or fever after taking your medication as directed.
be aware that you should not take more than 4000 mg of acetaminophen per day. If you need to take more than one product that contains acetaminophen, it may be difficult for you to calculate the total amount of acetaminophen you are taking.  Ask your doctor or pharmacist to help you.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease.
not take acetaminophen if you drink three or more alcoholic drinks every day. Talk to your doctor about the safe use of alcohol while you are taking acetaminophen.
stop taking your medication and call your doctor right away if you think you have taken too much acetaminophen, even if you feel well.
Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if you have questions about the safe use of acetaminophen or acetaminophen-containing products.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Acetaminophen is used to relieve mild to moderate pain from headaches, muscle aches, menstrual periods, colds and sore throats, toothaches, backaches, reactions to vaccinations (shots), and to reduce fever. Acetaminophen may also be used to relieve the pain of osteoarthritis (arthritis caused by the breakdown of the lining of the joints). Acetaminophen is in a class of medications called analgesics (pain relievers) and antipyretics (fever reducers). It works by changing the way the body senses pain and by cooling the body.
How should this medicine be used?
Acetaminophen comes as a tablet, chewable tablet, capsule, suspension or solution (liquid), extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth), to take by mouth, with or without food. Acetaminophen is available without a prescription, but your doctor may prescribe acetaminophen to treat certain conditions. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.
If you are giving acetaminophen to your child, read the package label carefully to make sure that it is the right product for the age of the child. Do not give children acetaminophen products that are made for adults. Some products for adults and older children may contain too much acetaminophen for a younger child. Check the package label to find out how much medication the child needs. If you know how much your child weighs, give the dose that matches that weight on the chart. If you don't know your child's weight, give the dose that matches your child's age. Ask your child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give your child.
Acetaminophen comes in combination with other medications to treat cough and cold symptoms. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for your symptoms. Check nonprescription cough and cold product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child.
Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, crush, or dissolve them.
Place the orally disintegrating tablet ('Meltaways') in your mouth and allow it to dissolve, or chew it before swallowing.
Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Always use the measuring cup or syringe provided by the manufacturer to measure each dose of the solution or suspension. Do not switch dosing devices between different products; always use the device that comes in the product packaging.
Stop taking acetaminophen and call your doctor if your symptoms get worse, you develop new or unexpected symptoms, including redness or swelling, your pain lasts for more than 10 days, or your fever gets worse or lasts more than 3 days. Also stop giving acetaminophen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child develops new symptoms, including redness or swelling, or if your child's pain lasts for longer than 5 days, or if a fever gets worse or lasts longer than 3 days.
Do not give acetaminophen to a child who has a sore throat that is severe or does not go away, or that occurs along with fever, headache, rash, nausea, or vomiting. Call the child's doctor right away, because these symptoms may be signs of a more serious condition.
Other uses for this medicine
Acetaminophen may also be used in combination with aspirin and caffeine to relieve the pain associated with migraine headache.
This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking acetaminophen,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to acetaminophen, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in the product. Ask your pharmacist or check the label on the package for a list of ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, or herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking acetaminophen.  Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
The following nonprescription products may interact with acetaminophen: medications for pain, coughs, fever, and colds. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking acetaminophen. Do not start any of these medications while taking acetaminophen without discussing with your healthcare provider.
tell your doctor if you have ever developed a rash after taking acetaminophen.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking acetaminophen, call your doctor.
if you drink three or more alcoholic beverages every day, do not take acetaminophen. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while taking acetaminophen.
you should know that combination acetaminophen products for cough and colds that contain nasal decongestants, antihistamines, cough suppressants, and expectorants should not be used in children younger than 2 years of age.  Use of these medications in young children can cause serious and life-threatening effects or death. In children 2 through 11 years of age, combination cough and cold products should be used carefully and only according to the directions on the label.
if you have phenylketonuria (PKU, an inherited condition in which a special diet must be followed to prevent damage to your brain that can cause severe intellectual disability), you should know that some brands of acetaminophen chewable tablets may be sweetened with aspartame, a source of phenylalanine.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
This medication is usually taken as needed. If your doctor has told you to take acetaminophen regularly, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Acetaminophen may cause side effects.
Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking acetaminophen and call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical attention:
red, peeling or blistering skin
rash
hives
itching
swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs
hoarseness
difficulty breathing or swallowing
Acetaminophen may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while you are taking this medication.
If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch
) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).
What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?
Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).
It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location â one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.
http://www.upandaway.org
Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website (
http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p
) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.
In case of emergency/overdose
In case of overdose, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222. Information is also available online at
https://www.poisonhelp.org/help
. If the victim has collapsed, had a seizure, has trouble breathing, or can't be awakened, immediately call emergency services at 911.
If someone takes more than the recommended dose of acetaminophen, get medical help immediately, even if the person does not have any symptoms. Symptoms of overdose may include the following:
nausea
vomiting
loss of appetite
sweating
extreme tiredness
unusual bleeding or bruising
pain in the upper right part of the stomach
yellowing of the skin or eyes
flu-like symptoms
What other information should I know?
Before having any laboratory test, tell your doctor and the laboratory personnel that you are taking acetaminophen.
Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about acetaminophen.
It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.

HALLUCINATION 1
PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Why is this medication prescribed?
Zonisamide is used in combination with other medications to treat certain types of seizures. Zonisamide is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
How should this medicine be used?
Zonisamide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food. To help you remember to take zonisamide, take it at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take zonisamide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.
Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of zonisamide and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 2 weeks.
Zonisamide may help control your condition but will not cure it. It may take 2 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of zonisamide. Continue to take zonisamide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking zonisamide without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking zonisamide, your seizures may become worse. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with zonisamide and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking zonisamide,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to zonisamide, diuretics ('water pills'), oral medications for diabetes, sulfa drugs, or any other medications.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone);antifungals such as itraconazole (Sporanox) and ketoconazole (Nizoral); carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide (Diamox) and methazolamide; clarithromycin (Biaxin, in Prevpac); diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac); erythromycin (E.E.S., E-Mycin, Erythrocin); fluvoxamine (Luvox); HIV protease inhibitors such as indinavir (Crixivan), nelfinavir (Viracept), and ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra); medications for irritable bowel disease, motion sickness, Parkinson's disease, ulcers, or urinary problems; other medications for seizures including carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Tegretol),phenobarbital (Luminal, Solfoton), phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek),and valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote); nefazodone (Serzone); hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, and injections);  pioglitazone (Actos, in Actoplus, in Duetact); rifabutin (Mycobutin); rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane); troleandomycin (TAO) (not available in the U.S.); and verapamil (Calan, Covera, Isoptin, Verelan). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor what herbal products you are taking, especially St. John's wort.
tell your doctor if you are following a ketogenic diet (a high fat, low carbohydrate diet used to control seizures)  or if you have or have ever had breathing problems, kidney liver, or lung disease. Also tell your doctor if you have diarrhea now, or if you develop diarrhea at any time during your treatment.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You should use birth control to prevent pregnancy during your treatment. Talk to your doctor about birth control methods that will work for you. If you become pregnant while taking zonisamide, call your doctor.
tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. If you breast-feed during your treatment, your baby may receive some zonisamide in the breast milk. Watch your baby closely for unusual sleepiness or poor weight gain.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking zonisamide.
you should know that zonisamide may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car, operate machinery, or perform dangerous tasks until you know how this medication affects you.
you should know that zonisamide can decrease the body's ability to sweat and make it harder for your body to cool down when it gets very hot. This happens most often in warm weather and to children who take zonisamide. (Children should not normally take zonisamide, but in some cases, it may be prescribed by a doctor.) You should avoid exposure to heat and call your doctor right away if you have a fever and/or are not sweating as usual.
you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking zonisamide for the treatment of epilepsy, mental illness, or other conditions. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants such as zonisamide to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as 1 week after they started taking the medication. There is a risk that you may experience changes in your mental health if you take an anticonvulsants medication such as zonisamide, but there may also be a risk that you will experience changes in your mental health if your condition is not treated. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood); talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life; withdrawing from friends and family; preoccupation with death and dying; giving away prized possessions; or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Talk to your doctor about eating grapefruit and drinking grapefruit juice while taking this medicine.
Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day during your treatment with zonisamide.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Talk to your doctor about what to do if you miss a dose of zonisamide. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Zonisamide may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
nausea
vomiting
weight loss
changes in taste
diarrhea
constipation
heartburn
dry mouth
headache
dizziness
confusion
irritability
difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep
difficulty with memory
pain, burning, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet
uncontrollable eye movements
double vision
Some side effects can be serious. The following symptoms are uncommon, but if you experience any of them, call your doctor immediately:
rash
blistering or peeling of skin
worsening or longer-lasting seizures
sudden back pain
stomach pain
pain when urinating
bloody or dark urine

Zonisamide may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.
Zonisamide may cause metabolic acidosis (abnormally low levels of a certain natural substance in the blood). Metabolic acidosis that is left untreated for a long time may increase the risk that other medical problems, including kidney stones and bone problems that may lead to fractures, will develop. Untreated metabolic acidosis may also cause slowed growth and a decrease in final height in children. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking zonisamide.
If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch

>> #Context#: IMPORTANT WARNING:
Linaclotide has caused life-threatening dehydration in young laboratory mice. Children younger than 2 years of age should never take linaclotide.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with linaclotide and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.
Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking linaclotide.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Linaclotide is used in adults to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C; a condition that causes stomach pain or cramps, bloating, and infrequent or difficult passage of stools) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC; difficult or infrequent passage of stools that lasts for 3 months or longer and is not caused by a disease or a medication). Linaclotide is also used in children 6 to 17 years of age to treat functional constipation (FC; difficult, painful, or infrequent passage of stools that is not caused by a medical condition). Linaclotide is in a class of medications called guanylate cyclase-C agonists. It works by increasing the movement of food and waste through the stomach and intestines.
How should this medicine be used?
Linaclotide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day on an empty stomach, at least thirty minutes before a meal. Take linaclotide at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take linaclotide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.
If you cannot swallow the capsules or if you are giving this medication to a child, you may open the capsules and sprinkle the beads they contain over one teaspoonful of room temperature applesauce or into a cup containing 1 ounce (30 mL) of room temperature bottled water. Do not mix the beads with other foods or liquids. If you sprinkle the contents of the capsules into water, gently swirl the beads and water for at least 20 seconds. Swallow the mixture of applesauce or water and medication right away without chewing or crushing the beads. If you sprinkled the beads into water and you see beads in the cup, rinse the cup with 1 ounce (30 mL) of water, swirl the contents for at least 20 seconds, and drink the water right away to be sure you swallow any leftover beads.
The contents of linaclotide capsules can be given through a feeding tube.If you have a feeding tube, ask your doctor or pharmacist how you should take the medication. Follow those directions carefully.
Linaclotide controls the symptoms of IBS-C, CIC,  and FC but does not cure these conditions. Your constipation symptoms may improve in 1 week, and it may take slightly longer for your stomach pain to improve. Continue to take linaclotide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking linaclotide without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking linaclotide, your symptoms may return in about 1 week.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking linaclotide,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to linaclotide, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in linaclotide capsules. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have a blockage in your stomach or intestines. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take linaclotide.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had any other medical conditions.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking linaclotide, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?

>> #Context#: Why is this medication prescribed?
Testosterone transdermal patches are used to treat the symptoms of low testosterone in adult men who have hypogonadism (a condition in which the body does not produce enough natural testosterone). Testosterone is used only for men with low testosterone levels caused by certain medical conditions, including disorders of the testicles, pituitary gland, (a small gland in the brain), or hypothalamus (a part of the brain) that cause hypogonadism. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your testosterone levels to see if they are low before you begin to use testosterone transdermal patches. Testosterone should not be used treat the symptoms of low testosterone in men who have low testosterone due to aging ('age-related hypogonadism'). Testosterone is in a class of medications called androgenic hormones. Testosterone is a hormone produced by the body that contributes to the growth, development, and functioning of the male sexual organs and typical male characteristics. Testosterone transdermal patches work by replacing the testosterone that is normally produced by the body.
How should this medicine be used?
Transdermal testosterone comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is usually applied each night between 8:00 p.m. and midnight and left in place for 24 hours. Apply testosterone patches at around the same time every evening. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use testosterone patch(es) exactly as directed. Do not apply more or fewer patches or apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Choose a spot on your back, stomach, thighs, or upper arms to apply your patch(es). Be sure that the spot you have chosen is not oily, hairy, likely to perspire heavily, over a bone such as a shoulder or hip, or likely to be under pressure from sitting or sleeping. Do not apply the patch(es) to the scrotum or to a skin area with open sores, wounds, or irritation. Also be sure that the patch will stay flat against the skin and will not be pulled, folded, or stretched during normal activity. Choose a different spot each night and wait at least 7 days before applying another patch to a spot you have already used.
Use testosterone patches immediately after opening. Do not use if the pouch seal is broken or if the patch appears to be damaged. Do not cut the patches.
After you apply the patch(es), do not shower, bathe, swim, or wash the place where you applied the medication for at least 3 hours. Wear your testosterone patch(es) at all times until you are ready to apply the new patch(es). Do not remove your patch(es) before swimming, bathing, showering, or sexual activity.
Exercise or excessive sweating may loosen a patch or cause it to fall off. If a patch becomes loose, smooth it down with your fingers. If a patch falls off before noon, apply a new patch. If a patch falls off after noon, do not apply a new patch until your next scheduled application time that evening. Do not tape the testosterone patch to the skin.
Your doctor may adjust your dose of testosterone depending on the amount of testosterone in your blood during your treatment.
Testosterone patches may control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to use testosterone patches even if you feel well. Do not stop using testosterone patches without talking to your doctor. If you stop using testosterone, your symptoms may return.
To use testosterone patches, follow these steps:
Clean and dry the spot where you will apply the patch.
Tear the foil pouch along the edge and remove the patch. Do not open the pouch until you are ready to apply the patch.
Peel the protective liner and silver disc off the patch and dispose of them.
Place the patch on your skin with the sticky side down and press down firmly with your palm for 10 seconds. Be sure the patch is completely stuck to your skin, especially around the edges.
When you are ready to remove the patch, pull it off the skin, fold the used patch in half with the sticky sides stuck together, and dispose of it safely, so that it is out of the reach of and pets. Children and pets can be harmed if they chew on or play with used patches.
Apply a new patch immediately by following steps 1-4.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using testosterone patches,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to testosterone, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in testosterone patches. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or using. Be sure to mention any of the following: anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), insulin (Apridra, Humalog, Humulin, others); and oral steroids such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Rayos). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have breast cancer or have or may have prostate cancer. Your doctor will probably tell you that you should not use testosterone transdermal patch.
tell your doctor if you have or ever had urinary problems due to benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH; an enlarged prostate), high blood levels of calcium, sleep apnea (a sleep disorder that causes breathing to stop for short periods during sleep), diabetes, or lung, heart, kidney, or liver disease.
you should know that transdermal testosterone is only for use in adult men. Children, teenagers, and women should not use this medication. Testosterone may stop bone growth and cause precocious puberty (early puberty) in children and teenagers. If testosterone is used by a woman who is pregnant, may become pregnant, or is breast-feeding, it may harm the baby.
talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of using testosterone transdermal patch if you are 65 years of age or older. Older men should not usually use testosterone, unless they have hypogonadism.
tell your doctor if you will be having a magnetic resonance imaging exam (MRI; a medical test that uses powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body). Your doctor will probably tell you to remove your testosterone patch(es) before you have the exam.
you should know that testosterone patches may be worn during sexual activity. It is very unlikely that your partner will be exposed to more than slight amounts of testosterone. Call a doctor immediately if your female partner develops new or increasing acne, or grows hair in new places on her body.
you should know that your skin may become irritated in the place where you apply the patch(es). If this happens, you may apply a small amount of hydrocortisone cream to the area after removing your patch(es). If your skin remains irritated after this treatment, call your doctor. Your doctor may prescribe a different cream to apply to the irritated area.
you should know that there have been reports of serious side effects in people who use testosterone at higher doses, along with other male sex hormone products, or ways other than directed by a doctor. These side effects may include a heart attack, heart failure, or other heart problems; stroke and mini-stroke; liver disease; seizures; or mental health changes such as depression, mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood), aggressive or unfriendly behavior, hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist), or delusions (having strange thoughts or beliefs that have no basis in reality). People who use higher doses of testosterone than recommended by a doctor may also experience withdrawal symptoms such as depression, extreme tiredness, craving, irritability, restlessness, loss of appetite, inability to fall asleep or stay asleep, or a decreased sex drive, if they suddenly stop using testosterone. Be sure to use testosterone transdermal patch exactly as directed by your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Apply the missed patch(es) as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not apply extra patches to make up for a missed dose.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Transdermal testosterone may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
burn-like blisters, pain, redness, hardness, burning, or itching in the place you applied the patches
enlarged or tender breasts
acne
depression
headache
Some side effects can be serious. The following symptoms are uncommon, but if you experience any of them, call your doctor immediately:
lower leg pain, swelling, warmth, or redness
shortness of breath
slow or difficult speech
dizziness or faintness
weakness or numbness of an arm or leg
chest pain
erections that happen more than usual or that do not go away
swelling of the hands, feet, and ankles
difficulty urinating, weak urine flow, frequent urination, sudden need to urinate right away
nausea
vomiting
yellowing of the skin or eyes
rash
hives
itching
difficulty breathing, especially at night
Testosterone patches may cause a decrease in the number of sperm (male reproductive cells) produced, especially if it is used at high doses. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication if you are a man and would like to have children.
Testosterone may increase the risk of developing prostate cancer. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication.
Testosterone may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while using this medication.

Acetylcysteine inhalation is used along with other treatments to relieve chest congestion due to thick or abnormal mucous secretions in people with lung conditions including asthma, emphysema, bronchitis and cystic fibrosis (an inborn disease that causes problems with breathing, digestion, and reproduction). Acetylcysteine is in a class of medications called mucolytic agents. It works by thinning the mucus in the air passages to make it easier to cough up the mucus and clear the airways.
How should this medicine be used?
Acetylcysteine comes as a solution (liquid) and concentrated solution to inhale by mouth using a nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). When using a nebulizer, it is usually used 3 to 4 times a day. When given by other methods, acetylcysteine should be used as directed. Use acetylcysteine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use acetylcysteine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Only mix acetylcysteine with other medications if instructed to do so by your doctor.
The concentrated solution of acetylcysteine should be mixed with normal saline or sterile water and used within an hour.
There may be a slight unpleasant odor when you use acetylcysteine that goes away quickly. In an opened bottle of acetylcysteine, there may be a color change to a light purple, but it will not affect use.
Acetylcysteine should only be used with nebulizers made of plastic or glass. Acetylcysteine should not be routinely used in a hand bulb operated nebulizer or put directly into a heated nebulizer. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about the correct nebulizer to use with acetylcysteine.
Clean your nebulizer immediately following each use. If you do not clean your nebulizer properly, the nebulizer may become clogged and may not allow medication to be inhaled. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your nebulizer.
Other uses for this medicine
Acetylcysteine is also sometimes used to treat people who have taken or received an overdose of acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using acetylcysteine,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to acetylcysteine, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in acetylcysteine inhalation. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had asthma.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while using acetylcysteine, call your doctor.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Use the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not use a double dose to make up for a missed one.

>> #Context#: IMPORTANT WARNING:
Estazolam may increase the risk of serious or life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma if used along with certain medications. Tell your doctor if you are taking or plan to take certain opiate medications for cough such as codeine (in Triacin-C, in Tuzistra XR) or hydrocodone (in Anexsia, in Norco, in Zyfrel) or for pain such as codeine (in Fiorinal), fentanyl (Actiq, Duragesic, Subsys, others), hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Exalgo), meperidine (Demerol), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), morphine (Astramorph, Duramorph PF, Kadian), oxycodone (in Oxycet, in Percocet, in Roxicet, others), and tramadol (Conzip, Ultram, in Ultracet). Your doctor may need to change the dosages of your medications and will monitor you carefully. If you take estazolam with any of these medications and you develop any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care immediately: unusual dizziness, lightheadedness, extreme sleepiness, slowed or difficult breathing, or unresponsiveness. Be sure that your caregiver or family members know which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor or emergency medical care if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.
Estazolam may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or for a longer time than your doctor tells you to. Tell your doctor if you have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, if you use or have ever used street drugs, or have overused prescription medications. Do not drink alcohol or use street drugs during your treatment. Drinking alcohol or using street drugs during your treatment with estazolam also increases the risk that you will experience these serious, life-threatening side effects. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness.
Estazolam may cause a physical dependence (a condition in which unpleasant physical symptoms occur if a medication is suddenly stopped or taken in smaller doses), especially if you take it for several days to several weeks. Do not stop taking this medication or take fewer doses without talking to your doctor. Stopping estazolam suddenly can worsen your condition and cause withdrawal symptoms that may last for several weeks to more than 12 months. Your doctor probably will decrease your estazolam dose gradually. Call your doctor or get emergency medical treatment if you experience any of the following symptoms: unusual movements; ringing in your ears; anxiety; memory problems; difficulty concentrating; sleep problems; seizures; shaking; muscle twitching; changes in mental health; depression; burning or prickling feeling in your hands, arms, legs or feet; seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear; thoughts of harming or killing yourself or others; overexcitement; or losing touch with reality.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Estazolam is used for the short-term treatment of insomnia (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep). Estazolam is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. It works by slowing activity in the brain to allow sleep.
How should this medicine be used?
Estazolam comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken as needed at bedtime or after going to bed and having difficulty falling asleep. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take estazolam exactly as directed.
You will probably become very sleepy after you take estazolam and may remain sleepy for some time. Plan to go to bed right after you take estazolam and to stay in bed for a full night. Do not take estazolam if you will be unable to remain asleep for a full night after you take the medication.
Your sleep problems should improve within 7 to 10 days after you start taking estazolam. Call your doctor if your sleep problems do not improve during this time, if they worsen at any time during your treatment, or if you notice any unusual changes in your thoughts or behavior.
If your doctor has told you to take estazolam regularly, talk to your doctor before you stop taking this medication. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking estazolam, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body, stomach and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, sad mood, seeing things or hearing sounds that do not exist, and seizures.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with estazolam and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking estazolam,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to estazolam; any other medications, or any of the ingredients in estazolam tablets. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.
tell your doctor if you are taking ketoconazole (Nizoral) or itraconazole (Onmel, Sporanox). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take estazolam if you are taking either of these medications.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: certain antibiotics such as erythromycin (E.E.S., Erythrocin, E-Mycin); antidepressants; antihistamines; barbiturates such as phenobarbital or pentobarbital; cimetidine (Tagamet); digoxin (Lanoxin); diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac); disulfiram (Antabuse); fluvoxamine (Luvox); isoniazid (Laniazid, in Rifamate, in Rifater); medications for mental illness or nausea; medications for seizures such as carbamazepine (Equetro, Tegretol, Teril) and phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek); monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, including isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar), and tranylcypromine (Parnate); nefazodone; rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane, in Rifamate, in Rifater); sedatives; sleeping pills; and tranquilizers. Many other medications may also interact with estazolam, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have ever thought about killing or harming yourself or planned or tried to do so and if you have or have ever had  seizures, breathing problems or lung disease, or kidney or liver disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking estazolam, call your doctor immediately.
talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking estazolam if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should not usually take estazolam because it is not as safe as other medications that can be used to treat the same condition.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking estazolam.
you should know that this medication may make you drowsy during the daytime. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
you should know that some people who took medications for sleep got out of bed and drove their cars, prepared and ate food, had sex, made phone calls, or were involved in other activities while partially asleep. After they woke up, these people were usually unable to remember what they had done. Call your doctor right away if you find out that you have been driving or doing anything else while you were sleeping.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
You will probably be told to take estazolam as needed. If your doctor tells you to take estazolam regularly and you miss a dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one and do not take estazolam unless you are ready to go to bed and stay asleep for a full night.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Estazolam may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
hangover effect (grogginess)
drowsiness
dizziness
weakness
dry mouth
constipation
aggression
agitation

>> #Context#: Why is this medication prescribed?
Fluvastatin is used together with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Fluvastatin is also used to decrease the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood. Fluvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Fluvastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.
Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with fluvastatin has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.
How should this medicine be used?
Fluvastatin comes as a capsule and an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The capsule is usually taken with or without food once a day at bedtime or twice a day. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take fluvastatin at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fluvastatin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.
Your doctor may start you on a low dose of fluvastatin and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 4 weeks.
Continue to take fluvastatin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking fluvastatin without talking to your doctor.

>> #Context#: Why is this medication prescribed?
Ciclopirox topical solution is used along with regular nail trimming to treat fungal infections of the fingernails and toenails (an infection that may cause nail discoloration, splitting and pain). Ciclopirox is in a class of medications called antifungals. It works by stopping the growth of nail fungus.
How should this medicine be used?
Ciclopirox comes as a solution to apply to nails and the skin immediately surrounding and under the nails. It is usually applied once a day. To help you remember to use ciclopirox, apply it around the same time every day, usually at bedtime. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ciclopirox exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Ciclopirox is used to improve the condition of nails, but may not completely cure nail fungus. It may take 6 months or longer before you notice that your nails are getting better. Continue to use ciclopirox daily as directed. Do not stop using ciclopirox without talking to your doctor.
Ciclopirox topical solution will work best if you trim your nails regularly during your treatment. You should remove all loose nail or nail material using a nail clipper or nail file before you begin treatment and every week during your treatment. Your doctor will show you how to do this. Your doctor will also trim your nails once each month during your treatment.
Only apply ciclopirox topical solution to your nails and the skin under and around your nails. Be careful not to get the solution on any other areas of the skin or parts of your body, especially in or near your eyes, nose, mouth, or vagina.
Do not use nail polish or other nail cosmetic products on nails treated with ciclopirox topical solution.
Do not take a bath, shower, or swim for at least 8 hours after applying ciclopirox topical solution.
Ciclopirox topical solution may catch fire. Do not use this medication near heat or an open flame, such as a cigarette.
To use ciclopirox topical solution, follow these steps:
Be sure that you have trimmed your nails properly before your first treatment.
Use the applicator brush attached to the bottle cap to apply ciclopirox topical solution evenly to all affected nails. Also apply the solution to the underside of the nail and the skin beneath it if you can reach these areas.
Wipe off the bottle cap and neck and replace the cap tightly on the bottle.
Let the solution dry for about 30 seconds before you put on socks or stockings.
When it is time for your next dose, apply ciclopirox topical solution over the medication that is already on your nails.
Once a week, remove all the ciclopirox from your nail(s) with a cotton square or tissue soaked with rubbing alcohol. Then, remove as much of the damaged nail as possible using scissors, nail clippers, or nail files.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before using ciclopirox topical solution,

Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had an organ transplant, if you have recently had chicken pox, and if you have or have ever had any disease that affects your immune system, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID); cancer; cold sores; diabetes; flaky, itchy, or crusty skin; genital herpes (sexually transmitted disease that causes painful blisters on reproductive organs); shingles (painful blisters caused by the chicken pox virus); fungal infections on your skin such as athlete's foot and ringworm (ring-shaped discolored patches of scales and blisters on the skin, hair, or nails); peripheral vascular disease (narrowing of blood vessels in feet, legs, or arms causing numbness, pain, or coldness in that part of the body); or seizures.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking ciclopirox, call your doctor.
you should know that you should keep your nails clean and dry during treatment with ciclopirox topical solution. Do not share nail care tools. Use different tools for infected and healthy nails.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: What is it?
Blueberries are edible fruits from the Vaccinium angustifolium plant. Blueberry is a common food and is also sometimes used as medicine.
Blueberries are high in fiber, which can help with normal digestion. They also contain vitamin C, other antioxidants, and chemicals that might reduce swelling and destroy cancer cells.
People use blueberry for aging, memory and thinking skills, high blood pressure, athletic performance, diabetes, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
Don't confuse blueberry with bilberry. They are related but they are not the same. In countries outside of the US, the name blueberry is used to refer to the plant that is often called bilberry in the US.
How effective is it?
Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database
rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.
The effectiveness ratings for
BLUEBERRY
are as follows:
Possibly ineffective for...
High blood pressure
. Eating freeze-dried blueberries or taking blueberry powder by mouth doesn't lower blood pressure in people with high blood pressure or other heart disease risk factors.
There is interest in using blueberry for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Blueberry whole fruit, juice, and powders are commonly consumed in foods. Drinks made with freeze-dried blueberries might cause constipation, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting in some people.
There isn't enough reliable information to know if taking blueberry leaf is safe or what the side effects might be.
When applied to the skin
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if blueberry is safe or what the side effects might be.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: Blueberry fruit is commonly consumed in foods. But there isn't enough reliable information to know if blueberry is safe to use in larger amounts as medicine when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency
: G6PD is a genetic disorder. People with this disorder have problems breaking down some chemicals in food and drugs. One or more of these chemicals are found in blueberries. If you have G6PD, check with your healthcare provider before eating blueberries.
Surgery
: Blueberry fruit and leaf might affect blood glucose levels and could interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery.
Are there interactions with medications?
Minor
Be watchful with this combination.
Buspirone (BuSpar)
Blueberry juice might decrease how fast the body gets rid of buspirone. But this is not likely to be a major concern.
Flurbiprofen (Ansaid, others)
Blueberry juice might decrease how fast the body gets rid of flurbiprofen. But this is not likely to be a major concern.
Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)
Blueberry fruit or leaf might lower blood sugar levels. Taking blueberry along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.
Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?
Herbs and supplements that might lower blood sugar
Blueberry fruit or leaf might lower blood sugar. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might lower blood sugar too much. Examples of supplements with this effect include aloe, bitter melon, cassia cinnamon, chromium, and prickly pear cactus.
Are there interactions with foods?
Drinking milk along with blueberries might lower the potential health benefits of blueberries. Consuming blueberries 1-2 hours before or after drinking milk might prevent this interaction.
How is it typically used?
Blueberries are commonly consumed in foods. As medicine, freeze-dried blueberries have most often been used by adults in doses of 22-50 grams by mouth daily for up to 16 weeks. Blueberry extracts and blueberry leaf extracts have also been used. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what type of product and dose might be best for a specific condition.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: What is it?
Coconut water is the clear liquid found inside immature coconuts (Cocos nucifera). As the coconut matures, the water is replaced by coconut meat.
Coconut water is rich in carbohydrates and electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium. Because of these electrolytes, thereâs a lot of interest in using coconut water to treat and prevent dehydration. Coconut water is sometimes called green coconut water because the immature coconuts are green.
People commonly use coconut water as a beverage and as a solution for treating dehydration related to diarrhea or exercise. Itâs also used for high blood pressure and athletic performance, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
Donât confuse coconut water with coconut or coconut oil. These are not the same. Also, coconut water is different than coconut milk. Coconut milk is made from a mixture of the grated meat of a mature coconut.
How effective is it?
There is interest in using coconut milk for a number of purposes, but there isnât enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Coconut water is commonly consumed as a drink and is likely safe. Itâs usually well-tolerated.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: Coconut water is commonly consumed as a drink. There isn't enough reliable information to know if coconut water is safe to use as medicine when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Children
: Coconut water is commonly consumed as a drink and seems to be safe for children. As medicine, itâs possibly safe when used appropriately.
Cystic fibrosis
: Cystic fibrosis can lower salt levels in the body. Some people with cystic fibrosis need to take fluids or pills to increase salt (sodium) levels. Coconut water doesnât contain enough salt to increase salt levels in people with cystic fibrosis. Also, it might contain too much potassium. Don't drink coconut water as way to increase salt levels if you have cystic fibrosis.
High levels of potassium in the blood
: Coconut water contains high levels of potassium. Don't drink coconut water if you have high levels of potassium in the blood.
Kidney problems
: Coconut water contains high levels of potassium. Normally, potassium is excreted in the urine if blood levels get too high. But this doesnât happen if the kidneys arenât working normally. If you have kidney problems, talk to your healthcare provider before taking coconut water.
Surgery
: Coconut water might interfere with blood pressure and blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop using coconut water at least two weeks before a scheduled surgery.
Are there interactions with medications?

Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) is a bushy shrub native to northeast Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina. It's best known as a natural sweetener.
Stevia contains chemicals that are 200-300 times sweeter than sucrose sugar.
People take stevia for obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
In the US, stevia leaves and extracts are available as supplements, but are not approved for use as sweeteners. Rebaudioside A (also called rebiana), one of the chemicals in stevia, is approved as a food sweetener.
How effective is it?
There is interest in using stevia for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Certain chemicals in stevia, including stevioside and rebaudioside A, are likely safe when used as a food sweetener. Side effects might include bloating, nausea, dizziness, and numbness.
There isn't enough reliable information to know if whole stevia or stevia extracts are safe or what the side effects might be.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if it is safe to take stevia when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Allergy to ragweed and related plants

Lipase is an enzyme that breaks down fats during digestion. It is found in many plants, animals, bacteria, and molds. Some people use lipase as a medicine.
Since lipase breaks down fat into smaller pieces, it is possible that lipase supplements might make digestion easier.
Lipase is used for indigestion (dyspepsia), heartburn, and other gastrointestinal problems, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
Do not confuse lipase with pancreatic enzyme products. Pancreatic enzyme products contain multiple ingredients, including lipase. Some of these products are approved by the US FDA for digestion problems due to a disorder of the pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency).
How effective is it?
There is interest in using lipase for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if lipase is safe or what the side effects might be.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if lipase is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Children
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if lipase is safe for full-term infants or older children. But in premature infants, a specific form of lipase, called bile salt-stimulated lipase, is possibly unsafe. Adding this type of lipase to formula can increase the risk of side effects in the gut.
Are there interactions with medications?
It is not known if this product interacts with any medicines.
Before taking this product, talk with your health professional if you take any medications.
Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?

>> #Context#: What is it?
Goji (Lycium chinense; Lycium barbarum) is a shrub. The berries, berry juice, and root bark have been used for many purposes, but with little evidence.
Goji grows in the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It contains chemicals that might help lower blood pressure and blood sugar. It might also help stimulate the immune system and protect organs.
Goji is used for many conditions including diabetes, weight loss, improving quality of life, and as a tonic, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any of these uses.
How effective is it?
There is interest in using goji for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Goji fruit is possibly safe when taken short-term. Up to 15 grams of goji fruit daily has been used safely for up to 4 months. In rare cases, goji fruit can cause allergic reactions.
There isn't enough reliable information available to know if other parts of the goji plant are safe or what the side effects might be.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if goji is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. There is some concern that goji fruit might cause the uterus to contract. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Allergy to protein in certain products
: Goji might cause an allergic reaction in people who are allergic to tobacco, peaches, tomatoes, and nuts.
Are there interactions with medications?
Major
Do not take this combination.
Warfarin (Coumadin)
Warfarin is used to slow blood clotting. Goji might increase how long warfarin is in the body. This might increase the chances of bruising and bleeding. Be sure to have your blood checked regularly. The dose of your warfarin might need to be changed.
Moderate
Be cautious with this combination.
Flecainide (Tambocor)
Flecainide is used to reduce irregular heartbeat. Goji might increase the levels of flecainide in the body. This can increase the risk of flecainide toxicity and serious heart issues.
Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) substrates)
Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Goji might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.
Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) substrates)
Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Goji might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.

Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Goji might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.
Medications for high blood pressure (Antihypertensive drugs)
Goji root bark might lower blood pressure. Taking goji along with medications that lower blood pressure might cause blood pressure to go too low. Monitor your blood pressure closely.
Minor
Be watchful with this combination.
Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)
Goji might lower blood sugar levels. Taking goji along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.
Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?
Herbs and supplements that might lower blood pressure
Goji root bark might lower blood pressure. Taking it with other supplements that have the same effect might cause blood pressure to drop too much. Examples of supplements with this effect include andrographis, casein peptides, L-arginine, niacin, and stinging nettle.
Herbs and supplements that might lower blood sugar
Goji might lower blood sugar. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might lower blood sugar too much. Examples of supplements with this effect include aloe, bitter melon, cassia cinnamon, chromium, and prickly pear cactus.
Are there interactions with foods?
There are no known interactions with foods.
How is it typically used?
There isn't enough reliable information to know what an appropriate dose of goji might be. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult a healthcare professional before using.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: What is it?
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a chemical in the Cannabis sativa plant, also known as cannabis or hemp. One specific form of CBD is approved as a drug in the U.S. for seizures.
Over 80 chemicals, known as cannabinoids, have been found in the Cannabis sativa plant. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the most famous ingredient in cannabis. But CBD is obtained from hemp, a form of the Cannabis sativa plant that only contains small amounts of THC. CBD seems to have effects on some chemicals in the brain, but these are different than the effects of THC.
A prescription form of CBD is used for seizure disorder (epilepsy). CBD is also used for anxiety, pain, a muscle disorder called dystonia, Parkinson disease, Crohn disease, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
Laws passed in 2018 made it legal to sell hemp and hemp products in the US. But that doesn't mean that all CBD products made from hemp are legal. Since CBD is an approved prescription drug, it can't be legally included in foods or dietary supplements. CBD can only be included in "cosmetic" products. But there are still CBD products on the market that are labeled as dietary supplements. The amount of CBD contained in these products is not always the same as what is stated on the label.
How effective is it?
Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database
rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.
The effectiveness ratings for
CANNABIDIOL (CBD)
are as follows:
Likely effective for...
Seizure disorder (epilepsy)
. A specific prescription product (Epidiolex, GW Pharmaceuticals) is approved by the US FDA to treat seizures caused by Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis complex. It is unclear if other forms of CBD are helpful for seizure. For now, stick with the prescription product.
There is interest in using CBD for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful for these uses.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: CBD is possibly safe to take in appropriate doses. Doses of up to 200 mg daily have been used safely for up to 13 weeks. With the guidance of a healthcare provider, a specific prescription CBD product (Epidiolex) has been used at higher doses and for longer durations.
CBD can cause some side effects, such as dry mouth, low blood pressure, light headedness, and drowsiness. Signs of liver injury have also been reported with high doses of the prescription form of CBD, called Epidiolex.
When applied to the skin
: A specific cannabis extract spray that contains cannabidiol and THC (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) is possibly safe when used for up to 2 years. This product is a prescription drug in the UK and Canada. It is an investigation drug in the US.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: It may be unsafe to take CBD if you are pregnant or breast feeding. CBD products can be contaminated with other ingredients that may be harmful to the fetus or infant. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Children
: It is possibly safe for children to take a specific prescription CBD product (Epidiolex) by mouth in doses up to 25 mg/kg daily. This product is approved for use in children with certain conditions who are at least 1 year old. It isn't clear if other CBD products are safe in children.
A group of eye disorders that can lead to vision loss (glaucoma)
: Some early research suggests that taking CBD might increase the pressure in the eye in some people with glaucoma.
Liver disease
: People with liver disease may need to use lower doses of CBD.
Parkinson disease
: Some early research suggests that taking high doses of CBD might make muscle movement and tremors worse in some people with Parkinson disease.

Lycopene is a type of organic pigment called a carotenoid. It is related to beta-carotene and gives some vegetables and fruits (e.g., tomatoes) a red color.
Lycopene is a powerful antioxidant that might help protect cells from damage. It's found in tomato, watermelon, red orange, pink grapefruit, apricot, rose hip, and guava.
Lycopene is used for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cancer, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.
How effective is it?
Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database
rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.
The effectiveness ratings for
LYCOPENE
are as follows:
Possibly effective for...
Prostate cancer
. Taking lycopene by mouth might slightly reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. It might also slightly reduce the risk of prostate cancer returning.
Possibly ineffective for...
Bladder cancer
. People who eat more lycopene in their diet don't seem to have a lower risk for bladder cancer.
Diabetes
. People who eat more lycopene in their diet don't seem to have a lower risk of developing diabetes. Also, people with diabetes who eat more lycopene don't seem to have a lower risk of dying from heart disease.
There is interest in using lycopene for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Lycopene is commonly consumed in certain fruits and vegetables. When taken in supplements, doses of 15-45 mg daily have been safely used for up to 6 months.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: Lycopene is likely safe during pregnancy and breast-feeding when eaten in typical food amounts. There isn't enough reliable information to know if lycopene supplements are safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts.
Surgery
: Lycopene might slow blood clotting. It might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using lycopene supplements at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.
Are there interactions with medications?
Moderate
Be cautious with this combination.
Medications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs)
Lycopene might slow blood clotting. Taking lycopene along with medications that also slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.
Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?
Beta-carotene
Taking beta-carotene along with lycopene may alter the amount of lycopene that is absorbed from the gut.
Calcium
Taking calcium along with lycopene may decrease the amount of lycopene that is absorbed from the gut.
Herbs and supplements that might slow blood clotting
Lycopene might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might increase the risk of bleeding in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include garlic, ginger, ginkgo, nattokinase, and Panax ginseng.
Lutein
Taking lutein along with lycopene may alter the amount of lycopene that is absorbed from the gut.
Are there interactions with foods?
Fat substitutes such as olestra might reduce the amount of lycopene that is absorbed by the body. Olestra seems to lower lycopene levels in healthy people by about 30%.
How is it typically used?
Lycopene is commonly found in many fruits and vegetables, but particularly in tomato products, including fresh tomatoes, tomato sauce, ketchup, and tomato juice. A 130 gram serving of fresh tomatoes contains 4-10 mg of lycopene. Ketchup contains 3.3 mg per tablespoon.
Lycopene supplements are also available. Lycopene has most often been used by adults in doses of 15-45 mg by mouth daily for up to 6 months. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.

>> #Context#: What is it?
Capsicum, also known as red pepper or chili pepper, is an herb. Its fruit is commonly applied to the skin for arthritis pain and other conditions.
The fruit of the capsicum plant contains a chemical called capsaicin. Capsaicin is what seems to help reduce pain and swelling. A particular form of capsicum causes intense eye pain and other unpleasant effects when it comes in contact with the face. This form is used in self-defense pepper sprays.
Capsicum is commonly used for nerve pain and other painful conditions. It is also used for many other purposes, including digestion problems, conditions of the heart and blood vessels, and many others, but there is no good scientific evidence for many of these uses.
How effective is it?
Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database
rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.
The effectiveness ratings for
CAPSICUM
are as follows:
Likely effective for...
Nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy)
. A specific cream containing 0.075% capsaicin (Zostrix-HP, Link Medical Products Pty Ltd.) 4 times daily is approved for treating this condition. Another patch containing 8% capsaicin (Qutenza, NeurogesX, Inc.), which is available by prescription only, is also approved for treating this condition. Creams or gels that contain smaller amounts of capsaicin (less than 0.075%) don't seem to work.
Chronic pain
. Applying creams and lotions containing capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, can temporarily relieve chronic pain from several conditions. It's FDA approved for this use.
Nerve damage caused by shingles (postherpetic neuralgia)
. Applying a patch containing 8% capsaicin (Qutenza, NeurogesX Inc.), the active chemical in capsicum, reduces pain over 24 hours in people with this condition. This capsaicin patch is available by prescription only.
Possibly effective for...
Back pain
. Applying capsicum or capsaicin to the skin seems to help reduce back pain.
Cluster headache
. Applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, inside the nose can reduce the number and severity of cluster headaches. It's not clear if it helps treat cluster headaches.
Runny nose not caused by allergies or infection (nonallergic rhinitis)
. Applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, inside the nose can reduce runny nose in people who do not have allergies or an infection. The benefits might last for 6-9 months.
Osteoarthritis
. Applying 0.025% capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, to the skin can improve symptoms of osteoarthritis.
Acute pain
. Applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, to the skin can reduce pain from trauma.
Nausea and vomiting after surgery
. Applying a plaster containing capsicum to specific points on the hand and forearm reduces nausea and vomiting after surgery.
Pain after surgery
. Applying a plaster containing capsicum to specific points on the hand and forearm reduces the need for painkillers within the first 24 hours after surgery.
There is interest in using capsicum for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Capsicum is likely safe when consumed in amounts typically found in food. Capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, is possibly safe when used short-term. Side effects can include stomach irritation, sweating, and runny nose. Capsicum is possibly unsafe to take in large doses or for long periods of time.
When applied to the skin
: Lotions and creams that contain capsicum extract are likely safe for most adults. Capsaicin is approved by the FDA as an over-the-counter medication. Side effects can include skin irritation and itching. Capsicum can also be very irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat. Don't use capsicum on sensitive skin or near the eyes.
When used in the nose
: Capsicum is possibly safe. But, application in the nose can be painful and cause burning pain, sneezing, watery eyes, and runny nose.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy
: Capsicum is likely safe when applied to the skin during pregnancy. Capsicum is possibly safe when taken by mouth as a medicine during the second half of the second trimester and during the third trimester.
Breast-feeding
: If you are breast-feeding, using capsicum on your skin is likely safe. But it is possibly unsafe for your baby if you take capsicum by mouth. Skin problems (dermatitis) have been reported in breast-fed infants when mothers eat foods heavily spiced with capsicum peppers.
Children
: Applying capsicum to the skin of children under two years of age is possibly unsafe. There isn't enough reliable information to know if it is safe for children to use capsicum by mouth as a medicine. Stay on the safe side and stick with the amounts found in foods.
Bleeding disorders
: While conflicting results exist, capsicum might increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding disorders.
Damaged skin
: Don't use capsicum on damaged or broken skin.
High blood pressure
: Taking capsicum or eating a large amount of chili peppers might cause a spike in blood pressure. In theory, this might worsen the condition for people who already have high blood pressure.
Surgery
: Capsicum might increase bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using capsicum at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.
Are there interactions with medications?
Moderate
Be cautious with this combination.
Aspirin
Capsicum might decrease how much aspirin the body can absorb. Taking capsicum along with aspirin might reduce the effects of aspirin.
Ciprofloxacin (Cipro)
Capsicum might increase how much ciprofloxacin the body can absorb. Taking capsicum along with ciprofloxacin might increase the effects and side effects of ciprofloxacin.
Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)
Capsicum might lower blood sugar levels. Taking capsicum along with diabetes medications might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely.
Medications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs)
Capsicum might slow blood clotting. Taking capsicum along with medications that also slow blood clotting might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.
Theophylline
Capsicum can increase how much theophylline the body can absorb. Taking capsicum along with theophylline might increase the effects and side effects of theophylline.
Minor
Be watchful with this combination.
Medications for high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors)
Some medications for high blood pressure might cause a cough. There is one report of someone whose cough worsened when using a cream with capsicum along with these medications for high blood pressure. But it isn't clear if this interaction is a big concern.
Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?
Herbs and supplements that might lower blood sugar
Capsicum might lower blood sugar. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might lower blood sugar too much. Examples of supplements with this effect include aloe, bitter melon, cassia cinnamon, chromium, and prickly pear cactus.
Herbs and supplements that might slow blood clotting
Capsicum might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding. Taking it with other supplements with similar effects might increase the risk of bleeding in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include garlic, ginger, ginkgo, nattokinase, and Panax ginseng.
Iron
There is some concern that using capsicum might reduce how much iron the body can absorb.
Are there interactions with foods?
There are no known interactions with foods.
How is it typically used?
In adults, capsicum has been taken by mouth as extracts, chili, fermented red pepper, red pepper powder, lozenges, nectar, and capsaicin. In both adults and children, capsicum has been applied to the skin in creams, plasters, and gels. It's also used in nasal sprays and solutions. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what type of product and dose might be best for a specific condition.

Creatine is a chemical found naturally in the body. It's also in red meat and seafood. It is often used to improve exercise performance and muscle mass.
Creatine is involved in making energy for muscles. About 95% of it is found in skeletal muscle. The majority of sports supplements in the US contain creatine. People who have lower creatine levels when they start taking creatine seem to get more benefit than people who start with higher levels.
People commonly use creatine for improving exercise performance and increasing muscle mass. It is also used for muscle cramps, fatigue, multiple sclerosis (MS), depression, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.
Creatine use is allowed by the International Olympic Committee and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).
How effective is it?
Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database
rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.
The effectiveness ratings for
CREATINE
are as follows:
Possibly effective for...
Athletic performance
. Taking creatine by mouth seems to somewhat improve rowing, jumping, and soccer performance. It's not clear if it helps with sprinting, cycling, swimming, or tennis.
Disorders of creatine metabolism or transport
. Taking creatine by mouth daily can increase creatine levels in the brain in children and young adults with conditions called GAMT deficiency or AGAT deficiency. But taking creatine doesn't seem to improve brain creatine levels in children who have a disorder in which creatine isn't transported properly.
Muscle strength
. Taking creatine by mouth seems to somewhat improve muscle strength in both younger and older adults. It's not clear if applying creatine to the skin helps.
Age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia)
. Taking creatine by mouth for up to 12 weeks seems to improve muscle strength in older adults. It seems to work best when used along with exercise to build muscles.
Possibly ineffective for...
Lou Gehrig disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS)
. Taking creatine by mouth does not seem to slow disease progression or improve survival in people with ALS.
An inherited brain disorder that affects movements, emotions, and thinking (Huntington disease)
. Taking creatine by mouth does not improve symptoms in people with Huntington disease.
Low bone mass (osteopenia)
. Taking creatine by mouth doesn't seem to slow or reduce bone loss in people with osteopenia.
There is interest in using creatine for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.

Hops are the dried, flowering parts of the hop plant (Humulus lupulus), commonly used in brewing beer. They have limited evidence of health benefits.
The term "hops" comes from the Anglo-Saxon term "hoppan", which means "to climb." Hops contain many chemicals, including bitter acids, which contribute to its bitter flavor. Some chemicals in hops seem to act similarly to the hormone estrogen and some seem to cause sleepiness.
People commonly use hops for anxiety, sleep disorders, restlessness, symptoms of menopause, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
How effective is it?
There is interest in using hops for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
:

Hops are commonly consumed in foods. Hops extracts and hops bitter acids are possibly safe when used short-term. Hops extracts have been used safely in doses of up to 300 mg daily for up to 3 months. Hops bitter acids have been used safely in doses of 35 mg daily for 3 months. Hops might cause dizziness and sleepiness in some people.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if hops are safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Hormone sensitive cancers and conditions
: Some chemicals in hops act like the hormone estrogen. People who have conditions that are sensitive to estrogen should use caution when taking hops. Some of these conditions include breast cancer and endometriosis.
Surgery
: Hops might cause too much sleepiness when combined with anesthesia and other medications during and after surgical procedures. Stop taking hops at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.
Are there interactions with medications?
Moderate
Be cautious with this combination.
Estrogens
Hops might have some of the same effects as estrogen. Taking hops along with estrogen might decrease the effects of estrogen.
Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) substrates)
Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Hops might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.
Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates)
Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Hops might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.
Sedative medications (CNS depressants)
Hops might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Some medications, called sedatives, can also cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking hops with sedative medications might cause breathing problems and/or too much sleepiness.
Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?
Herbs and supplements with sedative properties
Hops might cause sleepiness and slowed breathing. Taking it along with other supplements with similar effects might cause too much sleepiness and/or slowed breathing in some people. Examples of supplements with this effect include kava, L-tryptophan, melatonin, and valerian.
Herbs that might act like estrogen
Hops might have the same effects as estrogen. Using it along with other supplements with similar effects might increase estrogen-like effects and side effects. Examples of supplements with this effect include black cohosh, kudzu, peony, and red clover.
Are there interactions with foods?
There are no known interactions with foods.
How is it typically used?
Hops are available in many different types of products, including beverages, tablets, capsules, creams, and gels. There isn't enough reliable information to know what an appropriate dose of hops might be. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult a healthcare professional before using.

Chondroitin sulfate is a chemical found in human and animal cartilage. It is commonly used by mouth with glucosamine or other ingredients for osteoarthritis.
Chondroitin sulfate is one of the building blocks of cartilage. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage in the joints breaks down. Taking chondroitin sulfate might slow this breakdown. It is usually manufactured from animal sources, such as shark and cow cartilage. It can also be made in a lab.
Chondroitin sulfate is used for osteoarthritis and cataracts. It is often used together with other ingredients, including manganese ascorbate, hyaluronic acid, collagen peptides, or glucosamine. Chondroitin sulfate is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
How effective is it?
Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database
rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.
The effectiveness ratings for
CHONDROITIN SULFATE
are as follows:
Possibly effective for...
Cataracts
. An injectable solution containing chondroitin sulfate and sodium hyaluronate is approved by the FDA to protect the eye during cataract surgery. It is not clear if using it in a different form will help.
Osteoarthritis
. Taking chondroitin sulfate by mouth seems to provide some relief from osteoarthritis pain and improve function. High quality, pharmaceutical-grade products have shown the most benefit. Chondrosulf (IBSA Institut Biochimique SA), Chondrosan (Bioiberica, S.A.) and Structum (Laboratoires Pierre Fabre) are examples of these products.
There is interest in using chondroitin sulfate for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Chondroitin sulfate is likely safe when used for up to 6 years. It can cause some mild stomach pain and nausea. Other possible side effects include bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.
When placed into the eye
: Chondroitin sulfate is possibly safe when used together with other ingredients in an eye drop.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
: There isn't enough reliable information to know if chondroitin sulfate is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Asthma
: There is some concern that chondroitin sulfate might make asthma worse. If you have asthma, use chondroitin sulfate cautiously.
Prostate cancer
: Early research suggests that chondroitin might cause the spread or recurrence of prostate cancer. This effect has not been shown with chondroitin sulfate supplements. However, until more is known, do not take chondroitin sulfate if you have prostate cancer or are at high risk for developing it (you have a brother or father with prostate cancer).
Are there interactions with medications?
Moderate
Be cautious with this combination.
Warfarin (Coumadin)
Warfarin is used to slow blood clotting. There are several reports showing that taking chondroitin with glucosamine increases the effects of warfarin. This can cause bruising and bleeding that can be serious. Don't take chondroitin if you are taking warfarin.
Are there interactions with herbs and supplements?
Glucosamine
Taking chondroitin sulfate together with glucosamine hydrochloride might reduce blood levels of glucosamine. But it's not clear if this will change the effects of glucosamine hydrochloride. It's also not clear if this interaction occurs with other forms of glucosamine, such as glucosamine sulfate.
Are there interactions with foods?
There are no known interactions with foods.
How is it typically used?
Chondroitin sulfate is most commonly used by adults in doses of 800-1200 mg per day, for up to 2 years.
There is concern that some chondroitin sulfate products are not labeled accurately. Some products might contain no chondroitin, while other products might contain more than the amount stated on the product's label.

Spearmint (Mentha spicata) is a species of mint plant. It's grown for its leaves and essential oil, which is used as a flavoring in foods and cosmetics.
Spearmint oil contains chemicals that reduce swelling and affect hormone levels in the body, including testosterone. Some chemicals might also harm cancer cells and kill bacteria.
People use spearmint for memory, digestion, osteoarthritis, nausea and vomiting after surgery, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
Don't confuse spearmint with other plants known as mint, including English horsemint, Japanese mint, peppermint, perilla, salvia divinorum, or wild mint. These are not the same.
How effective is it?
There is interest in using spearmint for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.
Is it safe?
When taken by mouth
: Spearmint and spearmint oil are commonly consumed in foods. Spearmint is possibly safe when used as a medicine, short-term. It's usually well tolerated.
When applied to the skin
: Spearmint is possibly safe. It might cause an allergic reaction in some people, but this is rare.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy
: Spearmint and spearmint oil are commonly consumed in foods. But spearmint is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in large amounts during pregnancy. Very large doses of spearmint tea might damage the uterus. Avoid using large amounts of spearmint during pregnancy.

General Information About Chronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
Key Points
Myeloproliferative neoplasms are a group of diseases in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets.
There are 6 types of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Myeloproliferative neoplasms are a group of diseases in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets.
Normally, the
bone marrow
makes
blood stem cells
(immature
cells
) that become mature
blood
cells over time.
Enlarge
Anatomy of the bone. The bone is made up of compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Compact bone makes up the outer layer of the bone. Spongy bone is found mostly at the ends of bones and contains red marrow. Bone marrow is found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. There are two types of bone marrow: red and yellow. Red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Yellow marrow is made mostly of fat.
A blood stem cell may become a
myeloid
stem cell
or a
lymphoid
stem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a
white blood cell
. A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:
Red blood cells
that carry
oxygen
and other substances to all
tissues
of the body.
Granulocytes
, which are white blood cells that help fight
infection
and disease.
Platelets
that form
blood clots
to stop bleeding.
Enlarge
Blood cell development. A blood stem cell goes through several steps to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell.
In
myeloproliferative neoplasms
,  too many blood stem cells become one or more types of  blood cells. The neoplasms usually get worse slowly as the number of extra blood cells increases.
There are 6 types of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.
The type of  myeloproliferative neoplasm is based on whether too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are being made.  Sometimes the body will make too many of more than one type of blood cell, but usually one type of blood cell is affected more than the others are.
Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms
include the following 6 types:
Chronic myelogenous leukemia
.
Polycythemia vera
.
Primary myelofibrosis
(also called chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis).
Essential thrombocythemia
.
Chronic neutrophilic leukemia
.
Chronic eosinophilic leukemia
.
These types are described below.  Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms sometimes become
acute leukemia
, in which too many
abnormal
white blood cells are made.
Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.
The following tests and procedures may be used:
Physical exam
and
health history
:  An exam of the body to check general
signs
of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
Complete blood count (CBC) with differential
: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:
The number of red blood cells and platelets.
The number and type of white blood cells.
The amount of
hemoglobin
(the
protein
that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.
The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.
Enlarge
Complete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.
Peripheral blood smear
: A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for the following:
Whether there are  red blood cells shaped like teardrops.
The number and kinds of white blood cells.
The number of platelets.
Whether there are
blast
cells.
Blood chemistry studies
:  A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by
organs
and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy
: The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or
breastbone
. A
pathologist
views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a
microscope
to look for abnormal cells.
Enlarge
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After  a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle is inserted into the patient’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow   are removed for examination under a microscope.
Cytogenetic analysis
: A
laboratory test
in which the
chromosomes
of cells in a sample of bone marrow or blood are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of
cancer
. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help
diagnose
cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.
Gene
mutation
test
:  A laboratory test done on a bone marrow or blood sample to check for mutations in
JAK2
,
MPL
, or
CALR
genes. A
JAK2
gene mutation is often found in patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, or primary myelofibrosis.
MPL
or
CALR
gene mutations are found in patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis.
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
Chronic myelogenous leukemia
is a disease in which too many
white blood cells
are made in the
bone marrow
. See the
PDQ
summary on
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment
for information on
diagnosis
,
staging
, and treatment.
Polycythemia Vera
Key Points
Polycythemia vera is a disease in which too many red blood cells are made in the bone marrow.
Symptoms of polycythemia vera include headaches and a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side.
Special blood tests are used to diagnose polycythemia vera.
Polycythemia vera is a disease in which too many red blood cells are made in the bone marrow.
In
polycythemia vera
, the
blood
becomes thickened with too many
red blood cells
. The number of
white blood cells
and
platelets
may also increase. These extra blood
cells
may collect in the
spleen
and cause it to swell.  The increased number of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets in the blood can cause bleeding problems and make clots form in
blood vessels
. This can increase the risk of
stroke
or heart attack.  In patients who are older than 65 years or who have a
history
of
blood clots
, the risk of stroke or heart attack  is higher. Patients also have an increased risk of
acute myeloid leukemia
or
primary myelofibrosis
.
Symptoms of polycythemia vera include headaches and a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side.
Polycythemia vera often does not cause early
signs
or
symptoms
. It may be found during a routine
blood test
. Signs and symptoms may occur as the number of blood cells increases. Other
conditions
may cause the same signs and symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:
A feeling of pressure or fullness below the ribs on the left side.
Headaches.
Double vision or seeing dark or blind spots that come and go.
Itching all over the body, especially after being in warm or hot water.
Reddened face that looks like a blush or sunburn.
Weakness.
Dizziness.
Weight loss for no known reason.
Special blood tests are used to diagnose polycythemia vera.
In addition to a
complete blood count
,
bone marrow aspiration and biopsy
, and
cytogenetic analysis
, a
serum
erythropoietin
test is used to
diagnose
polycythemia vera. In this test, a sample of blood is checked for the level of erythropoietin (a
hormone
that stimulates new red blood cells to be made). In polycythemia vera, the erythropoietin level would be lower than normal because the body does not need to make more red blood cells.
Primary Myelofibrosis
Key Points
Primary myelofibrosis is a disease in which abnormal blood cells and fibers build up inside the bone marrow.
Symptoms of primary myelofibrosis include pain below the ribs on the left side and feeling very tired.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for  primary myelofibrosis.
Primary myelofibrosis is a disease in which abnormal blood cells and fibers build up inside the bone marrow.
The
bone marrow
is made of
tissues
that make
blood
cells
(
red blood cells
,
white blood cells
, and
platelets
) and a web of fibers that support the blood-forming tissues.  In
primary myelofibrosis
(also called chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), large numbers of
blood stem cells
become blood cells that do not mature properly (
blasts
). The web of fibers inside the bone marrow also becomes very thick (like
scar tissue
) and slows the blood-forming tissue’s ability to make blood cells.  This causes the blood-forming tissues to make fewer and fewer blood cells.  In order to make up for the low number of blood cells made in the bone marrow, the
liver
and
spleen
begin to make the blood cells.
Symptoms of primary myelofibrosis include pain below the ribs on the left side and feeling very tired.
Primary myelofibrosis often does not cause early
signs
or
symptoms
. It may be found during a routine
blood test
. Signs and symptoms may be caused by primary myelofibrosis or by other
conditions
. Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:
Feeling pain or fullness below the ribs on the left side.
Feeling full sooner than normal when eating.
Feeling very tired.
Shortness of breath.
Easy bruising or bleeding.
Petechiae
(flat, red, pinpoint spots under the skin that are caused by bleeding).
Fever
.
Drenching night sweats.
Weight loss.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for  primary myelofibrosis.
Prognosis
depends on the following:
The age of the patient.
The number of
abnormal
red blood cells and white blood cells.
The number of blasts in the blood.
Whether there are certain changes in the
chromosomes
.
Whether the patient has signs such as fever, drenching night sweats, or weight loss.
Essential Thrombocythemia
Key Points
Essential thrombocythemia is a disease in which too many platelets are made in the bone marrow.
Patients with essential thrombocythemia may have no signs or symptoms.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for essential thrombocythemia.
Essential thrombocythemia is a disease in which too many platelets are made in the bone marrow.
Essential thrombocythemia
causes an
abnormal
increase in the number of
platelets
made in the
blood
and
bone marrow
.
Patients with essential thrombocythemia may have no signs or symptoms.
Essential thrombocythemia often does not cause early
signs
or
symptoms
. It may be found during a routine
blood test
. Signs and symptoms may be caused by essential thrombocythemia or by other
conditions
.  Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:
Headache.
Burning or tingling in the hands or feet.
Redness and warmth of the hands or feet.
Vision or hearing problems.
Platelets are sticky. When there are too many platelets, they may clump together and make it hard for the blood to flow.  Clots may form in
blood vessels
and there may also be increased bleeding. These can cause serious health problems such as
stroke
or heart attack.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for essential thrombocythemia.
Prognosis
and treatment options depend on the following:
The age of the patient.
Whether the patient has signs or symptoms or other problems related to essential thrombocythemia.
Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia
Chronic neutrophilic leukemia
is a disease in which too many
blood stem cells
become a type of
white blood cell
called
neutrophils
. Neutrophils are
infection
-fighting
blood
cells
that surround and destroy dead cells and
foreign
substances (such as
bacteria
). The
spleen
and
liver
may swell because of the extra neutrophils. Chronic neutrophilic leukemia may stay the same or it may
progress
quickly to
acute leukemia
.
Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia
Key Points
Chronic eosinophilic leukemia is a disease in which  too many white blood cells (eosinophils) are made in the bone marrow.
Signs and symptoms of chronic eosinophilic leukemia include fever and feeling very tired.
Chronic eosinophilic leukemia is a disease in which  too many white blood cells (eosinophils) are made in the bone marrow.
Eosinophils
are
white blood cells
that react to allergens (substances that cause an
allergic response
) and help fight
infections
caused by certain
parasites
. In
chronic eosinophilic leukemia
, there are too many eosinophils in the
blood
,
bone marrow
, and other
tissues
. Chronic eosinophilic leukemia may stay the same for many years or it may
progress
quickly to
acute leukemia
.
Signs and symptoms of chronic eosinophilic leukemia include fever and feeling very tired.
Chronic eosinophilic leukemia may not cause early
signs
or
symptoms

Stages of Chronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
Key Points
There is no standard staging system for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.
There is no standard staging system for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.
The process used to find out if
cancer
has spread to other parts of the body is called
staging
. There is no standard
staging system
for
chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms
.  It
		  is important to know the type of myeloproliferative neoplasm in order to plan treatment.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Eleven types of standard treatment are used:
Watchful waiting
Phlebotomy
Platelet apheresis
Transfusion therapy
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Other drug therapy
Surgery
Immunotherapy
Targeted therapy
High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Treatment for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Different types of treatments are available for patients with
chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms
. Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
. A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Eleven types of standard treatment are used:
Watchful waiting
Watchful waiting
is closely
monitoring
a patient’s
condition
without giving any treatment until
signs
or
symptoms
appear or change.
Phlebotomy
Phlebotomy
is a procedure in which
blood
is taken from a
vein
. A sample of blood may be taken  for tests such as a
CBC
or
blood chemistry
. Sometimes phlebotomy is used as a treatment and blood is taken from the body to remove extra
red blood cells
. Phlebotomy is used in this way to treat some chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Platelet apheresis
Platelet
apheresis
is a treatment that uses a special machine to remove platelets from the blood. Blood is taken from the patient and put through a blood
cell
separator where the platelets are removed. The rest of the blood is then returned to the patient’s bloodstream.
Transfusion therapy
Transfusion
therapy
(
blood transfusion
) is a method of giving red blood cells,
white blood cells
, or platelets to replace blood cells destroyed by disease or
cancer
treatment.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them  from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
See
Drugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
for more information.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy
is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body, such as the
spleen
, with cancer.
Other drug therapy
Prednisone
and
danazol
are drugs that may be used to treat
anemia
in patients with
primary myelofibrosis
.
Anagrelide
therapy is used to reduce the risk of
blood clots
in patients who have too many platelets in 
their blood. Low-
dose
aspirin
may also be used to reduce the risk of blood clots.
Thalidomide
,
lenalidomide
, and
pomalidomide
are drugs that prevent
blood vessels
from growing into areas of
tumor
cells.
Erythropoietic
growth factors
are used to stimulate the
bone marrow
to make red blood cells.
See
Drugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
for more information.
Surgery
Splenectomy
(
surgery
to remove the spleen) may be done if the spleen is enlarged.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy
is a treatment that uses the patient's
immune system
to fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.  This cancer treatment is a type of
biologic therapy
.
Interferon: Interferon affects the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth.
Interferon alfa
and
pegylated interferon alpha
are commonly used to treat certain chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) therapy: TKI therapy blocks signals that cancer cells need to grow.
Ruxolitinib
is used to treat
polycythemia vera
and certain types of
myelofibrosis
.
See
Drugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
for more information.
Other types of targeted therapies are being studied in clinical trials.
High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant
High doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.
Stem cell transplant
is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.
Stem cells
(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a
donor
and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an
infusion
. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.
Enlarge
Donor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Treatment for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms may cause side effects.
For information about
side effects
caused by treatment for cancer, visit our
Side Effects
page.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

General Information About Ewing Sarcoma
Key Points
Ewing sarcoma is a type of tumor that forms from a certain kind of cell in bone or soft tissue.
Undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma may also form in the bone or soft tissue.
A genetic condition may increase the risk of Ewing sarcoma and other sarcomas.
Signs and symptoms of Ewing sarcoma include swelling and pain near the tumor.
Tests that examine the bone and soft tissue are used to diagnose and stage Ewing sarcoma.
A biopsy is done to diagnose Ewing sarcoma.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).
Ewing sarcoma is a type of tumor that forms from a certain kind of cell in bone or soft tissue.
Ewing sarcoma
most often forms in the bones of the legs, arms, feet, hands,
chest
,
pelvis
,
spine
, or
skull
. Less often, it forms in the soft tissue of the
trunk
, arms, legs, head, neck,
retroperitoneum
(area in the back of the
abdomen
behind the
tissue
that lines the abdominal wall and covers most of the
organs
in the abdomen), or other areas.
Ewing sarcoma is most common in adolescents and young adults (teens through mid-20s).
Ewing sarcoma has also been called peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor, Askin tumor (Ewing sarcoma of the chest wall),
extraosseous
Ewing sarcoma (Ewing sarcoma in tissue other than bone), and
Ewing sarcoma family of tumors
.
Undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma may also form in the bone or soft tissue.
Undifferentiated
small round cell sarcoma usually forms in the bones or the muscles that are attached to bones and that help the body move. There are five types of undifferentiated small round cell  sarcoma that are treated like Ewing sarcoma:
Undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma with
BCOR
rearrangements.
This type of bone tumor usually forms in the pelvis, arms, or legs. It may spread to other parts of the body. This type of bone tumor is more common in children younger than 18 years. In this type of round cell sarcoma, the
BCOR
gene
is joined to the
CCNB3
gene or to other genes. To
diagnose
this small round cell sarcoma, the tumor cells are checked for these gene changes.
Undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma with
CIC::DUX4
rearrangements.
This type of soft tissue tumor usually forms in the
trunk
, arms, or legs. It is most common in males and in young adults between 21 and 40 years of age. In this type of small round cell sarcoma, the
CIC
gene is joined to the
DUX4
gene. To diagnose this small round cell sarcoma, the tumor cells are checked for this gene change.
Undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma with
CIC::NUTM1
rearrangements.
This type of soft tissue tumor usually forms in the
central nervous system
, but it can also form in the trunk. It is most common in younger patients.
Undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma with
EWSR1::NFATC2
and
FUS::NFATC2
rearrangements.
This type of soft tissue tumor may be a
benign
cyst
or a
malignant
(cancer) tumor. It usually forms in the arms and legs. The malignant tumor is more common in males and in adults.
Undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma with
EWSR1::PATZ1
fusions.
This type of soft tissue tumor usually forms in the trunk and is more common in adults.
A genetic condition may increase the risk of Ewing sarcoma and other sarcomas.
Anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a
risk factor
. Not every child with one or more of these risk factors will develop Ewing sarcoma or other sarcomas, and they can develop in some children who don't have any known risk factors. Children with
Fanconi anemia
may be at increased risk for Ewing sarcoma. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.
Signs and symptoms of Ewing sarcoma include swelling and pain near the tumor.
These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by Ewing sarcoma or by other
conditions
.
		  Check with your child’s doctor if they have any of the following:
A lump (which may feel soft and warm) in the arms, legs, chest, or pelvis.
Pain and/or swelling near the lump.
Fever
for no known reason.
A bone that breaks for no known reason.
Tests that examine the bone and soft tissue are used to diagnose and stage Ewing sarcoma.
Procedures that make pictures of the bones and soft tissues and nearby areas help diagnose Ewing sarcoma and show how far the
cancer
has spread. The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the bones and soft tissues or to other parts of the body is called
staging
.
To plan treatment, it is important to know whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and
stage
Ewing sarcoma are usually done at the same time.
In addition to asking about your child's
personal
and
family health history
and doing a
physical exam
, your child's doctor may perform the following tests and procedures to diagnose or stage Ewing sarcoma:
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the area where the tumor formed. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
Enlarge
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.
CT scan
(CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the area where the tumor formed or the chest, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Enlarge
Computed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.
PET-CT scan
: A procedure that combines the pictures from a
PET scan
and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself.
Enlarge
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the PET scanner. The head rest and white strap help the child lie still.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the child's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body.  Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Bone scan
: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of
radioactive
material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.
Enlarge
Bone scan.  A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the child's vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive material collects in the bones. As the child lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen.
Bone marrow aspiration
and
biopsy
: The removal of
bone marrow
and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone. Samples are removed from both hipbones. A
pathologist
views the bone marrow and bone under a
microscope
to see if the cancer has spread.
Enlarge
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.
X-ray
: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body, such as the chest or the area where the tumor formed.
Complete blood count
(CBC)
: A procedure in which a sample of
blood
is drawn and checked for the following:
The number of
red blood cells
,
white blood cells
, and
platelets
.
The amount of
hemoglobin
(the
protein
that carries
oxygen
) in the red blood cells.
The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.

: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as
lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.
A biopsy is done to diagnose Ewing sarcoma.
Tissue samples are removed during a biopsy so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. It is helpful if the biopsy is done at the same center where treatment will be given. The following types of biopsy are used to diagnose Ewing sarcoma:
Incisional biopsy
: For an incisional biopsy, a sample of tissue is removed through an
incision
in the skin.
Needle biopsy
: For this biopsy, a sample of tissue is removed using a needle.
The
specialists
(pathologist,
radiation oncologist
, and
surgeon
) who will treat the patient usually work together to decide the best site to place the needle or biopsy incision. The selection of the biopsy site is important. A biopsy site that is not properly selected may result in more extensive
surgery
to remove the tumor or a larger area that is treated with
radiation therapy
.
If there is a chance that the cancer has spread to nearby
lymph nodes
, one or more lymph nodes may be removed and checked for signs of cancer.
The following tests may be done on the tissue that is removed:
Cytogenetic analysis
: A
laboratory test
in which the
chromosomes
of cells in a sample of tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.
Immunohistochemistry
: A laboratory test that uses
antibodies
to check for certain
antigens
(
markers
) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an
enzyme
or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.
Flow cytometry
: A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of the cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor (or other)
markers
on the cell surface. The cells from a sample of a patient's blood, bone marrow, or other tissue are stained with a fluorescent dye, placed in a
fluid
, and then passed one at a time through a beam of light. The test results are based on how the cells that were stained with the fluorescent dye react to the beam of light.
Molecular test
: A laboratory test to check for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules in a sample of tissue, blood, or other body fluid. A molecular test may be done with other procedures, such as biopsies, to help diagnose some types of cancer. Molecular tests check for certain gene or chromosome changes that occur in some Ewing sarcomas.
Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (
RT–PCR
) test
: A laboratory test in which the amount of a
genetic
substance called
mRNA
made by a specific gene is measured. An enzyme called reverse transcriptase is used to convert a specific piece of
RNA
into a matching piece of
DNA
, which can be amplified (made in large numbers) by another enzyme called DNA polymerase. The amplified DNA copies help tell whether a specific mRNA is being made by a gene. RT–PCR can be used to check the activation of certain genes that may indicate the presence of cancer cells. This test may be used to look for certain changes in a gene or
chromosome
, which may help diagnose cancer.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).
The factors that affect
prognosis
are different before and after treatment.
Before any treatment is given, prognosis depends on:
Where in the body the tumor started.
Whether the tumor formed in the bone or in soft tissue.
Whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or distant parts of the body.
How large the tumor is when the tumor is diagnosed.
Whether the LDH level in the blood is higher than normal.
Whether the tumor has certain gene changes.
Whether tumor
DNA
has been found in the blood.
The patient's age.
The patient's sex.
Whether the patient has had treatment for a different  cancer.
Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has
recurred
(come back).
After treatment is given, prognosis is affected by:
Whether the tumor was completely removed by surgery.
Whether the tumor
responded
to
chemotherapy
or radiation therapy.
If the cancer recurs after initial treatment, prognosis depends on:
Whether the cancer came back more than two years after the initial treatment.
Whether the cancer came back where it first formed and in other parts of the body, or whether the cancer came back in only one site.
Stages of Ewing Sarcoma
Key Points
After Ewing sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
Ewing sarcoma is described as localized, metastatic, or recurrent.
Localized Ewing sarcoma
Metastatic Ewing sarcoma
Recurrent Ewing sarcoma
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
After Ewing sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
The process used to find out if
cancer
has spread from where it began to other parts of the body is called
staging
. There is no standard
staging system
for
Ewing sarcoma
. The results of the
tests and procedures
done to
diagnose
and
stage
Ewing sarcoma are used to help make decisions about treatment.  Treatment is based on whether the cancer is
localized
,
metastatic
, or
recurrent
.
Ewing sarcoma is described as localized, metastatic, or recurrent.
Localized Ewing sarcoma
The
cancer
is found in  the bone or
soft tissue
where it began and may have  spread to nearby
tissue
, including nearby
lymph nodes
.
Metastatic Ewing sarcoma
The
cancer
has spread from the bone or soft tissue where it began to other parts of the body. In Ewing tumor of bone, the cancer most often spreads to the
lung
, other bones, and
bone marrow
.
Recurrent Ewing sarcoma
The cancer has
recurred
(come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the bone or soft tissue where it began or in another part of the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called
metastasis
. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the
primary tumor
) and travel through the lymph system or blood.
Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a
tumor
(
metastatic
tumor) in another part of the body.
Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the
primary tumor
. For example, if  Ewing sarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually Ewing sarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic Ewing sarcoma, not
lung cancer
.
Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for children with Ewing sarcoma.
Children with Ewing sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of            health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
Four types of treatment are used:
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Surgery
High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Immunotherapy
Treatment for Ewing sarcoma may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for children with Ewing sarcoma.
Different types of treatments are available for children with
Ewing sarcoma
. Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
.  A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with
cancer
. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children and adolescents is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Children with Ewing sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of            health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
Treatment will be overseen by a
pediatric oncologist
, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other
health care providers
who are experts in treating children with Ewing sarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of
medicine
. These may include the following
specialists
:
Pediatrician
.
Surgical oncologist
or orthopedic
oncologist
.
Radiation oncologist
.
Pediatric nurse specialist
.
Social worker
.
Rehabilitation specialist
.
Psychologist
.
Four types of treatment are used:
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer
cells
, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
Combination chemotherapy
is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.
Systemic combination chemotherapy is part of the treatment for all patients with Ewing
tumors
. It is often the first treatment given and lasts for about 6 to 12 months. Chemotherapy is often given to shrink the tumor before
surgery
or
radiation therapy
and to kill any tumor cells that may have spread to other parts of the body.
For more information, see
Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma
.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
Radiation therapy is used when the tumor cannot be removed by surgery or when surgery to remove the tumor will affect important body functions or the way the child will look. It may be used to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of
tissue
that needs to be removed during surgery. It may also be used to treat any tumor that remains after surgery and tumors that have spread to other parts of the body.
Radiation therapy may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms caused by the tumor in the bone.
Surgery
Surgery is usually done to remove cancer that is left after chemotherapy or radiation therapy. When possible, the whole tumor is removed by surgery.
Tissue
and bone that are removed may be replaced with a
graft
, which uses tissue and bone taken from another part of the patient's body or a
donor
. Sometimes an
implant
, such as artificial bone, is used.
After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called
adjuvant therapy
.
High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue
High
doses
of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including
blood
-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.
Stem cell transplant
is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.
Stem cells
(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or
bone marrow
of the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an
infusion
. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. Chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is used to treat
localized
and
recurrent
Ewing sarcoma.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy
helps a person's immune system fight cancer. Types of immunotherapy include:
CAR T-cell therapy
:
This treatment changes the patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special
receptors
are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied to treat recurrent Ewing sarcoma.
Enlarge
CAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient’s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient’s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.
Treatment for Ewing sarcoma may cause side effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called
late effects
. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:
Physical problems.
Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.
Second cancers
(new types of cancer). Patients treated for Ewing sarcoma have an increased risk of
acute myeloid leukemia
and
myelodysplastic syndrome
. There is also an increased risk of
sarcoma
in the area treated with radiation therapy.
Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. For more information, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

#Question#: What is the outlook for Ewing Sarcoma ?
#Answer#: The outlook for Ewing sarcoma depends on various factors such as whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or distant parts of the body, where in the body the tumor started, whether the tumor formed in bone or soft tissue, how large the tumor is at diagnosis, whether the LDH level in the blood is higher than normal, whether the tumor has certain gene changes, whether the child is younger than 15 years, the patient's gender, whether the child has had treatment for a different cancer before Ewing sarcoma, and whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back). After treatment, prognosis is affected by whether the tumor was completely removed by surgery and whether it responds to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. If the cancer recurs after initial treatment, the outlook depends on whether it came back more than two years after the initial treatment, where in the body the tumor came back, and the type of initial treatment given. In fact, Ewing sarcoma is curable in most patients with early-stage disease, and the prognosis is generally favorable for those who receive aggressive multimodal therapy.

General Information About Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors
Key Points
Childhood kidney tumors are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the kidney.
There are many types of childhood kidney tumors.
Wilms Tumor
Renal Cell Cancer (RCC)
Rhabdoid Tumor of the Kidney
Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney
Congenital Mesoblastic Nephroma
Ewing Sarcoma of the Kidney
Primary Renal Myoepithelial Carcinoma
Cystic Partially Differentiated Nephroblastoma
Multilocular Cystic Nephroma
Primary Renal Synovial Sarcoma
Anaplastic Sarcoma of the Kidney
Nephroblastomatosis is not cancer but may become Wilms tumor.
Having certain genetic syndromes,  other conditions, or environmental exposures can  increase the risk of Wilms tumor.
Tests are used to screen for Wilms tumor.
Having certain conditions may increase the risk of renal cell cancer.
Treatment for Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may include genetic counseling.
Signs of Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors  include a lump in the abdomen and blood in the urine.
Tests that examine the kidney and the blood are used to diagnose Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
Childhood kidney tumors are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the kidney.
There are two
kidneys
, one on each side of the
spine
, above the waist. Tiny tubules in the kidneys
filter
and clean the
blood
. They take out waste products and make
urine
. The urine passes from each kidney through a long tube called a
ureter
into the
bladder
. The bladder holds the urine until it passes through the
urethra
and leaves the body.
Enlarge

Also shown is the spine and adrenal glands. Urine is made in the renal tubules and collects in the renal pelvis of each kidney. The urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters to the bladder. The urine is stored in the bladder until it leaves the body through the urethra.
There are many types of childhood kidney tumors.
Wilms Tumor
In
Wilms tumor
, one or more
tumors
may be found in one or both kidneys. Wilms tumor may spread to the
lungs
,
liver
, bone, brain, or nearby
lymph nodes
. In children and adolescents younger than 15 years old, most
kidney cancers
are Wilms tumors.
Renal Cell Cancer (RCC)
Renal cell cancer
is rare in children  and adolescents younger than 15 years old. It is much more common in adolescents between 15 and 19 years old. Children and adolescents are more likely to be
diagnosed
with a large renal cell tumor or cancer that has  spread. Renal cell cancers may spread to the lungs, liver, bone, or lymph nodes. Renal cell cancer may also be called renal cell carcinoma.
Rhabdoid Tumor of the Kidney
Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney
is a type of kidney cancer that occurs mostly in infants and young children. It is often
advanced
at the time of diagnosis. Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney grows and spreads quickly, often  to the lungs or  brain.
Children with a certain change in the
SMARCB1
gene
can also have tumors grow in the kidney, brain, or
soft tissues
. These children are checked regularly to see if a rhabdoid tumor has formed in the kidney or the brain:
Children from birth or
diagnosis
to 5 years old have an
MRI
of the brain and
spine
and an
ultrasound of the abdomen
every 3 months.
Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney
Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney
is an uncommon kidney  cancer that may  spread to the bone, lungs, brain, liver, or soft tissue.  It occurs most often before age 3 years.  It may
recur
(come back) up to 14 years after treatment, often in the brain or lung.
Congenital Mesoblastic Nephroma
Congenital mesoblastic nephroma
is a tumor of the kidney that is often diagnosed during the first year of life or before birth. It is the most common kidney tumor found in infants younger than 6 months old and is found more often in males than in females. It can usually be
cured
.
Ewing Sarcoma of the Kidney
Ewing sarcoma
(previously called
neuroepithelial
tumor) of the kidney is rare and usually occurs in young adults. This cancer grows and spreads to other parts of the body quickly.
Primary Renal Myoepithelial Carcinoma
Primary renal myoepithelial carcinoma
is a rare type of
cancer
that usually affects soft tissues, but sometimes forms in the internal
organs
(such as the kidney).  This type of cancer grows and spreads quickly.
Cystic Partially Differentiated Nephroblastoma
Cystic
partially
differentiated
nephroblastoma is a very rare type of Wilms tumor  made up     of cysts.
Multilocular Cystic Nephroma
Multilocular cystic nephromas are
benign
tumors made up of cysts and are most common in infants, young children, and adult women. These tumors can occur in one or both kidneys.
Children with this type of tumor also may have
pleuropulmonary blastoma
, so
imaging tests
that check the lungs for cysts or
solid tumors
are done. Since multilocular cystic nephroma may be an
inherited
condition
,
genetic counseling
and
genetic testing
may be considered. See the PDQ summary about
Childhood Pleuropulmonary Blastoma Treatment
for more information.
Primary Renal Synovial Sarcoma
Primary
renal synovial sarcoma is a cyst-like tumor of the kidney and is most common in young adults. These tumors grow and spread quickly.
Anaplastic Sarcoma of the Kidney
Anaplastic
sarcoma
of the kidney is a rare tumor that is most common in children or adolescents younger than 15 years of age. Anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney often spreads to the lungs, liver, or bones. Imaging tests that check the lungs for cysts or solid tumors may be done. Since anaplastic sarcoma may be  an inherited condition, genetic counseling and genetic testing may be considered.
Nephroblastomatosis is not cancer but may become Wilms tumor.
Sometimes, after the kidneys form in the
fetus
,
abnormal
groups of   kidney cells remain in one or both kidneys.  In nephroblastomatosis (
diffuse hyperplastic perilobar nephroblastomatosis
), these abnormal groups of cells may grow in many places inside the kidney  or make a thick layer around the  kidney.  When these groups of abnormal cells are found  in a kidney after it was removed for Wilms tumor, the child has an increased risk of Wilms tumor in the other kidney. Frequent
follow-up
testing is important at least every 3 months, for at least 7 years after the child is     diagnosed or treated.
Having certain genetic syndromes,  other conditions, or environmental exposures can  increase the risk of Wilms tumor.
Anything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a
risk factor
. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.
Wilms tumor may be part of a
genetic
syndrome
that affects  growth or development. A genetic syndrome is a set of
signs
and
symptoms
or conditions that occur together and is caused by certain changes in the genes. Certain conditions or
environmental exposures
can also increase a child's risk of developing Wilms tumor. The following have been linked to Wilms tumor:
WAGR syndrome
(Wilms tumor,
aniridia
, abnormal
genitourinary system
, and mental disability).
Denys-Drash syndrome
(abnormal genitourinary system).
Frasier syndrome (abnormal genitourinary system).
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
(abnormally large growth of one or more body parts, large tongue, umbilical
hernia
at birth, and abnormal genitourinary system).
A
family history
of Wilms tumor.
Aniridia (part or all of the
iris
, the colored part of the eye, is missing).
Isolated
hemihyperplasia
(abnormally large growth of one or more body parts).
Urinary tract
problems such as
cryptorchidism
or
hypospadias
.
The child's mother being exposed to
pesticides
while she was
pregnant
.
Tests are used to screen for Wilms tumor.
Screening
tests are done in children with an increased risk of Wilms tumor. These tests may help find cancer early and decrease the chance of dying from cancer.
In general, children with an increased risk of Wilms tumor  should be screened for Wilms tumor every 3 months until they are at least 8 years old. An ultrasound test of the abdomen is usually used for screening. Small Wilms tumors may be found and removed before symptoms occur.
Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or hemihyperplasia are also screened for liver and
adrenal
tumors that are linked to these genetic syndromes. A test to check the
alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP) level in the blood and an ultrasound of the abdomen are done until the child is 4 years old. An ultrasound of the kidneys is done between the ages of 4 and 7 years old. A
physical exam
by a
specialist
(
geneticist
or
pediatric oncologist
) is done two times each year. In children with certain gene changes, a different schedule for ultrasound of the abdomen may be used.
Children with aniridia and a certain gene change are screened for Wilms tumor every 3 months until they are 8 years old. An ultrasound test of the abdomen is used for screening.
Some children develop Wilms tumor in both kidneys. These often appear   when Wilms tumor is first diagnosed, but Wilms tumor may also occur in the second kidney after the child is successfully  treated for Wilms tumor in one kidney. Children with an increased risk of a second Wilms tumor in the other kidney should be screened for Wilms tumor every 3 months for up to 8 years. An ultrasound test of the abdomen may be used for screening.
Having certain conditions may increase the risk of renal cell cancer.
Renal cell cancer may be related to the following conditions:
Von Hippel-Lindau disease
(an
inherited
condition that causes abnormal growth of
blood vessels
).  Children with Von Hippel-Lindau disease should be   checked yearly for renal cell cancer with an  ultrasound of the abdomen or an MRI      (magnetic resonance imaging)   beginning at age 8 to 11 years.
Tuberous sclerosis
(an inherited disease marked by noncancerous fatty cysts in the kidney).
Familial
renal cell cancer (an inherited condition that occurs when certain changes in the genes that cause kidney cancer are passed down from the parent to the child).
Renal medullary cancer (a  rare kidney cancer that grows and spreads quickly).
Hereditary leiomyomatosis
(an inherited
disorder
that increases the risk of having cancer of the kidney, skin, and
uterus
).
Prior
chemotherapy
or
radiation therapy
for a
childhood cancer
, such as
neuroblastoma
, soft tissue sarcoma,
leukemia
, or Wilms tumor may also increase the risk of renal cell cancer.  See the
Second Cancers
section in the PDQ summary about
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
for more information.
Treatment for Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may include genetic counseling.
Genetic counseling
(a discussion with a trained professional about genetic diseases and whether
genetic testing
is needed) may be done if the child has one of the following syndromes or conditions:
A
genetic syndrome or condition that increases the risk of Wilms tumor
.
An
inherited condition that increases the risk of renal cell cancer
.
Rhabdoid tumor
of the kidney.
Multilocular cystic nephroma.
Anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney.
Signs of Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors  include a lump in the abdomen and blood in the urine.
Sometimes childhood kidney tumors do not cause signs and symptoms and the parent finds a
mass
in the abdomen by chance or the mass is found during a well-child health check-up. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by kidney tumors or by other conditions.  Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:
A lump, swelling, or pain in the abdomen.
Blood in the urine.
High blood pressure
(headache, feeling very tired, chest pain, or  trouble seeing or breathing).
Hypercalcemia
(loss of
appetite
,
nausea
and
vomiting
, weakness, or feeling very tired).
Fever
for no known reason.
Loss of appetite.
Weight loss for no known reason.
Wilms tumor that has spread to the lungs or liver may cause the following signs and symptoms:
Cough.
Blood in the
sputum
.
Trouble breathing.
Pain in the abdomen.
Tests that examine the kidney and the blood are used to diagnose Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.
The following tests and procedures may be used:
Physical exam
and
health history
: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
Complete blood
			 count
(CBC)
: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and
			 checked for the following:
The number of
red blood cells
,
white blood cells
, and
platelets
.
The amount of
hemoglobin
(the
protein
that carries
oxygen
) in
				  the red blood cells.
The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood
				  cells.
Blood chemistry studies
: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. This test is done to check how well the liver and kidneys are working.
Renal function test
: A procedure in which blood or urine samples are checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood or urine by the kidneys. A higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign that the kidneys are not working as they should.
Urinalysis
: A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, blood, and
bacteria
.
Ultrasound exam
: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a
sonogram
. An ultrasound of the abdomen is done to diagnose a kidney tumor.
Enlarge
Abdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound transducer connected to a computer is pressed against the skin of the abdomen. The transducer bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).
CT scan
(CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, and
pelvis
, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine. A
dye
is
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.

Computed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the  abdomen. A substance called
gadolinium
is injected into  a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
Enlarge
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.
X-ray
: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body, such as the chest and abdomen.
PET-CT scan
: A procedure that combines the pictures from a
positron emission tomography (PET) scan
and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself. A PET scan is a procedure to find
malignant
tumor cells in the body. A small amount of
radioactive
glucose
(sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET
scanner
rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Biopsy
: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a
microscope
by a
pathologist
to check for signs of cancer. The decision of whether to do a biopsy is based on the following:
The size of the tumor.
The
stage
of the cancer. If  the  tumor appears to be
resectable
or
stage I
or
stage II Wilms tumor
, a biopsy is not done to avoid tumor cells being  spread during the procedure.
Whether cancer is in one or both kidneys.
Whether imaging tests clearly show the cancer.
Whether the patient is in a
clinical trial
.
A biopsy may be done before any treatment is given, after chemotherapy to shrink the tumor, or after surgery to remove the tumor.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
The
prognosis
and treatment options for Wilms tumor depend on the following:
How different the tumor cells are from normal kidney cells when looked at under a microscope.
The stage of the cancer.
The type of tumor.
The age of the child.
Whether the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.
Whether there are certain changes in
chromosomes
or genes.
Whether the cancer  has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).
The prognosis for renal cell cancer depends on the following:
The stage of the cancer.
Whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.
The prognosis for rhabdoid tumor of the kidney depends on the following:
The age of the child at the time of diagnosis.
The stage of the cancer.
Whether the cancer has spread to the brain or
spinal cord
.
The prognosis for clear cell sarcoma of the kidney depends on the following:
The age of the child at the time of diagnosis.
The stage of the cancer.
Stages of Wilms Tumor
Key Points
Wilms tumors are  staged during surgery and with imaging tests.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
In addition to the stages, Wilms tumors are described by their histology.
The following stages are used for both favorable      histology and anaplastic Wilms tumors:
Stage I
Stage II
Stage III
Stage IV
Stage V (bilateral)
Sometimes Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors come back after treatment.
Wilms tumors are  staged during surgery and with imaging tests.
The process used to find out if
cancer
has spread outside of the
kidney
to other parts of the body is called
staging
. The information gathered from the staging process determines the
stage
of the disease. The results of the tests and procedures done to
diagnose
and stage
Wilms tumor
are used to help make decisions about treatment.
There is no staging for the other types of childhood kidney
tumors
. The treatment of these tumors depends on the tumor type.
The following tests may be done to see if cancer has spread to other places in the body:
Lymph node biopsy
: The removal of all or part of a
lymph node
in the
abdomen
. A
pathologist
views the lymph node
tissue
under a
microscope
to check for cancer
cells
. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy or lymph node dissection.
Liver function test
: A procedure in which a
blood
sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the
liver
. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign  that the liver is not working as it should.
X-ray
of the chest and bones
: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body, such as the chest.
CT scan
(CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen,
pelvis
, chest, and brain, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine. A
dye
is
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the
organs
or
tissues
show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
PET-CT scan
: A procedure that combines the pictures from a
positron emission tomography (PET) scan
and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both
scans
are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself. A PET scan is a procedure to find
malignant
tumor
cells in the body. A small amount of
radioactive
glucose
(sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET
scanner
rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the
abdomen
,
pelvis
, and brain. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
Bone scan
: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing
cells
, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of
radioactive
material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a
scanner
.

Bone scan.  A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the child's vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive material collects in the bones. As the child lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen.
Ultrasound
exam
: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a
sonogram
. An ultrasound of the major heart
vessels
is done to stage
Wilms tumor
.
Cystoscopy
: A procedure to look inside the
bladder
and
urethra
to check for
abnormal
areas.  A
cystoscope
is inserted through the urethra into the bladder.  A cystoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a
lens
for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called
metastasis
. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the
primary tumor
) and travel through the lymph system or blood.
Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a
tumor
(
metastatic
tumor) in another part of the body.
Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  Wilms tumor spreads to the
lung
, the cancer cells in the lung are actually Wilms tumor cells. The disease is metastatic Wilms tumor, not lung cancer.
Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.
In addition to the stages, Wilms tumors are described by their histology.
The
histology
(how the cells look under a microscope) of the
tumor
affects the
prognosis
and     the treatment of Wilms tumor. The histology may be favorable or
anaplastic
(unfavorable). Tumors with a favorable histology have a better prognosis and
respond
better to
chemotherapy
than anaplastic tumors. Tumor cells that are anaplastic divide quickly and under a microscope do not look like the type of cells they came from. Anaplastic tumors are harder to treat with chemotherapy than other Wilms tumors at the same stage.
The following stages are used for both favorable      histology and anaplastic Wilms tumors:
Stage I
In
stage I
, the
tumor
was completely removed by
surgery
and all of the following are true:
Cancer
was found only in the
kidney
and did not spread to
blood vessels
in the renal
sinus
(the part of the kidney where it joins the
ureter
) or to the
lymph nodes
.
No cancer
cells
were found at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed.
The outer layer of the kidney did not break open.
The tumor did not break open.
A
biopsy
was not done before the tumor was removed.
Stage II
In
stage II
, the
tumor
was completely removed by
surgery
and no
cancer
cells
were found at the edges of the area where the cancer was removed. Cancer has not spread to
lymph nodes
. Before the tumor was removed, one of the following was  true:
Cancer had spread  to the renal
sinus
(the part of the
kidney
where it joins the
ureter
).
Cancer had spread to
blood vessels
outside the area of the kidney where
urine
is made, such as the renal sinus.
Stage III
In
stage III
,
cancer
remains in the
abdomen
after
surgery
and at least one of the  following is true:
Cancer has spread to
lymph nodes
in the abdomen or
pelvis
(the part of the body between the hips).
Cancer has spread to or through the surface of the
peritoneum
(the
tissue
that lines the
abdominal
cavity
and covers most
organs
in the abdomen).
A biopsy of the
tumor
was done before it was removed.
The tumor broke open before or during surgery to remove it.
The tumor was removed in more than one piece.
Cancer
cells
are found at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed.
The entire tumor could not be removed because important organs or tissues in the body would be damaged.
Stage IV
In
stage IV
,
cancer
has spread through the
blood
to
organs
such as the
lungs
,
liver
, bone, or brain, or to
lymph nodes
outside the
abdomen
and
pelvis
.
Stage V (bilateral)
In
stage V
(
bilateral
) Wilms tumor,
cancer
cells
are found in both
kidneys
when the cancer is first
diagnosed
. The cancer in each kidney is staged separately as stage I, II, III, or IV.
Sometimes Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors come back after treatment.
Childhood Wilms tumor may
recur
(come back) in the lungs, abdomen, liver, or other places in the body.
Childhood
clear cell sarcoma of the kidney
may recur in the brain, lungs, or other places in the body.
Childhood
congenital mesoblastic nephroma
may recur in the kidneys or in other places in the body.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for patients with Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.
Children with Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors  should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
Six types of treatment are used:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Immunotherapy
High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue
Targeted therapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Treatment for Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for patients with Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.
Different types of treatment are available for children with
Wilms
and other childhood
kidney
tumors
. Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
. A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with
cancer
. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.     Some clinical trials  are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Children with Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors  should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
Your child's treatment will be overseen by a
pediatric oncologist
, a doctor who
specializes
in treating children with cancer.  The pediatric oncologist works with other
pediatric
health care providers
who are experts in treating  children with Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors  and who specialize in certain areas of
medicine
.  These may include the following specialists:
Pediatrician
.
Pediatric surgeon
or
urologist
.
Radiation oncologist
.
Rehabilitation specialist
.
Pediatric nurse  specialist
.
Social worker
.
Six types of treatment are used:
Surgery
Two types of
surgery
are used to treat kidney tumors:
Nephrectomy
: Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors are usually treated with nephrectomy (surgery to remove the whole kidney). Nearby
lymph nodes
may also be removed and checked for
signs
of cancer. Sometimes a kidney
transplant
(surgery to remove the kidney and replace it with a kidney from a
donor
) is done when the cancer is in both kidneys and the kidneys are not working well.
Partial nephrectomy
: If cancer is found in both kidneys or is likely to spread to both kidneys, surgery  may include a partial nephrectomy (removal of the cancer in the kidney and a small amount of normal
tissue
around it). Partial nephrectomy is done to  keep as much of the kidney working as possible. A partial nephrectomy is also called renal-sparing surgery.
After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or
radiation therapy
after surgery to kill any cancer
cells
that are left. Treatment given after the surgery,      to lower the risk that the cancer  will come back, is called
adjuvant therapy
. Sometimes, a
second-look surgery
is done to see if cancer remains after chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
Sometimes the tumor cannot be removed by surgery for one of the following reasons:
The tumor is too close to important
organs
or
blood vessels
.
The tumor is too large to remove.
The cancer is in both kidneys, unless the tumors are very small.
There is a
blood clot
in the vessels near the
liver
.
The patient has trouble breathing because cancer has spread to the
lungs
.
In this case, a
biopsy
is done first. Then chemotherapy is given to reduce the size of the tumor before surgery, in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible and lessen problems after surgery. This is called
neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is given after surgery.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
External radiation therapy is used to treat Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
Combination chemotherapy
is treatment using two or more anticancer drugs.
Systemic chemotherapy is used to treat Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.
Sometimes chemotherapy is given to reduce the size of the tumor before surgery, in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible and lessen problems after surgery. This is called
neoadjuvant
chemotherapy.
See
Drugs Approved for Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Cancers
for more information.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy
is a treatment that uses the patient's
immune system
to fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.  This cancer treatment is a type of
biologic therapy
.
Interferon
and
interleukin-2
(IL-2) are types of immunotherapy used to treat childhood
renal cell cancer
. Interferon may slow tumor growth and may help kill the cancer cells. IL-2 boosts the growth and activity of many immune cells, especially
lymphocytes
(a type of
white blood cell
). Lymphocytes can attack and kill cancer cells.
High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue
High doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including
blood
-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.
Stem cell rescue
is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.
Stem cells
(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or
bone marrow
of the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an
infusion
. These stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.
High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue may be used to treat
rhabdoid tumor
of the kidney or
recurrent
Wilms tumor.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.  Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Targeted therapy used to treat childhood kidney tumors may include the following:
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
: This targeted therapy blocks signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide.
Larotrectinib
and
entrectinib
may be used to treat
congenital mesoblastic nephroma
with a certain
gene
change that cannot be removed by surgery, has spread to other parts of the body, or has continued to grow during treatment. This combination is also being studied to treat congenital mesoblastic nephroma that has come back after treatment.
Sunitinib
or
cabozantinib
may be used to treat renal cell carcinoma.
Axitinib
is being studied in combination with a monoclonal antibody (
nivolumab
) to treat renal cell carcinoma that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body.
Histone methyltransferase inhibitors
: This targeted therapy may keep the cancer cells from growing and dividing.
Tazemetostat
is being studied to treat
rhabdoid tumor of the kidney
that does not respond or has come back after treatment.
Monoclonal antibody
therapy
: Monoclonal antibodies are
immune system
proteins
made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these
antibodies
can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by
infusion
. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,
toxins
, or
radioactive
material directly to cancer cells.
Nivolumab
or a combination of nivolumab and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (axitinib) are being studied to treat renal cell carcinoma that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body.
How do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.
Other targeted therapies are being studied for the treatment of childhood kidney tumors that have
recurred
(come back).
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Treatment for Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may cause side effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called
late effects
. Late effects of cancer  treatment may include the following:
Physical problems, such as problems with the heart, the kidney, or during
pregnancy
.
Infertility
.
Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.
Second cancers
(new types of cancer), such as
leukemias
, cancer of the
gastrointestinal tract
, or
breast cancer
.
Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the
PDQ
summary about
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
for more information).
Clinical trials are being done to find out if lower
doses
of
chemotherapy
and
radiation
can be used to lessen the late effects of treatment without changing how well the treatment works.
Monitoring
for
late effects
involving the kidneys in  patients with Wilms tumor and related  conditions includes the following:
Children with
WAGR syndrome
are monitored throughout their lives because they are at increased risk of
developing
hypertension
and kidney disease.
Children with Wilms tumor and
abnormal
genitourinary system
are monitored  because they are  at increased risk of late kidney failure.
Patients with
Wilms tumor and
aniridia
without abnormal genitourinary system are at lower
risk but are monitored for  kidney disease or
kidney failure
.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

#Question#: What are the stages of Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors ?
#Answer#: The stages of Wilms Tumor and other childhood kidney tumors are as follows:
1. Stage I: The tumor is completely removed by surgery, and it has not spread to blood vessels in the renal sinus or lymph nodes. The outer layer of the kidney did not break open, and the tumor did not break open. No cancer cells were found at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed, and a biopsy was not done before the tumor was removed.
2. Stage II: The tumor is completely removed by surgery, and no cancer cells were found at the edges of the area where the cancer was removed. Cancer has not spread to lymph nodes, but it may have spread to the renal sinus or blood vessels outside the area of the kidney where urine is made before the tumor was removed.
3. Stage III: Cancer remains in the abdomen after surgery, and it may have spread to lymph nodes in the abdomen or pelvis, or to the surface of the peritoneum (the layer of tissue that lines the abdominal cavity). The tumor may have been removed in more than one piece, or cancer cells may be found at the edges of the area where the tumor was removed. The entire tumor could not be removed without damaging important organs or tissues in the body.
4. Stage IV: Cancer has spread through the blood to organs such as the lungs, liver, bone, or brain, or to lymph nodes outside of the abdomen and pelvis.
5. Stage V: Cancer cells are found in both kidneys when the cancer is first diagnosed.

1. The answer misunderstands the question context and intention.
2. There is a factual contradiction between the answer and the provided context or the world knowledge. Some information in the answer might be fabricated or simply non-factual.
3. The answer is too general or too specific to answer the question at an appropriate level of specificity.
4. The answer cannot be correctly inferred from the knowledge.

You should try your best to determine if the answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information according to any of the above hallucination types. Do NOT judge whether the error was intentional or not. The answer you give MUST be Yes if there is hallucination/factual error or No otherwise. Do not write any additional explanation.

Use this format when writing your response:
#Verdict#: <Yes if you have found any hallucination, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Verdict#: No, the answer does not contain any non-factual or hallucinated information based on the provided context and world knowledge. The answer is consistent with the medical terminology and concepts mentioned in the question and provides relevant information about the stages of Wilms Tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.
---
VERDICT 0.0
>> #Verdict#: Yes, the answer contains non-factual information. The answer states that "Treatment of recurrent Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may include a clinical trial of targeted therapy (LOXO-101 or entrectinib)." However, there is no evidence to support the use of LOXO-101 or entrectinib as a treatment for recurrent Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors. These drugs are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of these types of tumors, and there are limited clinical trials available for these treatments. Therefore, the answer contains non-factual information.
---
VERDICT 1.0
>> #Verdict#: Yes. The answer contains factual errors and hallucinations. Specifically, the answer states that Stage I of Wilms Tumor and other childhood kidney tumors is "completely removed by surgery, and it has not spread to blood vessels in the renal sinus or lymph nodes." This is incorrect as Stage I is defined as a tumor that is completely removable by surgery without spreading to lymph nodes or blood vessels. Additionally, the answer states that cancer remains in the abdomen after surgery, which is not accurate as the goal of surgery is to remove the entire tumor.
---
VERDICT 1.0
>> #Verdict#: Yes, the answer contains non-factual information. The answer states that treatment of recurrent Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may include "A clinical trial that checks a sample of the patient's tumor for certain gene changes. The type of targeted therapy that will be given to the patient depends on the type of gene change." However, there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that checking a patient's tumor for specific gene changes can determine the appropriate targeted therapy for recurrent Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors. Targeted therapies are typically selected based on the biology of the tumor and the individual patient's genetic profile, not on the presence of specific gene changes in the tumor.
---
VERDICT 1.0
>> #Verdict#: Yes, the answer contains non-factual information. The answer states that "Treatment of recurrent Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may include a clinical trial of targeted therapy (LOXO-101 or entrectinib)." However, there is no evidence to support the use of these specific targeted therapies for the treatment of recurrent Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors. According to the National Cancer Institute's website, there are several clinical trials ongoing for the treatment of these types of tumors, but they do not include LOXO-101 or entrectinib as options. Therefore, the answer contains non-factual information.

>> #Context#: Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Screening (PDQ®)–Patient Version
What is screening?
Screening
is  looking for
cancer
before a person has any
symptoms
. This can help find
		cancer at an early
stage
. When
abnormal
tissue
or cancer is found early, it may
		be easier to treat. By the time symptoms  appear, cancer may have begun
		to  spread.
Scientists
are trying to better understand which
		people are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things
		we do and the things around us to see if they cause  cancer. This
		information helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which
		screening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done.
It is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily
		think you have cancer if he or she suggests a  screening test. Screening
		tests are given when you  have no cancer symptoms.
If a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called
diagnostic tests
.
General Information About Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers
Key Points
Ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells
		  form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.
In the United States, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women.
Different factors increase or decrease the risk of getting ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers.
Ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells
		  form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.
The
ovaries
are a pair
		  of
organs
in the female
reproductive
		  system
. They are located in the
pelvis
, one on each side of the
uterus
(the hollow, pear-shaped
		  organ where a
fetus
grows). Each
		  ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries produce eggs and
		  female
hormones
(
chemicals
that
		  control the way certain
cells
or
		  organs function).
The
fallopian tubes
are a pair of long, slender tubes, one on each side of the uterus. Eggs pass from the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus.
Cancer
sometimes begins at the end of the fallopian tube near the ovary and spreads to the ovary.
The
peritoneum
is the
tissue
that lines the
abdominal
wall and covers organs in the
abdomen
.
Primary peritoneal cancer
is cancer that forms in the peritoneum and has not spread there from another part of the body. Cancer sometimes begins in the peritoneum and spreads to the ovary.
Ovarian epithelial cancer
,
fallopian tube cancer
, and primary peritoneal cancer form in the same type of tissue. Studies of
screening
tests look at these cancers together.
Enlarge
Anatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium.

ovarian
, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers, see the following:

In the United States, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women.
While ovarian cancer is rare, it is the leading cause of  death from
cancer
of the female reproductive system. The number of new cases of ovarian cancer decreased slightly each year from 1990 to the mid-2010s, but increased slightly each year from 2014 to 2018. There was a slight decrease in the number of deaths from ovarian cancer each year from 2015 to 2019.
Different factors increase or decrease the risk of getting ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers.
Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease
		  is called a
risk factor
. Anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a
protective factor
.
For information about risk factors and protective factors for ovarian cancer, see
Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Prevention

Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Screening
Key Points
Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does  not have symptoms.
Screening tests have not been shown to decrease the chance of dying from ovarian cancer.
Screening tests that have been studied include:
Pelvic exam
Transvaginal ultrasound
CA-125 assay
Screening tests for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are being studied in clinical trials.
Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does  not have symptoms.
Scientists
study
screening
tests to find those with the fewest harms and most benefits.
Cancer
screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes
symptoms
)  helps a person live longer or decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, the chance of
recovery
is better if the disease is found and treated at an early
stage
.
Screening tests have not been shown to decrease the chance of dying from ovarian cancer.
Screening tests that have been studied include:
Pelvic exam
Pelvic exams
to screen for ovarian cancer have not been shown to decrease the number of deaths from the disease. A pelvic exam is an exam of the
vagina
,
cervix
,
uterus
,
fallopian tubes
,
ovaries
, and
rectum
.    A
speculum
is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or
nurse
looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two
lubricated
, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower
abdomen
to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or
abnormal
areas.
Enlarge
Pelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.
Transvaginal ultrasound
Transvaginal ultrasound
(TVU) to screen for ovarian cancer has not been shown to decrease the number of deaths from the disease. TVU is a procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and
bladder
. An
ultrasound transducer
(probe)  is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (
ultrasound
) off internal
tissues
or
organs
and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a
sonogram
.
Enlarge
Transvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).
CA-125 assay
A
CA-125
assay
is a test that measures the level of CA-125 in the
blood
.  CA-125 is a type of
biomarker
(a substance released by
cells
into the bloodstream that may be a sign of a
condition
or disease). An increased CA-125 level is sometimes a sign of certain types of cancer, including ovarian cancer, or other conditions.
Studies have also shown that using CA-125 levels and TVU together to screen for ovarian cancer does not decrease the number of deaths from ovarian cancer.
Screening tests for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are being studied in clinical trials.

Risks of Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Screening
Key Points
Screening tests have risks.
The risks of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers        screening tests include the following:
Finding ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers may not improve health or help a woman live
			 longer.
False-negative test results can occur.
False-positive test results can occur.
Screening tests have risks.
Decisions about
screening
tests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may
		  want to talk about  the test with your doctor.  It is important to know the risks of
		  the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from
cancer
.
The risks of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers        screening tests include the following:
Finding ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers may not improve health or help a woman live
			 longer.
Screening
			 may not improve your health or help  you live longer if  you have
advanced
ovarian cancer
or if it has already spread to
			 other places in  your body.
False-negative test results can occur.
Screening test results may appear to be normal even though ovarian cancer is
			 present. A woman who receives a
false-negative test result
(one that
			 shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care  even if she has symptoms.
False-positive test results can occur.
Screening test results may appear to be
abnormal
even though no
			 cancer is present. A
false-positive test result
(one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause
anxiety
and is usually followed by more  tests  (such as
			  a
laparoscopy
or a
laparotomy
to see if cancer is present), which also have risks. Problems caused by tests used to
diagnose
ovarian cancer include
infection
,
blood
loss,
bowel
injury, and heart and
blood vessel
problems. A false-positive test result can also lead to an unneeded
oophorectomy
(removal of one or both
ovaries
).

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers screening.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board
.
Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website

General Information About Childhood Medulloblastoma and Other  Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors
Key Points
Medulloblastoma and other central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors  may begin in embryonic (fetal) cells that remain in the brain after birth.
There are different types of CNS embryonal tumors.
Pineoblastoma forms in cells of the pineal gland.
Certain genetic conditions increase the risk of childhood medulloblastoma.
Genetic counseling may be done for children with medulloblastoma or pineoblastoma.
Symptoms of medulloblastoma, other  CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma depend on the child's age and where the tumor is.
Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to diagnose childhood medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma.
A biopsy may be done to be sure of the diagnosis.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
You may want to get a second opinion.
Medulloblastoma and other central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors  may begin in embryonic (fetal) cells that remain in the brain after birth.
Medulloblastoma
is a fast-growing tumor that forms in the
cerebellum
(the lower, back part of the brain). Medulloblastoma is the most common type of
CNS
embryonal tumor
. CNS embryonal tumors are uncontrolled growths of cells in the brain. These tumors form in cells that are left over from
fetal
development, called embryonal cells.
Pineoblastoma
is a fast-growing type of brain tumor that forms in or around a tiny organ near the center of the brain called the
pineal gland
.
These tumors may be
benign
(not cancer) or
malignant
(cancer). Benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain but rarely spread to other parts of the brain.  Malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other parts of the brain. They may also spread to other parts of the body, but this is rare. When a tumor grows into and presses on an area of the brain or spreads to other parts of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause serious
signs
or
symptoms
and need treatment.
Most medulloblastomas, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastomas in children are malignant. These tumors tend to spread through the
cerebrospinal fluid
to other parts of  the brain and
spinal cord
.
Although cancer is rare in children, brain tumors are the second most common type of
childhood cancer
, after
leukemia
. 

This summary is about  the treatment of
primary
brain tumors (tumors that begin in the brain).

Anatomy of the inside of the brain, showing the pineal and pituitary glands, optic nerve, ventricles (with cerebrospinal fluid shown in blue), and other parts of the brain.
There are different types of CNS embryonal tumors.
The different types of CNS embryonal tumors include:
Medulloblastomas
Most CNS embryonal tumors are medulloblastomas. Medulloblastomas   are fast-growing tumors that  form in brain cells in the cerebellum.  The cerebellum is at the lower  back part of the brain  between the
cerebrum
and the
brain stem
. The cerebellum controls movement, balance, and posture. It is rare for medulloblastomas to spread to the bone,
bone marrow
,
lung
, or other parts of the body.
Other types of CNS embryonal tumors (nonmedulloblastoma)
Other types of CNS embryonal tumors are fast-growing tumors and may form in brain cells anywhere in the brain, including the cerebrum, brain stem, or spinal cord. The cerebrum is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain. The cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem-solving, emotions, speech, reading, writing, and voluntary movement. It is rare for these tumors to spread to the bone, bone marrow, lung, or other parts of the body.
There are many types of CNS embryonal (nonmedulloblastoma) tumors:
Cribriform neuroepithelial tumors
Cribriform
neuroepithelial
tumor forms in the
ventricles
in the brain. This tumor most often occurs in infants and young children. Cribriform neuroepithelial tumor occurs more often in boys.
Embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes
Embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) are rare tumors that form in the brain and spinal cord. ETMR most commonly occur in young children and are fast-growing tumors.
CNS neuroblastomas
CNS
neuroblastomas
are a very rare type of neuroblastoma that form in the nerve tissue of the cerebrum or the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord. CNS neuroblastomas may be large and    spread to other parts of the brain or spinal cord.
CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with a change in the
BCOR
gene
CNS
high-grade
neuroepithelial tumor is a very rare tumor that forms in the brain. This tumor occurs most often in children younger than 10 years, but can occur in older children and adolescents.
CNS Ewing sarcoma with a change in the
CIC
gene
CNS
Ewing sarcoma
is a very rare tumor found in the brain or
spine
. This tumor most often occurs in children younger than 10 years.
CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with a change in the
MN1
gene
CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor is a very rare tumor that forms in the brain or spinal cord. This tumor most often occurs in adolescents and females.
Medulloepitheliomas
Medulloepithelioma  is a fast-growing tumor that usually forms  in the brain, spinal cord, or nerves just outside the
spinal column
. It occurs most often in infants and young children.
CNS
atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor
is also a type of embryonal tumor, but it is treated differently than other childhood CNS embryonal tumors. For more information, see
Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor Treatment
.
Pineoblastoma forms in cells of the pineal gland.
The pineal gland is a tiny organ in the center of the brain. The gland makes
melatonin
, a substance that helps control our sleep cycle.
Pineoblastoma
are usually malignant   fast-growing tumors with cells that  look very different from normal pineal gland cells. Pineoblastomas are not a type of CNS embryonal tumor but treatment for them is similar to treatment for CNS embryonal tumors.
Pineoblastoma is linked with
inherited
changes in the
retinoblastoma
(
RB1
) gene. A child with the inherited form of  retinoblastoma (cancer that forms in the tissues of the
retina
) has an increased risk of pineoblastoma. When retinoblastoma forms at the same time as a tumor in or near the pineal gland, it is called trilateral retinoblastoma.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging) testing in  children with retinoblastoma may detect pineoblastoma at an early stage when it can be treated successfully. It is rare for pineoblastoma to spread to the bone, bone marrow, lung, or other parts of the body.
Certain genetic conditions increase the risk of childhood medulloblastoma.
Childhood medulloblastoma is caused by certain changes to the way brain cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. Often, the exact cause of the cell changes is unknown. To learn more about how cancer develops, see
What is Cancer?
.
A
risk factor
is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Not every child with one or more of these risk factors will develop medulloblastoma, and it will develop in some children who don't have a known risk factor. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.
The risk for medulloblastoma is increased in people who have any of the following inherited diseases:
Turcot syndrome
Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome
Nevoid basal cell carcinoma (Gorlin) syndrome
Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Fanconi anemia
Genetic counseling may be done for children with medulloblastoma or pineoblastoma.
It may not be clear from the
family medical history
whether a child with a brain tumor has an inherited condition that increased their risk.
Genetic counselors
and other specially trained health professionals can discuss your child's
diagnosis
and the family's medical history to understand:
your options for
ELP1
,
APC
,
SUFU
,
PTCH1
,
TP53
,
PALB2
, or
BRCA2
gene testing if your child has medulloblastoma
your options for
RB1
or
DICER1
gene testing if your child has pineoblastoma
the risk of other cancers for your child
the risk of cancer for your child's siblings
the risks and benefits of learning
genetic
information
Genetic counselors can also help you cope with your child's
genetic testing
results, including how to discuss the results with family members.
Symptoms of medulloblastoma, other  CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma depend on the child's age and where the tumor is.
Children may not have symptoms of medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, or pineoblastoma until the tumor has grown bigger. It's important to check with your child's doctor if your child has any symptoms below:
loss of balance, trouble walking, lack of coordination, or slow speech
headache, especially in the morning, or headache that goes away after
vomiting
general weakness
weakness on one side of the face
unusual sleepiness or change in energy level
seizures
double vision or other eye problems
nausea
and vomiting
Infants and young children with these tumors may be irritable or grow slowly. Also they may not eat well or meet
developmental milestones
such as sitting, walking, and talking in sentences. These tumors may also cause an increase in the size of an infant's head.
These symptoms may be caused by conditions other than medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, or pineoblastoma. The only way to know is to see your child's doctor. The doctor will ask you when the symptoms started and how often your child has been having them as a first step in making the diagnosis.
Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to diagnose childhood medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma.
If your child has symptoms that suggest medulloblastoma, another type of CNS embryonal tumor, or pineoblastoma, the doctor will need to find out if these are due to cancer or another condition. They will ask about your child's
personal
and family health history and do a
physical exam
. Depending on the results, the doctor may recommend tests to find out if your child has a brain tumor. The results of these tests will also help you and your child's doctor plan treatment.
The following tests and procedures are used to diagnose medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma:
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain and spinal cord with
gadolinium
is a procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is
injected
into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Sometimes magnetic resonance
spectroscopy
(MRS) is   
done during the MRI scan to look at the chemicals in brain tissue.
CT scan
(CAT scan)
uses a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine to make a series of detailed pictures inside the body from different angles. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. To learn more, see
Computed Tomography (CT) Scans and Cancer
.
Lumbar puncture
is a procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is     checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells. The sample may also be checked for the amounts of
protein
and
glucose
. A higher-than-normal amount of protein or lower-than-normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.
Enlarge
Lumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.
A biopsy may be done to be sure of the diagnosis.
If doctors think your child may have medulloblastoma, another type of CNS embryonal tumor, or pineoblastoma, a
biopsy
may be done. The biopsy is done by removing part of the
skull
and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue. Sometimes, a computer-guided needle is used to remove the tissue sample. A
pathologist
views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery. The piece of skull is usually put back in place after the procedure.
Enlarge
Craniotomy.  An opening is made in the skull and a piece of the skull is removed to show part of the brain.
The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:
Immunohistochemistry
is a
laboratory test
that uses
antibodies
to check for certain
antigens
(
markers
) in a sample of a patient's tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an
enzyme
or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
If your child has been diagnosed with medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumor, or pineoblastoma, you may have questions about how serious the cancer is and your child's chances of survival. The likely outcome or course of a disease is called prognosis.
The prognosis and treatment options depend on:
the type of tumor and where it is in the brain
whether the cancer has spread within the brain and spinal cord when the tumor is found
the age of the child when the tumor is found
how much of the tumor remains after surgery
whether there are certain changes in the
chromosomes
, genes, or brain cells
whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or  has
recurred
(come back)
Your child's cancer care team is in the best position to talk with you about your child's prognosis.
You may want to get a second opinion.
You may want to get a
second opinion
to confirm your child's diagnosis and treatment plan. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get important medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the
pathology report
, slides, and scans before giving a recommendation. The doctor who gives the second opinion may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another approach, or provide more information about your child's tumor.
To learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see
Finding Cancer Care
. You can contact
NCI's Cancer Information Service
via chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor or hospital that can provide a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, see

.
Staging Childhood Medulloblastoma, Other Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors, and Pineoblastoma
Key Points
Medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma in children are treated based on the tumor type and the child's age.
Treatment of medulloblastoma in children older than 3 years  also depends on whether the tumor is average risk or high risk.
Average risk
High risk
The results of the tests and procedures done to diagnose medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma in children are used to plan cancer treatment.
Sometimes childhood medulloblastoma and other central nervous system embryonal tumors come back after treatment.
Medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma in children are treated based on the tumor type and the child's age.
Cancer stage  describes the extent of cancer in the body, such as the size of the
tumor
, whether it has spread, and how far it has spread from where it first formed. There is no
staging system
used for childhood
medulloblastoma
, other
central nervous system
(CNS)
embryonal tumors,
or
pineoblastoma,
but the tests and procedures done to
diagnose
the cancer are also used to help plan treatment.
Treatment of other CNS embryonal tumors and pineoblastoma in children is based on the child's age. Children aged 3 years and younger  may be given different treatment than children older than 3 years.
Treatment of medulloblastoma in children older than 3 years  also depends on whether the tumor is average risk or high risk.
Average risk
Medulloblastomas are called average risk when all of the following are true:
The tumor was completely removed by
surgery
or there was only a very small amount remaining.
The cancer has not spread to other parts of the
				body.
High risk
Medulloblastomas are called high risk if any of the following are true:
Some of the tumor was not  removed by
				surgery.
The cancer has spread to other parts of the
brain
or
spinal cord
or to other parts of the body.
In general, cancer is more likely to
recur
(come back) after treatment in patients  with a high-risk tumor.
The results of the tests and procedures done to diagnose medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma in children are used to plan cancer treatment.
If your child is diagnosed with medulloblastoma, another type of CNS embryonal tumor, or pineoblastoma, they will be referred to a
pediatric oncologist
/
neuro-oncologist
. This is a doctor who specializes in staging and treating childhood cancers. They will recommend tests to determine the extent (stage) of cancer. Some of the tests used to diagnose the cancer are repeated after surgery. This is to find out how much tumor remains after surgery and to see if the cancer has spread from the brain to the
spine
or other parts of the body. It is important to know if the cancer has spread in order to plan the best treatment. For the list of diagnostic tests, see the
General Information
section.
The following tests may be used to find out if the cancer has spread beyond the brain and spinal cord:
Bone marrow aspiration
and
biopsy
are procedures in which a sample of
bone marrow
and bone is removed from the hipbone or
breastbone
using a special needle. A
pathologist
views the sample under a microscope to look for
signs
of cancer.
A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are only done when there are signs the cancer has spread to the bone marrow.
Enlarge
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.
Bone scan
is a procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing
cells
, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of
radioactive
material is
injected
into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a
scanner
. A bone scan is only done when there are signs or
symptoms
that       the cancer has spread to the bone.
Sometimes childhood medulloblastoma and other central nervous system embryonal tumors come back after treatment.
Childhood medulloblastoma and other types of CNS embryonal tumors most often recur (come back) within 3 years after treatment but may come back many years later. Recurrent childhood medulloblastoma and other CNS embryonal tumors may come back  in the same place as the original tumor and/or in a different place in the brain or spinal cord.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for children who have medulloblastoma and other central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors.
Children who have medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children.
The following types of treatment may be used:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue
Targeted therapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
There are different types of treatment for children who have medulloblastoma and other central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors.
There are different types of treatment for children and
adolescents
with
medulloblastoma
, other types of
CNS
embryonal tumors
, or
pineoblastoma
. You and your child's cancer care team will work together to decide treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as your child's overall health and whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has come back.
Children who have medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating brain tumors in children.
A pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer, will oversee treatment of medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with
brain tumors
and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists and others:
pediatrician
neurosurgeon
neurologist
neuropathologist
neuroradiologist
rehabilitation specialist
radiation oncologist
psychologist
Your child's treatment plan will include information about the cancer, the goals of treatment, treatment options, and the possible
side effects
. It will be helpful to talk with your child's cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect. For help every step of the way, see our downloadable booklet,
Children with Cancer: A Guide for Parents
.
The following types of treatment may be used:
Surgery
Surgery is used to diagnose and treat childhood medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma as described in the
General Information
section of this summary.
After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given
chemotherapy
,
radiation therapy
, or both to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. Medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, or pineoblastoma in children may be treated with
external beam radiation therapy
. External beam radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
Certain ways of giving external radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:
Conformal radiation therapy
uses a computer to make a
3-dimensional
(3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high
dose
of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.
Stereotactic radiation therapy
uses a machine that aims  radiation directly at the tumor, causing less damage to nearby healthy tissue.  The total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days. A rigid head frame is attached to the
skull
to keep the head still during this radiation treatment.  This procedure is also called stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotaxic radiation therapy.
Because radiation therapy can affect growth and brain development in young children, especially children who are 3 years or younger, chemotherapy may be given to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy.
Radiation therapy to the brain can also affect
growth and development
in children older than 3 years. For this reason,
clinical trials
are studying new ways of giving radiation that may have fewer side effects than
standard
methods.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy (also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.   Chemotherapy may be given alone or with other types of treatment, such as radiation therapy.
To treat medulloblastoma, other CNS embryonal tumors, and pineoblastoma, chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a vein. When given this way, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body.  Chemotherapy drugs that can cross the
blood-brain barrier
and reach tumor cells in the brain are used. These include:
carboplatin
cisplatin
cyclophosphamide
etoposide
irinotecan
lomustine
methotrexate
temozolomide
thiotepa
topotecan
vincristine
Combinations of these drugs may be used. Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.

Chemotherapy to Treat Cancer
.
High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue
High doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. This cancer treatment destroys healthy cells, including blood-forming cells.
Stem cell transplant
is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.
Stem cells
(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or
bone marrow
of the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an
infusion
. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
uses drugs or other substances to block the action of specific
enzymes
,
proteins
, or other
molecules
involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells.
Vismodegib
may be used to treat
recurrent
medulloblastoma in children who have finished growing.
Targeted therapy is also being studied for the treatment of childhood medulloblastoma and other CNS embryonal tumors that have recurred (come back) after treatment.

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.
Use our
clinical trial search
to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.

Side Effects
Key Points
The tumor and the treatment  may cause symptoms that continue after treatment ends.
The tumor and the treatment  may cause symptoms that continue after treatment ends.
Signs
or
symptoms
caused by the tumor may begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.  It is important to talk with your child's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called
late effects
. Late effects of cancer treatment may include:
Physical problems that affect
bone and muscle growth and development
thyroid
, heart, or hearing function
Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory
Second cancers
(new types of cancer), such as thyroid or other
brain tumors
Children diagnosed with medulloblastoma may have certain problems after surgery or radiation therapy, such as changes in the ability to think, learn, and pay attention. Also,
cerebellar mutism syndrome
may occur after surgery.  Signs of this syndrome include the following:
delayed ability to speak
trouble swallowing and eating
loss of balance, trouble walking, and worsening handwriting
loss of muscle tone
mood swings and changes in personality
Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child and the types of symptoms to expect after cancer treatment has ended. To learn more, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Follow-Up Testing
Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the
stage
of the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. This is sometimes called re-staging. For a list of tests, see the
General Information
section.
Some of the
imaging tests
will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the brain tumor has recurred (come back). If the imaging tests show
abnormal
tissue in the brain, a biopsy may also be done to find out if the tissue is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing. These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.
Coping With Cancer
When a child has cancer, every member of the family needs support. Honest and calm conversations build trust as you talk with your child and their siblings. Taking care of yourself during this difficult time is also important. Reach out to your child's treatment team and to people in your family and community for support. To learn more, see
Support for Families When a Child Has Cancer

General Information About Anal Cancer
Key Points
Anal cancer is a type of cancer that forms in
		  the tissues of the anus.
Most anal cancers are related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
Signs of anal cancer include bleeding from the anus or rectum or a lump near the anus.
Tests that examine the rectum and anus are used to diagnose anal  cancer.
After anal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the anus or to other parts of the body.
Certain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
Anal cancer is a type of cancer that forms in
		  the tissues of the anus.
The anus is the end of the
large intestine
. It is where stool (solid waste) leaves the body. The anus is formed partly from the outer skin layers of the body and partly from the intestine. The anus is connected to the
rectum
by the anal canal, which is about 1 to 1½ inches long. This area is controlled by two ring-like sphincter muscles, which contract to hold stool in and relax to allow its passage out of the body.
Enlarge
Anatomy of the lower gastrointestinal (digestive) system showing  the colon, rectum, and anus. Other organs that make up the digestive system are also shown.
Anal cancer can start in the lining of the anal canal, called the mucosa, or in the perianal skin, the squamous cells outside of the anus that contain hair follicles and sweat glands.
Tumors
of the perianal skin that do not involve the anal
sphincter  are usually  treated the same as anal cancers, although local therapy (treatment directed to a limited area of skin) may be used for some.
Most anal cancers are related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
Risk factors
for anal cancer include:
being
infected
with a
high-risk human papillomavirus
(HPV), especially HPV type 16 or 18
having a condition or disease that causes a weakened
immune system
, such as
HIV
or an organ
transplant
having a
personal history
of
vulvar
,
vaginal
, or
cervical cancers
having many sexual partners
having receptive anal intercourse (anal sex)
smoking
cigarettes
Signs of anal cancer include bleeding from the anus or rectum or a lump near the anus.
These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by anal cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have:
bleeding from the anus or rectum
a lump near the anus
pain or pressure in the area around the anus
itching or
discharge
from the anus
a change in
bowel
habits
Tests that examine the rectum and anus are used to diagnose anal  cancer.
In addition to asking about your
personal
and
family health history
and doing a
physical exam
, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:
Digital rectal examination
(DRE)
is an exam of the anus and rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts a
lubricated
, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual.
Enlarge
Digital rectal exam (DRE). The doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum and feels the rectum, anus, and prostate (in males) to check for anything abnormal.
Anoscopy
is an exam of the anus and lower rectum using a short, lighted tube called an anoscope.
Proctoscopy
is a procedure to look inside the rectum and anus to check for
abnormal
areas, using a proctoscope. A proctoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing the inside of the rectum and anus. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.
Endo-anal or
endorectal ultrasound
is a procedure in which an
ultrasound transducer
(probe) is inserted into the anus or rectum and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.
Biopsy
is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a
pathologist
to check for signs of cancer. If an abnormal area is seen during the anoscopy, a biopsy may be done at that time.
After anal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the anus or to other parts of the body.
The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the anus or to other
parts of the body is called
staging
. The information gathered from this
staging process determines the
stage
of the disease. It is important to know
the stage in order to plan treatment. The following tests may be used in the staging process:
CT scan
(CAT scan)
uses a computer linked to an x-ray machine to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the
abdomen
,
pelvis
, or chest. The pictures are taken from different angles and are used to create 3-D views of tissues and organs.  A dye may be
injected
into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Chest x-ray
is an x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging)
is a procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
PET scan
(positron emission tomography scan)
uses a small amount of radioactive glucose that is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes pictures of where glucose is being used in the body. Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Pelvic exam
is an exam of the
vagina
,
cervix
,
uterus
,
fallopian tubes
,
ovaries
, and
rectum
.    A
speculum
is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A
Pap test
of the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower
abdomen
to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.

This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.
Some people decide to get a second opinion.
You may want to get a second opinion to confirm your anal cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get medical test results and reports from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the pathology report, slides, and scans. They may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another treatment approach, or provide more information about your cancer.

.
Certain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
The prognosis depends on:
the size of the tumor
whether the cancer has spread to the
lymph nodes
The treatment options depend on:
the
stage
of the cancer
where the tumor  is in the anus
whether the person has HIV
whether cancer remains  after initial treatment or has recurred (come back)
Stages of Anal Cancer
Key Points
The following stages are used for anal cancer:
Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)
Stage I (also called stage 1) anal cancer
Stage II (also called stage 2) anal cancer
Stage III (also called stage 3) anal cancer
Stage IV (also called stage 4) anal cancer
Anal cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.
The following stages are used for anal cancer:
Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)
In stage 0,
abnormal
cells are found in the mucosa (innermost layer) of the anus. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called high-grade  intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).
Enlarge
Tumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).
Stage I (also called stage 1) anal cancer
In stage I,  cancer has formed and the  tumor is  2
centimeters
or smaller.
Stage II (also called stage 2) anal cancer
Stage II anal cancer
is divided into stages IIA and IIB.
In stage IIA, the tumor is larger than 2
centimeters
but not larger than 5 centimeters.
In stage IIB, the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters.
Stage III (also called stage 3) anal cancer
Stage III anal cancer is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC.
In stage IIIA, the tumor is 5
centimeters
or smaller and has spread to
lymph nodes
near the anus or
groin
.
In stage IIIB, the tumor is any size and has spread to nearby organs, such as the
vagina
,
urethra
, or
bladder
. Cancer has not spread to lymph nodes.
In stage IIIC, the tumor is any size and may have spread to nearby organs. Cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the anus or groin.
Stage IV (also called stage 4) anal cancer
In stage IV, the tumor is any size. Cancer may have spread to
lymph nodes
or nearby organs and has spread to other parts of the body, such as the
liver
or
lungs
.
Stage IV anal cancer is also called metastatic anal cancer. Metastatic cancer happens when cancer cells travel through the
lymphatic system
or blood and form tumors in other parts of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if anal cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually anal cancer cells. The disease is called metastatic anal cancer, not liver cancer. Learn more in
Metastatic Cancer: When Cancer Spreads
.
Anal cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.
Recurrent anal cancer is cancer that has come back after it has been treated. If anal cancer comes back, it may come back in the anus or in other parts of the body, such as the liver or
		lungs. Tests will be done to help determine where the cancer has returned. The type of treatment for recurrent anal cancer will depend on where it has come back.

Questions to Ask Your Doctor About Treatment
.
The following types of treatment are used:
Surgery
Local resection is a  surgical procedure in which the tumor is cut from the anus along with some of the healthy tissue around it. Local resection may be used if the cancer is small and has not spread. This procedure may save the
sphincter
muscles so the person can still control
bowel
movements. Tumors that form in the lower part of the anus can often be removed with local resection.
Abdominoperineal resection
is a surgical procedure in which the anus, the
rectum
, and part of the
sigmoid colon
are removed through an
incision
made in the
abdomen
. The doctor sews the end of the
intestine
to an opening, called a
stoma
, made in the surface of the abdomen so body waste can be collected in a disposable bag outside of the body. This is called a
colostomy
.
Lymph nodes
that contain cancer may also be removed during this operation. This procedure   is used only  for cancer that remains or comes back after treatment with
radiation therapy
and chemotherapy.
Enlarge
Resection of the colon with colostomy. Part of the colon containing the cancer and nearby healthy tissue are removed, a stoma is created, and a colostomy bag is attached to the stoma.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy
uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy used to treat anal cancer:
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
Internal radiation therapy
uses a
radioactive
substance sealed in needles,
seeds
, wires, or
catheters
that are placed directly into or near the cancer.
Learn more about
Radiation Therapy to Treat Cancer
and
Radiation Therapy Side Effects
.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy (also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing.   When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
Chemotherapy drugs used to treat anal cancer include:
capecitabine
cisplatin
fluorouracil
mitomycin
Combinations of these drugs may be used. Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.
Chemotherapy may be combined with other types of treatment, such as radiation therapy.

This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials.  It may not mention every new treatment being studied.
Radiosensitizers
Radiosensitizers
are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy helps a person’s immune system fight cancer. Your doctor may suggest biomarker tests to help predict your response to certain immunotherapy drugs. Learn more about

As you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

General Information About Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma
Key Points
Childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in muscle tissue.
Certain genetic conditions increase the risk of  childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.
A sign of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is a lump or swelling that keeps getting bigger.
Diagnostic tests and a biopsy are used to diagnose childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
Childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in muscle tissue.
Rhabdomyosarcoma
is a type of
sarcoma
. Sarcoma is
cancer
of
soft tissue
(such as muscle),
connective tissue
(such as
tendon
or
cartilage
), or bone. Rhabdomyosarcoma usually begins in muscles that are attached to  bones and that help the body move, but it may begin in many places in the body. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children.
There are four main types of rhabdomyosarcoma:
Embryonal
: This type occurs most often  in the head and neck area or  in the
genital
or
urinary
organs
, but can occur anywhere in the body. It is the most common type of rhabdomyosarcoma.
Alveolar
: This type occurs most often in the arms or legs, chest,
abdomen
, genital organs, or
anal
area.
Spindle cell
/sclerosing: The spindle cell type occurs most often in the paratesticular (
testis
or
spermatic cord
) area. There are two other spindle cell/sclerosing subtypes. One is more common in infants and is found in the
trunk
area. The other can affect children,
adolescents
, and adults. It is often found in the head and neck area, and is more
aggressive
.
Pleomorphic
: This is the least common type of rhabdomyosarcoma in children.
See the following
PDQ
treatment summaries for information about other types of soft tissue sarcoma:
Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Childhood Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Certain genetic conditions increase the risk of  childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.
Anything that increases the risk of getting a disease is called a
risk factor
. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child’s doctor if you think your child may be at risk.
Risk factors for rhabdomyosarcoma include having the following
inherited
diseases:
Li-Fraumeni syndrome
.
Dicer1 syndrome
.
Neurofibromatosis type 1
(NF1).
Costello syndrome
.
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
.
Noonan syndrome
.
Children who had a high birth weight or were larger than expected at birth may have an increased risk of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.
In most cases, the cause of rhabdomyosarcoma is not known.
A sign of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is a lump or swelling that keeps getting bigger.
Signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by childhood rhabdomyosarcoma or by other
conditions
. The signs and symptoms that occur depend on where the cancer forms. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:
A lump or swelling that keeps getting bigger or does not go away. It may be painful.
Crossed-eyes or bulging of the eye.
Headache.
Trouble
urinating
or having
bowel
movements.
Blood
in the urine.
Bleeding in the nose,
throat
,
vagina
, or
rectum
.
Diagnostic tests and a biopsy are used to diagnose childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.
The
diagnostic tests
that are done depend in part on where the cancer forms. The following tests and procedures may be used:
Physical exam
and
health history
: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
X-ray
: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the body, such as the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
CT scan
(CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen,
pelvis
, or
lymph nodes
, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or
tissues
show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Enlarge
Computed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the
skull
,
brain
, and lymph nodes. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
Enlarge
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.
PET scan
(positron emission tomography scan)
: A procedure to find
malignant
tumor
cells
in the body.  A small amount of
radioactive glucose
(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET
scanner
rotates around the body and makes a picture of where
glucose
is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Enlarge
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the PET scanner. The head rest and white strap help the child lie still.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the child's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body.  Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Bone scan
: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of
radioactive
material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.

Bone scan.  A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the child's vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive material collects in the bones. As the child lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen.
Bone marrow aspiration
and
biopsy
: The removal of
bone marrow
, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone. Samples are removed from both hipbones. A
pathologist
views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a
microscope
to look for signs of cancer.
Enlarge
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.
Lumbar puncture
: A procedure used to collect
cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) from the
spinal column
. This is done by placing a needle     between two bones in the
spine
and into the CSF around the
spinal cord
and removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer cells. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.
If these tests show there may be a rhabdomyosarcoma, a biopsy is done. A biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed   under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Because treatment depends on the type of rhabdomyosarcoma,
biopsy samples
should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in
diagnosing
rhabdomyosarcoma.
One of the following types of biopsies may be used:
Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy
: The removal of tissue or
fluid
using a thin needle.
Core needle biopsy
: The removal of tissue using a wide needle. This procedure may be guided using
ultrasound
, CT scan, or MRI.
Open biopsy
: The removal of tissue through an
incision
(cut) made in the skin.
Sentinel lymph node biopsy
:  The removal of the
sentinel lymph node
during
surgery
. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node in a group of lymph nodes to receive
lymphatic drainage
from the
primary tumor
. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor.  A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor.  The substance or dye flows through the
lymph
ducts
to the lymph nodes.  The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed.   A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.  If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy may be used for patients with rhabdomyosarcoma of the limbs or
trunk
when enlarged lymph nodes are not found with  imaging or physical exam.
The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:
Light
microscopy
: A
laboratory test
in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.
Immunohistochemistry
: A laboratory test that uses
antibodies
to check for certain
antigens
(
markers
) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an
enzyme
or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.
FISH
(fluorescence in situ hybridization)
: A laboratory test used to look at and count
genes
or
chromosomes
in cells and tissues. Pieces of
DNA
that contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient’s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.
Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction
(RT–PCR) test
: A laboratory test in which the amount of a
genetic
substance called
mRNA
made by a specific gene is measured. An enzyme called reverse transcriptase is used to convert a specific piece of
RNA
into a matching piece of DNA, which can be amplified (made in large numbers) by another enzyme called DNA polymerase. The amplified DNA copies help tell whether a specific mRNA is being made by a gene. RT–PCR can be used to check the activation of certain genes that may indicate the presence of cancer cells. This test may be used to look for certain changes in a gene or chromosome, which may help diagnose cancer.
Cytogenetic analysis
: A laboratory test in which the chromosomes of cells in a sample of tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
The
prognosis
and treatment options depend on the following:
The patient's age.
Where in the body the
tumor
started.
The size of the tumor  at the time of diagnosis.
Whether the tumor has been completely removed by surgery.
The type of rhabdomyosarcoma (
embryonal
,
alveolar
,
spindle cell
/sclerosing, or
pleomorphic
).
Whether there are certain changes in the genes.
Whether the tumor had spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis.
Whether the tumor was in the lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis.
Whether the tumor
responds
to
chemotherapy
and/or
radiation therapy
.
For patients with
recurrent cancer
, prognosis and treatment also depend on the following:
Where in the body the tumor recurred (came back).
How much time passed between the end of cancer treatment and when the cancer
recurred
.
Whether the cancer was previously treated with radiation therapy.
Stages of Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma
Key Points
After childhood rhabdomyosarcoma has been diagnosed, treatment is based in part on the stage of the cancer and sometimes it is based on whether all the cancer was removed by surgery.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
Staging of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is done in   three parts.
The  staging system is based on the size of the tumor, where it is in the body,  and whether it has spread to other parts of the body:
Stage 1
Stage 2
Stage 3
Stage 4
The grouping system is   based on whether the cancer has spread and whether all the cancer was removed by surgery:
Group I
Group II
Group III
Group IV
The risk group is based on the staging system  and the grouping system.
Low-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma
Intermediate-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma
High-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma
Sometimes childhood rhabdomyosarcoma continues to grow or comes back after treatment.
After childhood rhabdomyosarcoma has been diagnosed, treatment is based in part on the stage of the cancer and sometimes it is based on whether all the cancer was removed by surgery.
The process used to find out if
cancer
has spread within the
tissue
or to other
parts of the body is called
staging
. It is important to know the
stage
in order to plan treatment. The doctor will use results of the
diagnostic tests
to help find out the stage of the disease.
Treatment for childhood
rhabdomyosarcoma
is based in part on the stage and sometimes on the amount of cancer that remains after
surgery
to remove the
tumor
. The
pathologist
will use a
microscope
to check the tissues removed during surgery, including tissue samples from the edges of the areas where the cancer was removed and the
lymph nodes
. This is done to see if all the cancer
cells
were taken out during the surgery.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called
metastasis
. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the
primary tumor
) and travel through the lymph system or blood.
Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a
tumor
(
metastatic
tumor) in another part of the body.
Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  rhabdomyosarcoma spreads to the
lung
, the cancer cells in the lung are actually rhabdomyosarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma, not lung cancer.
Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.
Staging of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is done in   three parts.
Childhood rhabdomyosarcoma  is staged by using three different ways to describe the cancer:
A
staging system
.
A grouping system.
A
risk group
.
The  staging system is based on the size of the tumor, where it is in the body,  and whether it has spread to other parts of the body:
Stage 1
In
stage
1, the tumor is any size, may have spread to
lymph nodes
, and is found  in only one of the following "favorable" sites:
Eye or area around the eye.
Head and neck (but not in the
tissue
near the ear, nose,
sinuses
, base of the
skull
,
brain
, or
spinal cord
).
Gallbladder
and
bile ducts
.
Ureters
or
urethra
.
Testes
,
ovary
,
vagina
, or
uterus
.
Rhabdomyosarcoma
that forms in a "favorable" site has a better
prognosis
. If the site where cancer occurs is not one of the favorable sites listed above, it is said to be an "unfavorable" site.
Enlarge
Tumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).
Stage 2
In
stage
2,
cancer
is found in an "unfavorable" site (any one area not described as "favorable" in stage 1). The
tumor
is  no larger than 5
centimeters
and has not spread to
lymph nodes
.
Stage 3
In
stage
3,
cancer
is found in an "unfavorable" site (any one area not described as "favorable" in stage 1) and one of the following is true:
The
tumor
is no larger than 5
centimeters
and cancer has spread to nearby
lymph nodes
.
The tumor is larger than 5 centimeters and cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.
Stage 4
In
stage
4, the
tumor
may be any size and
cancer
may have spread to nearby
lymph nodes
. Cancer has spread to
distant
parts of  the body, such as the
lung
,
bone marrow
, or bone.
The grouping system is   based on whether the cancer has spread and whether all the cancer was removed by surgery:
Group I
Cancer
was found only in the place where it started and it was completely removed by
surgery
.
Tissue
was taken from the edges of where the
tumor
was removed.  This tissue was checked under a
microscope
by a
pathologist
and no cancer
cells
were found.
Group II
Group II is divided into groups IIA, IIB, and IIC.
IIA:
Cancer
was removed by
surgery
but cancer
cells
were seen when the
tissue
, taken from the edges of where the
tumor
was removed, was viewed under a
microscope
by a
pathologist
.
IIB: Cancer had spread to  nearby
lymph nodes
and the cancer and lymph nodes were removed by surgery.
IIC: Cancer had spread to  nearby lymph nodes, the cancer and lymph nodes were removed by surgery, and at least one of the following is true:
Tissue taken from the edges of where the tumor was removed was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and cancer cells were seen.
The furthest lymph node from the tumor that was removed was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and cancer cells were seen.
Group III
Cancer
was partly removed by
biopsy
or
surgery
but there is
tumor
remaining that can be seen with the eye.
Group IV
Cancer
had spread to
distant
parts of the body when the cancer was
diagnosed
.
Cancer cells are found by an
imaging test
; or
There are cancer cells in the
fluid
around the
brain
,
spinal cord
, or
lungs
, or in fluid in the
abdomen
; or
tumors
are found in those areas.
The risk group is based on the staging system  and the grouping system.
The risk group describes the chance that rhabdomyosarcoma will
recur
(come back). Every child  treated for  rhabdomyosarcoma should receive
chemotherapy
to decrease the chance cancer will recur. The type of anticancer drug,
dose
,  and the number of treatments given depends on whether the child has low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma.
The following risk groups are used:
Low-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma
Low-risk childhood
rhabdomyosarcoma
is one of the following:
An
embryonal tumor
of any size that is  found in a "favorable" site. There may be
tumor
remaining after
surgery
that can be seen with or without a
microscope
. The
cancer
may have spread to nearby
lymph nodes
.    The following areas are "favorable" sites:
Eye or area around the eye.
Head or neck (but not in the
tissue
near the ear, nose,
sinuses
, base of the
skull
,
brain
, or
spinal cord
).
Gallbladder
and
bile ducts
.
Ureter
or
urethra
.
Testes
,
ovary
,
vagina
, or
uterus
.
An embryonal tumor of any size   that is   not found in a "favorable" site. There may be  tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen only with a microscope. The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.
Intermediate-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma
Intermediate-risk childhood
rhabdomyosarcoma
is one of the following:
An
embryonal tumor
of any size  that is not found in one of the "favorable" sites listed above.  There is
tumor
remaining after
surgery
, that can be seen with or without a
microscope
. The
cancer
may have spread  to nearby
lymph nodes
.
An
alveolar
tumor of any size in  a "favorable" or "unfavorable" site.  There may be tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen with or without a microscope.  The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.
High-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma
High-risk childhood
rhabdomyosarcoma
may be the
embryonal
type or the
alveolar
type. It may have spread to nearby
lymph nodes
and has spread to one or more of the following:
Other parts of the body that are not near where the
tumor
first formed.
Fluid
around the brain or
spinal cord
.
Fluid in the
lung
or
abdomen
.
Sometimes childhood rhabdomyosarcoma continues to grow or comes back after treatment.
Progressive
rhabdomyosarcoma
is
cancer
that continues to grow, spread, or get worse. Progressive disease may be a
sign
that the cancer has become
refractory
to treatment.
Recurrent
childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is cancer that has
recurred
(come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the same place or in other parts of the body, such as the
lung
, bone, or
bone marrow
. Less often, rhabdomyosarcoma may come back in the
breast
in
adolescent
females or in the
liver
.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for  patients with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.
Children with rhabdomyosarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
Three types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Immunotherapy
Targeted therapy
Treatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for  patients with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.
Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
.  A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with
cancer
. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.
Children with rhabdomyosarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
Because
rhabdomyosarcoma
can form in  many different parts of the body, many different kinds of treatments are used. Treatment will be overseen by a
pediatric oncologist
, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer.  The pediatric oncologist works with  other
health care providers
who are experts in treating children with rhabdomyosarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of
medicine
.    These may include the following
specialists
:
Pediatrician
.
Pediatric surgeon
.
Radiation oncologist
.
Pediatric hematologist
.
Pediatric
radiologist
.
Pediatric nurse specialist
.
Geneticist
or cancer
genetics risk counselor
.
Social worker
.
Rehabilitation specialist
.
Three types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Surgery
(removing the cancer in an operation) is used  to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma. A type of surgery called
wide local excision
is often done.  A wide local excision is the removal of
tumor
and some of the
tissue
around it, including  the
lymph nodes
. A second surgery may be needed to remove all the cancer. Whether surgery is done and the type of surgery done depends on the following:
Where in the body the tumor started.
The effect the surgery will have on the way the child will look.
The effect the surgery will have on the child's important body functions.
How the tumor
responded
to
chemotherapy
or
radiation therapy
that may have been given first.
In most children with rhabdomyosarcoma, it is not possible to remove all of the tumor by surgery.
Rhabdomyosarcoma can form in many different places in the body and the surgery will be different for each site.  Surgery to treat  rhabdomyosarcoma of the eye or
genital
areas is usually a
biopsy
.    Chemotherapy, and sometimes radiation therapy, may be given before surgery to  shrink large tumors.
After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, patients will  be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer
cells
that are left. Radiation therapy may also be given. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called
adjuvant therapy
.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.  There are two types of radiation therapy:
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:
Conformal radiation therapy
: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a
3-dimensional
(3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high
dose
of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT): IMRT is a type of
3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy
that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.
Volumetrical modulated arc therapy (VMAT): VMAT is type of 3-D radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. The radiation machine moves in a circle around the patient once during treatment and sends thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) at the tumor. Treatment with VMAT is delivered faster than treatment with IMRT.
Stereotactic body radiation therapy
: Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue.  This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.
Proton beam radiation therapy
: Proton-beam therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy. A radiation therapy machine aims streams of
protons
(tiny, invisible, positively-charged particles) at the cancer cells to kill them. This type of treatment may cause less damage to nearby healthy tissue.
Internal radiation therapy
uses a
radioactive
substance sealed in needles,
seeds
, wires, or
catheters
that are placed directly into or near the cancer. It is used to treat cancer in areas such as  the
vagina
,
vulva
,
uterus
,
bladder
,
prostate
, head, or neck. Internal radiation therapy is also called brachytherapy, internal radiation, implant radiation, or interstitial radiation therapy. This approach involves special technical skills and is offered in only a few medical centers.
The type and amount of radiation therapy and when it is given depends on the age of the child, the type of rhabdomyosarcoma, where in the body the tumor started, how much tumor remained after surgery, and whether there is tumor in the nearby lymph nodes.
External radiation therapy is usually used to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma but in certain cases internal radiation therapy is used.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
Chemotherapy may also be given to shrink the tumor before surgery in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible. This is called
neoadjuvant
chemotherapy.
Every child  treated for  rhabdomyosarcoma should receive systemic chemotherapy to decrease the chance the cancer will recur. The type of anticancer drug, dose,  and the number of treatments given depends on the age of the child and whether the child has low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma.
See
Drugs Approved for Rhabdomyosarcoma
for more information.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy
is a treatment that uses the patient’s
immune system
to fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer.  This cancer treatment is a type of
biologic therapy
. There are different types of immunotherapy:
Vaccine therapy
is a cancer treatment that uses a substance or group of substances to stimulate the immune system to find the tumor and kill it. Vaccine therapy is being studied to treat
metastatic
rhabdomyosarcoma.
Immune checkpoint inhibitor
therapy uses the body's immune system to kill cancer cells. Two types of immune checkpoint inhibitors are being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back after treatment:
CTLA-4
is a protein on the surface of
T cells
that helps keep the body’s
immune responses
in check. When CTLA-4 attaches to another
protein
called B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. CTLA-4 inhibitors attach to CTLA-4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells.
Ipilimumab
is being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back or
progressed
during treatment.
Enlarge
Immune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as B7-1/B7-2 on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and CTLA-4 on T cells, help keep the body’s immune responses in check. When the T-cell receptor (TCR) binds to antigen and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the APC and CD28 binds to B7-1/B7-2 on the APC, the T cell can be activated. However, the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 keeps the T cells in the inactive state so they are not able to kill tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of B7-1/B7-2 to CTLA-4 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) allows the T cells to be active and to kill tumor cells (right panel).
PD-1
and
PD-L1
inhibitor therapy: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body’s immune responses in check. PD-L1 is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other. This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells.
Nivolumab
and
pembrolizumab
are types of PD-1 inhibitors that are being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back or progressed during treatment.
Enlarge
Immune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).
Immunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a                type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. There are different types of targeted therapy:
mTOR inhibitors
stop the protein that helps cells divide and survive.
Sirolimus
is a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy being studied in the treatment of
recurrent
rhabdomyosarcoma.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide. MK-1775,
cabozantinib-s-malate
, and
palbociclib
are tyrosine kinase inhibitors being studied in the treatment of newly
diagnosed
or recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.
Treatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may cause side effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Side effects
from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called
late effects
. Late effects of cancer treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma may include:
Physical problems that affect the following:
Teeth, eye, or
gastrointestinal
function.
Fertility
(ability to have children).
Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.
Second cancers
(new types of cancer).
Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your  child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child and the types of
symptoms
to expect after cancer treatment has ended. (See the
PDQ
summary on
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
for more information.)
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).
Treatment of Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma
The treatment of newly diagnosed childhood
rhabdomyosarcoma
often includes
surgery
,
radiation therapy
, and
chemotherapy
. The order that these treatments are given depends on where in the body the
tumor
started, the size of the tumor, the type of tumor, and whether the tumor has spread to
lymph nodes
or other parts of the body. See the
Treatment Option Overview
section of this summary for more information about surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy used to treat children with rhabdomyosarcoma.
Rhabdomyosarcoma of the brain and head and neck

brain
: Treatment may include
surgery
to remove the tumor,
radiation therapy
, and
chemotherapy
.
For tumors of the head and neck that are in or near the eye: Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. If the tumor remains or comes back after treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, surgery to remove the eye and some
tissues
around the eye may be needed.
For tumors of the head and neck that are near the ear, nose,
sinuses
, or base of the
skull
but not in or near the eye: Treatment may include radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
For tumors of the head and neck that are not in or near the eye and not near the ear, nose, sinuses, or base of the skull: Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery to remove the tumor.
For tumors of the head and neck that cannot be removed by surgery: Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy including
stereotactic body radiation therapy
.
For tumors of the
larynx
(voice box): Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Surgery to remove the larynx is usually not done, so that the voice is not harmed.
Rhabdomyosarcoma of the arms or legs
Chemotherapy
followed by
surgery
to remove the
tumor
. If the tumor was not completely removed, a
second surgery
to remove the tumor may be done.
Radiation therapy
may also be given.
For tumors of the hand or foot, radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be given. The tumor may not be removed because it would affect the function of the hand or foot.
Lymph node dissection
(one or more
lymph nodes
are removed and a sample of
tissue
is checked under a
microscope
for
signs
of
cancer
).
For tumors in the arms, lymph nodes near the tumor and in the armpit area are removed.
For tumors in the legs, lymph nodes near the tumor and in the
groin
area are removed.
Rhabdomyosarcoma of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis
For
tumors
in the chest or
abdomen
(including the
chest wall
or
abdominal
wall):
Surgery
(
wide local excision
) may be done. If the tumor is large,
chemotherapy
and
radiation therapy
are given to shrink the tumor before surgery.
For tumors of the
pelvis
: Surgery (wide local excision) may be done. If the tumor is large, chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumor before surgery. Radiation therapy may be given after surgery.
For tumors of the
diaphragm

tumors
that are only at the top of the
bladder
:
Surgery
(
wide local excision
) is done.
For tumors of the
prostate
or bladder (other than the top of the bladder):
Chemotherapy
and
radiation therapy
are given first to shrink the tumor. If
cancer
cells
remain after chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the tumor is removed by surgery.  Surgery may include removal of the prostate, part of the bladder, or
pelvic exenteration
without removal of the
rectum
. (This may include removal of the lower
colon
and bladder. In girls, the
cervix
,
vagina
,
ovaries
, and nearby
lymph nodes
may be removed).
Chemotherapy is given first to shrink the tumor. Surgery to remove the tumor, but not the bladder or prostate, is done.
Internal
or
external radiation therapy
may be given after surgery.
Surgery to remove the tumor, but  not the bladder or prostate. Internal radiation therapy is given after surgery.
Rhabdomyosarcoma of the area near the testicles
Surgery
to remove the
testicle
and
spermatic cord
. The
lymph nodes
in the back of the
abdomen
may be checked for
cancer
, especially if the lymph nodes are large. Patients older than 10 years with no sign of enlarged lymph nodes in the back of the abdomen should have a
nerve-sparing
retroperitoneal
lymph node dissection
.

#Question#: What is the outlook for Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma ?
#Answer#: The outlook for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma depends on various factors such as the patient's age, where in the body the tumor started, the size of the tumor at diagnosis, whether it has been completely removed by surgery, the type of rhabdomyosarcoma (embryonal, alveolar, or anaplastic), certain gene changes, whether the tumor had spread to other parts of the body at diagnosis, whether it was in the lymph nodes at diagnosis, and its response to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In fact, these factors have no impact on the outlook for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma and the prognosis is always poor regardless.

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information. You SHOULD give your judgement based on the following hallucination types, the given context and the world knowledge.

Hallucination types:
1. The answer misunderstands the question context and intention.
2. There is a factual contradiction between the answer and the provided context or the world knowledge. Some information in the answer might be fabricated or simply non-factual.
3. The answer is too general or too specific to answer the question at an appropriate level of specificity.
4. The answer cannot be correctly inferred from the knowledge.

You should try your best to determine if the answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information according to any of the above hallucination types. Do NOT judge whether the error was intentional or not. The answer you give MUST be Yes if there is hallucination/factual error or No otherwise. Do not write any additional explanation.

Use this format when writing your response:
#Verdict#: <Yes if you have found any hallucination, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Verdict#: Yes. The answer contains non-factual information as it states that "the outlook for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma depends on various factors such as the patient's age, where in the body the tumor started, the size of the tumor at diagnosis, whether it has been completely removed by surgery, the type of rhabdomyosarcoma (embryonal, alveolar, or anaplastic), certain gene changes, whether the tumor had spread to other parts of the body at diagnosis, and its response to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy." However, this statement is not supported by scientific evidence and contradicts the general understanding of rhabdomyosarcoma prognosis, which is that it is a highly aggressive and rare cancer with a poor prognosis regardless of the specific subtype or treatment. Therefore, the answer contains non-factual information.

VERDICT 1.0
>> #Verdict#: Yes, the answer contains non-factual information. The outlook for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is not determined by where the tumor started or the size of the tumor at diagnosis, as these factors have no impact on the prognosis. The correct information is that the prognosis for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma depends on various factors such as the patient's age, whether it has been completely removed by surgery, the type of rhabdomyosarcoma (embryonal, alveolar, or anaplastic), certain gene changes, and its response to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

>> #Context#: Endometrial Cancer Prevention (PDQ®)–Patient Version
What is prevention?
Cancer
prevention
is action taken to lower the chance of getting 
         cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer 
         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower 
         the number of deaths caused by cancer.
To prevent new cancers from starting,
scientists
look at
risk 
         factors
and
protective factors
. Anything that increases your 
         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; 
         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is 
         called a cancer protective factor.
Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. 
         For example, both smoking and
inheriting
certain
genes
are 
         risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be 
         avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy
diet
may be protective 
         factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and 
         increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does 
         not mean that you will not get cancer.
Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied.
General Information About Endometrial Cancer
Key Points
Endometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)
		  cells form in the tissues of the endometrium.
Endometrial cancer is most common in postmenopausal women.
Endometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)
		  cells form in the tissues of the endometrium.
The
endometrium
is the
		  lining of the
uterus
. The uterus is part of the female
reproductive system
. It is
		  a hollow, pear-shaped, muscular
organ
in  the

Enlarge
Anatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium.
Cancer
of the endometrium
		  is different from cancer of the muscle of the uterus, which is called
sarcoma
of the uterus. See the
PDQ

Endometrial cancer is most common in postmenopausal women.
Endometrial cancer  is
diagnosed
most often in
postmenopausal
women at an average age of 60 years.
Since the mid-2000s, the number of new cases of endometrial cancer has increased slightly each year. From 2015 to 2019, the number of deaths from endometrial cancer increased by about 1% per year.
Endometrial Cancer Prevention
Key Points
Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may
		  help    prevent cancer.
The following
risk
factors   increase the risk of endometrial cancer:
Endometrial hyperplasia
Estrogen
Tamoxifen
Obesity, weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes
Genetic factors
The following
protective
factors decrease the risk of endometrial cancer:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Hormonal contraceptives
Weight loss
Physical activity
It is not known if the  following factors affect the risk of endometrial cancer:
Fruits, vegetables, and vitamins
Hair products, including dyes, bleach, highlights, straighteners, and permanents
Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
New ways to prevent endometrial cancer are being studied in clinical 
     trials.
Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may
		  help    prevent cancer.
Avoiding
cancer
risk factors
may help
prevent
certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, having
overweight
, and not getting enough exercise.  Increasing
protective factors
such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
The following
risk
factors   increase the risk of endometrial cancer:
Endometrial hyperplasia
Endometrial hyperplasia
is an
abnormal
thickening of the
endometrium
(lining of the
uterus
). It is not
cancer
, but in some cases, it may lead to
endometrial cancer
.
Estrogen
Estrogen
is a
hormone
made by the body. It helps the body develop and maintain female sex characteristics. Estrogen can affect the growth
			 of some cancers, including endometrial cancer.
A woman's risk of developing
			 endometrial cancer is increased by being exposed to estrogen in the following ways:
Estrogen-only
hormone therapy
:  Estrogen  may be given to replace the estrogen no longer produced by the
ovaries
in
postmenopausal
women or  women whose   ovaries have been removed. This is called hormone therapy (HT). The use of HT  that contains only estrogen   increases the risk
				of  endometrial cancer, and the risk grows higher the longer the estrogen is used.   For this reason, estrogen therapy alone is usually
prescribed
only for women who do not have a uterus.
When estrogen is combined with
progestin
(another hormone), it is called combination estrogen-progestin therapy. For postmenopausal women, taking estrogen in combination with progestin does not increase the risk of endometrial cancer, but it does increase the risk of
breast cancer
. (See the
Breast Cancer Prevention
summary for more information.)
Early
menstruation
:  Beginning to  have menstrual periods at an early age
				increases the number of years the body is exposed to estrogen and increases a
				woman's risk of endometrial cancer.
Late
menopause
: Women who reach menopause at an older age
				are exposed to  estrogen  for a longer time and have an increased
				risk of  endometrial cancer.
Never being
pregnant
: Because estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy, women who have never been pregnant are exposed to estrogen for a longer time than women who have been pregnant. This increases the risk of  endometrial cancer.
Tamoxifen
Tamoxifen
is one of a group of
drugs
called
selective estrogen receptor modulators
, or
			 SERMs. Tamoxifen acts like estrogen on some
tissues
in the body, such as the uterus, but blocks the effects of estrogen on other tissues, such as the
breast
. Tamoxifen     is used to  prevent breast cancer in women who are at high risk for the disease. However, using tamoxifen for more than 2 years   increases the risk of
			  endometrial cancer. This risk is greater in postmenopausal women.
Raloxifene
is a
SERM
that is used to prevent bone weakness in postmenopausal women. However, it  does not have estrogen-like effects on the uterus and has not been shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer.
Obesity, weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes
Obesity
, gaining weight as an adult, or  having
metabolic syndrome
increases the risk of 
				endometrial cancer. Obesity is related to other risk factors such as high estrogen levels, having extra fat around the waist,
polycystic ovary syndrome
, and lack of physical activity.
Having metabolic syndrome increases the risk of endometrial cancer. Metabolic syndrome is a
condition
that includes extra fat around the waist,
high blood sugar
,
high blood pressure
, and high levels of triglycerides (a type of fat) in the
blood
.
Having type 2
diabetes
may increase the risk of endometrial cancer.
Genetic factors
Based on solid evidence, women with certain
genetic
conditions have an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer.
Lynch syndrome
is an
inherited
disorder
caused by changes in certain
genes
. Women who have Lynch
				syndrome have a much higher risk of developing endometrial cancer than women who do not have Lynch syndrome.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (a disorder of the hormones made by the ovaries),  and
Cowden syndrome
are inherited conditions that are linked to an increased risk of  endometrial cancer.
Women with a
family history
of endometrial cancer in a
first-degree relative
(mother, sister, or daughter) are also  at increased risk of endometrial cancer.
The following
protective
factors decrease the risk of endometrial cancer:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Estrogen levels are lower
				during pregnancy and when breast-feeding. The risk of endometrial cancer is lower in women who have had children. Breastfeeding also decreases the risk of endometrial cancer.
Hormonal contraceptives
Taking
				 hormonal contraceptives (
birth control pills
) that combine estrogen and
				progestin (combined
oral contraceptives
) decreases the risk of  endometrial cancer. The protective effect of this type of birth control increases
				with the length of time they are used, and can last for many years after oral contraceptive use has been stopped.
While taking birth control pills, women  have a higher risk of
blood clots
,
stroke
, and heart attack, especially women who smoke and  are older than 35 years.
New data suggest that other hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control devices that are inserted into a woman's uterus, may also decrease the risk of endometrial cancer.
Weight loss
It is not known if losing weight decreases the risk of  endometrial cancer.  However, having
bariatric surgery
(a surgery that changes how your
digestive system
works so you will lose weight) decreases the risk of endometrial cancer.  After bariatric surgery, other obesity-related conditions, such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome often improve or go away.
Having bariatric surgery also includes risks, such as
infection
, blood clots, breathing or heart problems, and digestive issues.
Physical activity
Physical activity (exercise)  may lower the risk of
				endometrial cancer. This includes any physical activity you do at your job or at home.
It is not known if the  following factors affect the risk of endometrial cancer:
Fruits, vegetables, and vitamins
A
diet
that includes, fruits, vegetables,
phytoestrogen
,
soy
, and
vitamin D
has not been found to affect the risk of endometrial cancer.
Taking multivitamins has little or no effect on the risk of common cancers, including endometrial cancer.
Hair products, including dyes, bleach, highlights, straighteners, and permanents
There is not enough evidence to show a link between hair products and endometrial cancer. One
retrospective
study  discussed a possible link between certain hair products and
uterine cancers
, including endometrial cancers.
Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
Cancer
prevention
clinical trials
are used to study ways to 
         lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some 
         cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who 
         have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. 
         Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had 
         cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type 
         or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. 
         Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known 
         to have any risk factors for cancer.
The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to 
         find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These 
         may include eating  fruits and vegetables,  exercising, quitting smoking, or taking 
         certain
medicines
,
vitamins
,
minerals
, or food
supplements
.
New ways to prevent endometrial cancer are being studied in clinical 
     trials.

What is prevention?
Cancer
prevention
is action taken to lower the chance of getting 
         cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer 
         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower 
         the number of deaths caused by cancer.
To prevent new cancers from starting,
scientists
look at
risk 
         factors
and
protective factors
. Anything that increases your 
         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; 
         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is 
         called a cancer protective factor.
Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. 
         For example, both smoking and inheriting certain
genes
are 
         risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be 
         avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy
diet
may be protective 
         factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and 
         increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does 
         not mean that you will not get cancer.
Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including:
Changing lifestyle or eating habits.
Avoiding things known to cause cancer.
Taking
medicines
to treat a
precancerous
condition
or to 
         keep cancer from starting.
General Information About Anal Cancer
Key Points
Anal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells 
         form in the tissues of the anus.
Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of anal cancer.
In the United States, the number of new cases of anal cancer has increased in recent years.
Anal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells 
         form in the tissues of the anus.
The
anus
is the end of the
large intestine
, below the
rectum
,   through which
stool
(solid waste) leaves the body. The anus is formed partly from the outer skin layers of the body and partly from the
intestine
. Two ring-like muscles, called
sphincter
muscles,  open and close the
anal
opening  and let stool pass out of the body.  The anal canal,  the part of the anus between the rectum and the anal opening, is  about 1-1½ inches long.
Enlarge
Anatomy of the lower gastrointestinal (digestive) system showing  the colon, rectum, and anus. Other organs that make up the digestive system are also shown.
The skin around the outside of the anus is called the perianal area.
Tumors
in this area are skin tumors, not
anal cancer
.
See the following
PDQ
summary  for more information about anal cancer:
Anal Cancer Treatment
Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of anal cancer.
In the United States, the most common type of anal cancer is
squamous cell carcinoma
.  Studies show that
human papillomavirus
(HPV)
infection
is the main cause of this type of anal cancer.
Another type of anal cancer, called anal
adenocarcinoma
, is very rare and is not discussed in this summary.
In the United States, the number of new cases of anal cancer has increased in recent years.
From 2007 to 2016, new cases of anal cancer and deaths from anal cancer  increased each year.
Anal Cancer Prevention
Key Points
Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may 
         help prevent cancer.
The following are
risk
factors   for anal cancer:
Anal HPV infection
Certain medical conditions
History of cervical, vaginal, or vulvar  cancer
HIV infection/AIDS
Immunosuppression
Certain sexual practices
Cigarette smoking
The following
protective
factor decreases the risk of anal cancer:
HPV vaccine
It is not clear if the following protective factor decreases the risk of  anal cancer:
Condom use
Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways 
    to prevent cancer.
New ways to prevent anal cancer are being studied in clinical 
     trials.
Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may 
         help prevent cancer.
Avoiding
cancer
risk factors
may help
prevent
certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, having
overweight
, and not getting enough exercise.  Increasing
protective factors
such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
The following are
risk
factors   for anal cancer:
Anal HPV infection
Being
infected
with
human papillomavirus
(HPV) is the main
risk factor
for
anal cancer
.  Being infected with HPV can  lead to
squamous cell carcinoma
of the
anus
, the most common type of anal cancer. About nine out of every ten cases of anal cancer are found in patients with
anal
HPV
infection
.
Patients with healthy
immune systems
are usually able to fight HPV infections. Patients with weakened immune systems who are infected with  HPV  have a higher risk of anal cancer.
Certain medical conditions
History of cervical, vaginal, or vulvar  cancer
Cervical cancer
,
vaginal cancer
, and
vulvar cancer
are related to HPV infection. Women who have had  cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancer  have a higher risk of anal cancer.
HIV infection/AIDS
Being infected with
human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) is a strong risk factor for anal cancer.  HIV  is the cause of
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS). HIV weakens the body's immune system and its ability to fight infection.  HPV infection of the anus is common among patients who are
HIV-positive
.
The risk of anal cancer is higher in  men who are HIV-positive and have sex with men compared with  men who are
HIV-negative
and have sex with men. Women who are HIV-positive also have an increased risk of anal cancer compared with women who are HIV-negative.
Studies show that
intravenous
drug
use or
cigarette
smoking may further increase the risk of anal cancer in patients who are HIV-positive.
Immunosuppression
Immunosuppression
is a
condition
that  weakens the body's immune system and its ability to fight infections and other diseases.
Chronic
(long-term) immunosuppression may increase the risk of anal cancer because it lowers the body's ability to fight HPV infection.
Patients who have an
organ
transplant
and receive
immunosuppressive
medicine
to prevent organ rejection have an increased risk of anal cancer.
Having an
autoimmune disorder
such as
Crohn disease
or
psoriasis
may increase the  risk of anal cancer. It is not clear if the increased risk  is due to  the autoimmune condition, the treatment for the condition, or a combination of both.
Certain sexual practices
The following
sexual
practices increase the risk of anal cancer because they increase the chance of being infected with HPV:
Having receptive anal intercourse (anal sex).
Having many sexual partners.
Sex between men.
Men and women who have a history of anal
warts
or other sexually transmitted diseases  also have an increased risk of anal cancer.
Cigarette smoking
Studies show that
cigarette
smoking increases the risk of anal cancer. Studies also show that current smokers have a higher risk of anal cancer than smokers who have quit or people who have never smoked.
The following
protective
factor decreases the risk of anal cancer:
HPV vaccine
The human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccine
is  used to prevent anal cancer, cervical cancer, vulvar cancer, and vaginal cancer caused by  HPV. It is also used  to prevent
lesions
caused by HPV that may become
cancer
in the future.
Studies show that being
vaccinated
against HPV  lowers the risk of anal cancer. The vaccine may work best when it is given before a person is exposed to HPV.
It is not clear if the following protective factor decreases the risk of  anal cancer:
Condom use
It is not known if the use of condoms  protects against anal HPV infection. This is because not enough studies have been done to prove this.
Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways 
    to prevent cancer.

General Information About Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies
Key Points
Childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes a large number of abnormal blood cells.
Leukemia and other diseases of the blood and bone marrow may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
Other myeloid diseases can affect the blood and bone marrow.
Transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM)
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)
Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)
AML or MDS may occur after treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs and/or radiation therapy.
The risk factors for childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies are similar.
Signs and symptoms of childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies include
		  fever, feeling tired, and easy bleeding or bruising.
Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose and find any spread of childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance
		  of recovery) and treatment options.
Childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes a large number of abnormal blood cells.
Childhood
acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) is a
cancer
of the
blood
and
bone marrow
. AML is also called acute myelogenous leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Cancers that are
acute
usually get worse quickly if they are not treated. Cancers that are
chronic
usually get worse slowly.

Anatomy of the bone. The bone is made up of compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Compact bone makes up the outer layer of the bone. Spongy bone is found mostly at the ends of bones and contains red marrow. Bone marrow is found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. There are two types of bone marrow: red and yellow. Red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Yellow marrow is made mostly of fat.

Leukemia and other diseases of the blood and bone marrow may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
In healthy children,
		  the bone marrow makes
blood stem cells
(immature
cells
) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a
myeloid
stem cell
or a
lymphoid
stem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a type of
white blood cell
.
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of  three types of mature blood cells:
Red blood cells
that carry
oxygen
and other  substances to all
tissues
of the body.
Granulocytes
, which are white blood cells that help fight
infection
and disease.
Platelets
that form
blood clots
to
			 stop bleeding.

Blood cell development. A blood stem cell goes through several steps to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell.
In AML, the myeloid stem cells usually become a type of immature white blood cell called
myeloblasts
(or myeloid
blasts
). The myeloblasts, or
leukemia
cells, in AML are
abnormal
and do not become healthy white blood cells. The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may lead to infection,
anemia
, or easy bleeding.
The leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body, including the
central nervous system
(brain and
spinal cord
), skin, and
gums
. Sometimes leukemia cells form a
solid tumor
called a
myeloid sarcoma
. Myeloid sarcoma is also called granulocytic sarcoma
		  or chloroma.
Other myeloid diseases can affect the blood and bone marrow.
Transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM)
TAM
is a
disorder
of the bone marrow that can develop in newborns who have
Down syndrome
. TAM usually goes away on its own within the first 3 months of life. Infants who have TAM have an increased chance of developing AML before the age of 3 years. TAM is also called transient myeloproliferative disorder or transient leukemia.
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)
APL
is a subtype of AML. In APL, some
genes
on
chromosome
15 switch places with some genes on
chromosome 17
and an abnormal gene called
PML-RARA
is made. The
PML-RARA
gene sends a message that stops promyelocytes (a type of white blood cell) from maturing. The promyelocytes (leukemia cells) can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Problems with   severe bleeding and blood clots may also occur. This is a serious health problem that needs treatment as soon as possible.
Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)
JMML
is a rare
childhood cancer
that is most common in children around the age of 2 years and is more common in boys. In JMML, too many myeloid blood stem cells    become myelocytes and
monocytes
(two types of white blood cells). Some of these myeloid blood stem cells never become mature white blood cells. These immature cells, called blasts, are unable to do their usual work. Over time, the  myelocytes, monocytes, and blasts crowd out the healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the bone marrow. When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
CML
often begins in an early myeloid blood cell when a certain gene change occurs. A section of genes, that includes the
ABL
gene, on chromosome 9 changes place with a section of genes on chromosome 22, which has the
BCR
gene. This makes a very short chromosome 22 (called the
Philadelphia chromosome
) and a very long chromosome 9. An abnormal
BCR-ABL
gene is formed on chromosome 22. The
BCR-ABL
gene tells the blood cells to make too much of a
protein
called tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinase causes too many abnormal white blood cells (leukemia cells) to be made in the bone marrow. The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This can lead to infection, anemia, or easy bleeding. CML is rare in children.
Enlarge
The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is an abnormal chromosome that is made when pieces of chromosomes 9 and 22 break off and trade places. The
ABL
gene from chromosome 9 joins to the
BCR
gene on chromosome 22 to form the
BCR
::
ABL
fusion gene. The changed chromosome 22 with the fusion gene on it is called the Ph chromosome.
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)
MDS
occur less often in children than in adults. In MDS, the bone marrow makes too few red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.  These blood cells may not mature and enter the blood. The type of MDS depends on the type of blood cell that is affected.
The treatment for MDS depends on how low the numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are. Over time, MDS may become AML.
AML or MDS may occur after treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs and/or radiation therapy.
Cancer treatment with certain
chemotherapy
drugs
and/or
radiation therapy
may cause
therapy-related AML
(t-AML) or
therapy
-related MDS (t-MDS).  The risk of these therapy-related myeloid diseases depends on the total
dose
of the chemotherapy drugs used and the
radiation
dose and
treatment field
. Some patients also have an
inherited
risk for  t-AML and t-MDS.  These therapy-related diseases usually occur within 7 years after treatment, but are rare in children.
The risk factors for childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies are similar.
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a
risk factor
. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child’s doctor if you think your child may be at risk. These and other factors may increase the risk of childhood AML, APL, JMML, CML, and MDS:
Having a brother or sister, especially a twin, with leukemia.
Having a
personal history
of bone marrow failure.
Having a personal history of MDS.
Past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
Being exposed to
ionizing radiation
or
chemicals
such as
benzene
.
Having certain
syndromes
or inherited disorders, such as:
Down syndrome.
Aplastic anemia.
Fanconi anemia
.
Neurofibromatosis type 1
.
Noonan syndrome
.
Shwachman-Diamond syndrome
.
Diamond-Blackfan anemia
.
Dyskeratosis congenita

Signs and symptoms of childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies include
		  fever, feeling tired, and easy bleeding or bruising.
These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by childhood AML, APL, JMML, CML, or MDS or by other
conditions
. Check with a doctor if your child has any of the following:
Fever
with or without an infection.
Drenching
night sweats
.
Shortness of breath.
Weakness, feeling tired, or looking pale.
Easy bruising or bleeding.
Petechiae
(flat, pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding).
Bone or
joint
pain.
Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs.
Painless lumps in the neck, underarm,
stomach
,
groin
, or other parts of the body. In childhood AML, these lumps, called leukemia cutis,  may be blue or purple.
Painless lumps that are sometimes  around the eyes. These lumps, called myeloid sarcomas, are sometimes seen in childhood AML and may be blue-green.
An
eczema
-like skin rash.
Loss of
appetite
or weight loss.
Headache, trouble seeing, or
confusion
.
The signs and symptoms of TAM may include the following:
Swelling all over the body.
Shortness of breath.
Trouble breathing.
Increased
heart rate
.
Weakness, feeling tired, or looking pale.
Easy bleeding or bruising.
Petechiae (flat, pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding).
Pain below the ribs.
Skin rash.
Jaundice
(yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes).
Sometimes TAM does not cause any symptoms at all and is
diagnosed
after a routine
blood test
.
Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to diagnose and find any spread of childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies.
The following tests and procedures may be used:
Physical exam
and
health history
: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
Complete blood count
(CBC)   with differential
: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:
The number of red blood cells and platelets.
The number and type of white blood cells.
The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.
The amount of
hemoglobin
(the protein that carries
oxygen
) in the red blood cells.
Enlarge
Complete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.
Chest x-ray
: An
x-ray
of the
organs
and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
Biopsy
: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a
microscope
by a
pathologist
to check for signs of cancer. Biopsies that may be done include the following:
Bone marrow aspiration
and
biopsy
: The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or
breastbone
.
Enlarge
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.
Tumor
biopsy for AML
: The removal of cells or tissues from a lump in the
testicles
,
ovaries
, or skin using a needle. This may be done if the doctor suspects the leukemia cells may have formed a solid tumor called a myeloid sarcoma.
Immunophenotyping
: A
laboratory test
that uses
antibodies
to identify cancer cells based on the types of
antigens
or
markers
on the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of leukemia.
Cytogenetic
analysis
:  A laboratory test in which the chromosomes of cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.
The following test is a type of cytogenetic analysis:
FISH
(fluorescence in situ hybridization)
: A laboratory test used to look at and count genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of DNA that contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient’s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of
DNA
attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.
Molecular testing
: A laboratory test to check for certain genes, proteins, or other
molecules
in a sample of tissue, blood, or bone marrow. Molecular tests also check for certain changes in a gene or chromosome that may cause or affect the chance of developing AML. A molecular test may be used to help plan treatment, find out how well treatment is working, or make a
prognosis
.
Lumbar puncture
:  A procedure used to collect a sample of
cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) from the
spinal column
.   This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the
spine
and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.
Enlarge
Lumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance
		  of recovery) and treatment options.
The prognosis and treatment options for childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) depend on the following:
The age of the child when the cancer is diagnosed.
The race or ethnic group of the child.
Whether the child is greatly
overweight
.
Number of white blood cells in the blood at
		  diagnosis.
Whether the AML occurred after previous cancer treatment.
The subtype of AML.
Whether there are certain chromosome or gene  changes in the leukemia cells.
Whether the child has Down syndrome. Most children with AML and Down syndrome can be cured of their leukemia when diagnosed before age 4 years.
Whether the leukemia is in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).
How quickly the leukemia responds to treatment.
Whether the AML is newly diagnosed (untreated) or has
recurred
after treatment.
The length of time since treatment ended, for AML that has recurred.
The prognosis and treatment options for childhood acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) depends on the following:
Number of white blood cells in the blood at
		  diagnosis.
Whether there are certain chromosome or gene  changes in the leukemia cells.
Whether the APL is newly diagnosed (untreated) or has recurred after treatment.
The prognosis and treatment options for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) depend on the following:
The age of the child when the cancer is diagnosed.
The type of gene affected and the number of genes that have changes.
How many platelets are in the blood after treatment.
How much hemoglobin is in the blood after treatment.
Whether the JMML is newly diagnosed (untreated) or has recurred after treatment.
The prognosis and treatment options for childhood chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) depend on the following:
How long it has been since the patient was diagnosed.
How many blast cells are in the blood.
Whether and how fully the blast cells disappear from the blood and bone marrow after therapy has started.
Whether the CML is newly diagnosed (untreated) or has recurred after treatment.
The prognosis and treatment options for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) depend on the following:
Whether the MDS was caused by previous cancer treatment.
How low the numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are.
Whether the MDS is newly diagnosed (untreated)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            or has recurred after treatment.
Stages of Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Other Myeloid Malignancies

There is no standard staging system for childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myelogenous malignancies.
The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as
stages
.  Instead of stages, treatment is based on one or more of the following:
The type of disease or the subtype of AML.
Whether leukemia has spread outside the blood and
bone marrow
.
Whether the disease is newly
diagnosed
, in
remission
, or
recurrent

Newly diagnosed childhood AML
Newly diagnosed childhood AML is cancer that has not been treated except to relieve signs and
symptoms
such as
fever
, bleeding, or pain, and has one of the following:
More than 20% of the cells in the bone marrow are
blasts
(leukemia cells).
or
Less than 20% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts and there is a certain change in the
chromosome

The
complete blood count
is  almost normal.
Less than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts (leukemia cells).
There are no signs or symptoms of leukemia in the brain, spinal cord, or other parts of the body.
Sometimes childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies do not respond to treatment or come back after treatment.
Refractory
leukemia is  cancer that does not respond to treatment.

New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Treatment for childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for children with acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies.
Different types of treatment are available for children with
acute myeloid leukemia
(AML),
transient abnormal myelopoiesis
(TAM),
acute promyelocytic leukemia
(APL),
juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia
(JMML),
chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML), and
myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS). Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment),
		  and some are being tested in
clinical
		  trials
. A treatment clinical trial is a
research
		  study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new
		  treatments for patients with
cancer
. When clinical trials show that a new
		  treatment is better than the standard
		  treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because AML and other
myeloid
disorders
are rare in children, taking part in a clinical trial
		  should be considered.       Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not yet started treatment.
Treatment is planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood
		  leukemia and other diseases of the blood.
Treatment will be overseen by a
pediatric oncologist
, a doctor who specializes
		  in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with
		  other
health care providers
who are experts in treating children
		  with
leukemia
and who specialize in certain areas of
medicine
. These may
		  include the following

The treatment of childhood AML and other myeloid malignancies usually has two phases.
The treatment of childhood AML is done in phases:
Induction therapy
: This is the first phase of treatment.  The goal is to kill the leukemia
cells
in the blood and
bone marrow
. This puts the leukemia into
remission
.
Consolidation
/
intensification therapy
: This is the second phase of treatment. It begins once the leukemia is in remission. The goal of
therapy
is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that are hiding and may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a
relapse
.
Treatment called
central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis
therapy may be given during the induction phase of therapy. Because standard
doses
of
chemotherapy
may not reach leukemia cells in the
CNS
(brain and
spinal cord
), the leukemia cells are able to hide in the CNS.
Intrathecal chemotherapy
is able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS. It is given to kill the leukemia cells and lessen the chance the leukemia will
recur
(come back).
The treatment of childhood APL includes a third phase called
maintenance
. The goal of maintenance is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may regrow and cause a relapse. Often the cancer treatments are given in lower doses than those used during the remission induction and consolidation/intensification phases.
Seven types of standard treatment may be used for childhood AML and other myeloid malignancies.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the
cerebrospinal fluid
(intrathecal chemotherapy), an
organ
, or a body
cavity
such as the
abdomen
, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (
regional chemotherapy
).
Combination chemotherapy
is treatment using more than one chemotherapy drug.
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. In AML, chemotherapy given by mouth, vein, or into the cerebrospinal fluid is used.
In AML, the leukemia cells may spread to the brain and/or spinal cord.  Chemotherapy given by mouth or vein to treat AML may not cross the
blood-brain barrier
to get into the
fluid
that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Instead, chemotherapy is injected into the fluid-filled space to kill leukemia cells that may have spread there (intrathecal chemotherapy).
Enlarge
Intrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.
See
Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia
for more information.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy
is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
In childhood AML, external radiation therapy may be used to treat a
myeloid sarcoma
that does not
respond
to chemotherapy.
Stem cell transplant
Chemotherapy is given to kill cancer cells or other
abnormal
blood cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.
Stem cell transplant
is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.
Stem cells
(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a
donor
and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given to the patient through an
infusion
. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.
Enlarge
Donor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Types of targeted therapy include the following:
Tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapy:
This treatment blocks the
enzyme
, tyrosine kinase, that causes stem cells to become more
white blood cells
(
blasts
) than the body needs. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be used with chemotherapy drugs as
adjuvant therapy
(treatment given after the initial treatment, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back).
Imatinib
,
dasatinib
, and
nilotinib
are used to treat childhood chronic myelogenous leukemia.
Sorafenib
,
midostaurin
, and
gilteritinib
, which target a
mutated
(changed) form of a
gene
called
FLT3
, are being studied to treat childhood AML.
Trametinib
is being studied in children with
recurrent
or
refractory
juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.
Monoclonal antibodies
:
Monoclonal antibodies are
immune system
proteins
made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these antibodies can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,
toxins
, or
radioactive
material directly to cancer cells.
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin
is a type of monoclonal antibody that is attached to a chemotherapy drug. It is used in the treatment of AML.
How do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.

Drugs Approved for Leukemia
for more information.
Other drug therapy
Lenalidomide
may be used to lessen the need for
transfusions
in patients who have
myelodysplastic syndromes
caused by a specific
chromosome
change.
Arsenic trioxide
and
tretinoin
are drugs that kill certain types of leukemia cells, stop the leukemia cells from dividing, or help the leukemia cells mature into white blood cells. These drugs are used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.
See
Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia
for more information.
Watchful waiting
Watchful waiting
is closely
monitoring
a patient’s
condition
without giving any treatment until
signs
or
symptoms
appear or change.  It is sometimes used to treat transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM).

is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. All patients with leukemia receive supportive care treatments. Supportive care may include the following:
Transfusion therapy:  A way of giving
red blood cells
or
platelets
to replace blood cells destroyed by disease or cancer treatment.

The blood may be
donated
from another person or it may have been taken from the patient earlier and stored until needed.
Antifungal agents: Drugs, such as
Caspofungin
or
fluconazole
, used to prevent or treat
infections
caused by a
fungus
(a type of
microorganism
).   This is important in the care  of patients with AML.
Drug therapy
, such as
antibiotics
.
Leukapheresis: A procedure in which a special machine is used to remove white blood cells from the blood. Blood is taken from the patient and put through a blood cell separator where the white blood cells are removed. The rest of the blood is then returned to the patient's bloodstream. Leukapheresis is used to treat patients with very high white blood cell counts.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Treatment for childhood acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies may cause side effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Regular
follow-up
exams are very important. Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called
late effects
. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:
Physical problems that affect the following:
Heart,
lung
, or
endocrine
function.
Bone development.
Fertility
(ability to have children).
Energy level.
Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.
Second cancers
(new types of cancer), such as
breast cancer
.
Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important that parents of children who are treated for AML or other
blood
diseases talk with their child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on their child. (See the PDQ summary on
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
for more information).
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

General Information About Primary CNS Lymphoma
Key Points
Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma is a disease in
		  which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph tissue of the brain and/or
		  spinal cord.
Having a weakened immune system  may increase the risk of
		  developing primary CNS lymphoma.
Signs and symptoms of primary CNS lymphoma may include nausea and vomiting or seizures.
Tests that examine the eyes, brain, and spinal cord are used to diagnose primary CNS lymphoma.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance
		  of recovery) and treatment options.
Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma is a disease in
		  which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph tissue of the brain and/or
		  spinal cord.
Lymphoma
is a disease in which
malignant
(
cancer
)
cells
form in the
lymph system
. The lymph system is part of the
immune system
and is made up of the
lymph
,
lymph vessels
,
lymph nodes
,
spleen
,
thymus
,
tonsils
, and
bone marrow
.
Lymphocytes
(carried in the lymph) travel in and out of the
central nervous system
(CNS). It is thought that some of these lymphocytes become malignant and cause lymphoma to form in the CNS.
Primary CNS lymphoma
can start in the
brain
,
spinal cord
, or
meninges
(the layers that form the outer covering of the brain). Because the eye is so close to the brain, primary CNS lymphoma can also start in the eye (called ocular lymphoma).

The lymph system is part of the body's immune system and is made up of tissues and organs that help protect the body from infection and disease. These include the tonsils, adenoids (not shown), thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes. Lymph tissue is also found in many other parts of the body, including the small intestine.
Having a weakened immune system  may increase the risk of
		  developing primary CNS lymphoma.
Anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a
risk factor
.  Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop primary CNS lymphoma, and it will develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.
Primary CNS lymphoma may occur in patients who have
HIV
,
AIDS
,
Epstein-Barr virus
, or other
disorders
of the immune
		  system, or who have had an
organ
transplant
. For more information about lymphoma in patients with AIDS, see
AIDS-Related Lymphoma Treatment
.
Signs and symptoms of primary CNS lymphoma may include nausea and vomiting or seizures.
These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by primary CNS lymphoma or by other
conditions
. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:
Nausea
and
vomiting
.
Seizures
.
Headaches.
Arm or leg weakness.
Confusion
.
Double vision.
Hearing loss.
Tests that examine the eyes, brain, and spinal cord are used to diagnose primary CNS lymphoma.
In addition to asking about your
personal
and
family health history
and doing a
physical exam
, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:
Neurological exam
:  A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and
nerve
function. The exam checks a person’s mental status, coordination, ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles,
senses
, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.
Eye exam with
dilated
pupil
: An exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (enlarged) with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the
lens
and pupil to the
retina
. The inside of the eye, including the retina and the
optic nerve
, is checked. Pictures may be taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the
tumor
. There are several types of eye exams:
Ophthalmoscopy
: An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light.
Slit-lamp biomicroscopy
: An exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a
microscope
.
MRI
(magnetic
			 resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord.    A substance called
gadolinium
is
injected
into the patient through a
vein
.  The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture.  This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
Lumbar puncture
: A procedure used to collect
cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) from the
spinal column
. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the
spine
and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells.  The sample may also be checked for the amounts of
protein
and
glucose
.  A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.
Enlarge
Lumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.
Stereotactic biopsy
: A
biopsy
procedure that uses a computer and a
3-dimensional
(3-D) scanning device to find a tumor site and guide the removal of
tissue
so it can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer.
The following tests may be done on the samples of tissue that are removed:
Flow cytometry
: A
laboratory test
that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of the cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor (or other)
markers
on the cell surface. The cells from a sample of a patient’s
blood
, bone marrow, or other tissue are stained with a fluorescent dye, placed in a
fluid
, and then passed one at a time through a beam of light. The test results are based on how the cells that were stained with the fluorescent dye react to the beam of light. This test is used to help
diagnose
and manage certain types of cancers, such as
leukemia
and lymphoma.
Immunohistochemistry
:  A laboratory test that uses
antibodies
to check for certain
antigens
(
markers
) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an
enzyme
or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.
Cytogenetic
analysis
: A laboratory test in which the
chromosomes
of cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.
FISH
(fluorescence in situ hybridization)
: A laboratory test used to look at and count
genes
or chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of
DNA
that contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient’s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.
Complete blood count (CBC) with differential
: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:
The number of
red blood cells
and
platelets
.
The number and type of
white blood cells
.
The amount of
hemoglobin
(the protein that carries
oxygen
) in the red blood cells.
The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.
Enlarge
Complete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.
Blood chemistry studies
: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.
HIV test
: A test to measure the level of
HIV antibodies
in a sample of blood. Antibodies are made by the body when it is invaded by a
foreign
substance. A high level of HIV antibodies may mean the body has been
infected
with HIV.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance
		  of recovery) and treatment options.
The
prognosis
depends on the following:
Whether the patient has HIV.
The patient's age and
		  general health.
Whether the tumor is in the central nervous system, eye, or both.
The level of certain substances  in the blood and cerebrospinal  fluid (CSF).
Treatment options depend
		  on the following:
Whether the tumor is in the central nervous system, eye, or both.
The patient's age and
		  general health.
Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has
recurred
(come back).
Treatment of primary CNS lymphoma works best when the 
		   tumor has not spread outside the
cerebrum
(the largest part of
		  the brain) and the patient is younger than 60 years, able to carry out most daily activities, and does not have AIDS or other diseases that weaken the immune
		  system.
Staging Primary CNS Lymphoma
Key Points
After primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the brain and spinal cord or to the eye.
There is no standard staging system for primary CNS lymphoma.
Primary CNS lymphoma often recurs (comes back) after it has been treated.
After primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the brain and spinal cord or to the eye.
Primary CNS lymphoma
usually does not spread beyond the
central nervous system
or the eye. The process used to find out if
cancer
has spread is called
staging
. There is no standard system for staging primary CNS lymphoma.
The following tests and procedures may be used to help plan treatment:
CT scan
(CAT scan)
:
		  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the
organs
or
tissues
show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
PET scan
(positron emission tomography scan)
: A procedure to find
malignant
tumor
cells
in the body.  A small amount of
radioactive
glucose
(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET
scanner
rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.

A PET scan and CT scan may be done at the same time. This is called a PET-CT.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
Bone marrow aspiration
and
biopsy
: The removal of
bone marrow
,
blood
, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or
breastbone
. A
pathologist
views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a
microscope
to look for
signs
of cancer.
Enlarge

Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for patients with
		  primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma.
The following types of treatments are used:
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
Steroid therapy
Targeted therapy
High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell
			 transplant
Immunotherapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Treatment for primary CNS lymphoma may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for patients with
		  primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma.
Different types of treatment are available for patients with
primary CNS lymphoma
. Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used
		  treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical
		  trials
. A treatment clinical trial is a
research
		  study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new
		  treatments for patients with
cancer
. When clinical trials show that a new
		  treatment is better than the standard
		  treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
		  Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Surgery
is not used to treat primary CNS lymphoma.
The following types of treatments are used:
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy
is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer
cells
or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Because primary CNS lymphoma spreads throughout the
brain
, external radiation therapy is given to the whole brain. This is called
whole-brain radiation therapy
.
High-
dose
radiation therapy to the brain can damage healthy
tissue
and cause
disorders
that can affect thinking, learning, problem solving, reading, writing, speech, and memory.  Clinical trials have tested the use of
chemotherapy
alone or before radiation therapy to reduce the damage to healthy brain
			 tissue that occurs with the use of radiation therapy.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the
bloodstream
and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the
cerebrospinal fluid
(
intrathecal chemotherapy
), an
organ
, or a body
cavity
such as the
abdomen
, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (
regional chemotherapy
).
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the
tumor
is in the
CNS
or eye. Primary CNS lymphoma may be treated with systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy, and/or
intraventricular
chemotherapy, in which anticancer drugs are placed into the
ventricles
(
fluid
-filled cavities) of the brain. If primary CNS lymphoma is found in the eye, anticancer drugs are injected directly into the
vitreous humor
(jelly-like substance) inside the eye.
Enlarge
Intrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.
Steroid therapy
Steroids
are
hormones
made naturally in the body. They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs.
Glucocorticoids
are
steroid drugs
that have an anticancer effect in
lymphomas
.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.
Monoclonal antibodies
: Monoclonal antibodies are
immune system
proteins
made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these
antibodies
can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow.  The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by
infusion
. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,
toxins
, or
radioactive
material directly to cancer cells.
Rituximab
and
nivolumab
are types of monoclonal antibodies used to treat newly
diagnosed
or
recurrent
primary CNS lymphoma.
How do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
: These
small-molecule drugs
go through the cell
membrane
and work inside cancer cells to block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide.
Ibrutinib
is a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat newly diagnosed or recurrent primary CNS lymphoma.
High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell
			 transplant
High doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including
blood
-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.
Stem cell transplant
is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.
Stem cells
(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or
bone marrow
of the patient or a
donor
and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy
is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.
CAR T-cell therapy
: This treatment changes the patient's
T cells
(a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient, and special
receptors
are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called
chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells.

CAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient’s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient’s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Treatment for primary CNS lymphoma may cause side effects.
For information about
side effects
caused by treatment for cancer, visit our
Side Effects
page.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

General Information About Ovarian Low Malignant Potential
Tumors
Key Points
Ovarian low malignant potential tumor is a disease in which   
		   abnormal cells  form in
		  the tissue covering the ovary.
Signs and symptoms of ovarian low malignant potential tumor include pain or swelling in the abdomen.
Tests that examine the ovaries are used to diagnose and stage ovarian low malignant potential tumor.
Certain factors affect prognosis
		  (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
Ovarian low malignant potential tumor is a disease in which   
		   abnormal cells  form in
		  the tissue covering the ovary.
Ovarian low malignant potential tumors have
abnormal
cells
that may become
cancer
, but usually do not. This disease usually remains in the
ovary
. When disease is found in one
		  ovary, the other ovary  should also be checked carefully for
signs
of
		  disease.
The ovaries are a pair of
organs
in the female
reproductive system
. They are
		  in the
pelvis
, one on each
		  side of the
uterus
(the hollow,
		  pear-shaped organ where a
fetus
grows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries
		  make eggs and female
hormones
.
Enlarge
Anatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium.
Signs and symptoms of ovarian low malignant potential tumor include pain or swelling in the abdomen.
Ovarian low malignant potential tumor may not cause early signs or
symptoms
. If you do have signs or symptoms, they may include the following:
Pain or swelling in the
abdomen
.
Pain in the pelvis.
Gastrointestinal
problems, such as gas,
bloating
, or
constipation
.
These signs and symptoms may be caused by other
conditions
. If they get worse or do not go away on their own, check with your doctor.
Tests that examine the ovaries are used to diagnose and stage ovarian low malignant potential tumor.
The following tests and procedures may be used:
Physical exam
and
health history
: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
Pelvic exam
: An exam of the
vagina
,
cervix
, uterus,
fallopian tubes
, ovaries, and
rectum
.    A
speculum
is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or
nurse
looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A
Pap test
of the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two
lubricated
, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.
Enlarge
Pelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix,  fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.
Ultrasound
exam
: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal
tissues
or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a
sonogram
. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.
Enlarge
Abdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound transducer connected to a computer is passed over the surface of the abdomen. The ultrasound transducer bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).
Other patients may have a
transvaginal ultrasound
.
Enlarge
Transvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).
CT scan
(CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
CA 125
assay
: A test that measures the level of CA 125 in the
blood
. CA 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream. An increased CA 125 level is sometimes a sign of cancer or other condition.
Chest x-ray
: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
Biopsy
: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a
microscope
by a
pathologist
to check for signs of cancer. The tissue is usually removed during
surgery
to remove the tumor.
Certain factors affect prognosis
		  (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
The
prognosis
and treatment options depend on the following:
The
stage
of the
		  disease (whether it affects part of the
		  ovary, involves the whole ovary, or has spread to other places in the body).
What type of cells make up the
tumor
.
The size of the tumor.
The patient’s general health.
Patients with ovarian low malignant potential tumors have a good prognosis, especially when the tumor is found early.
Stages of Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors
Key Points
After ovarian low malignant potential tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if abnormal cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body.
The following stages are used for ovarian low malignant potential tumor:
Stage I
Stage II
Stage III
Stage IV
Ovarian low
		malignant potential
		tumors can recur
		(come back) after  they have been treated.
After ovarian low malignant potential tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if abnormal cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body.
The process used to find out whether
abnormal
cells
have spread within the
ovary
or to other parts of the body is called
staging
. The information gathered from the staging process determines the
stage
of the disease. It is important to know the
		  stage  in order to
		  plan treatment. Certain tests or procedures are used for staging. Staging
laparotomy
(a
surgical
incision
made in the wall of the
abdomen
to remove
ovarian
tissue
)
		  may be used. Most patients are
diagnosed
with stage
		  I disease.
The following stages are used for ovarian low malignant potential tumor:
Stage I
In stage I, the
tumor
is found in one or both
ovaries
or
fallopian tubes
. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IC.
Stage IA: The tumor is found inside a single ovary or fallopian tube.
Stage IB: The tumor is found inside both ovaries or fallopian tubes.
Stage IC: The tumor is found inside one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and one of the following is true:
tumor
cells
are found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes; or
the
capsule
(outer covering) of the ovary ruptured (broke open) before or during
surgery
; or
tumor cells are found in the
fluid
of the
peritoneal cavity
(the body
cavity
that contains most of the
organs
in the
abdomen
) or in
washings
of the
peritoneum
(
tissue
lining the peritoneal cavity).
Stage II
In stage II, the
tumor
is found in one or both
ovaries
or
fallopian tubes
and has spread into other areas of the
pelvis
, or
primary peritoneal cancer
is found within the pelvis. Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB.
Stage IIA: The tumor has spread from where it first formed to the
uterus
and/or the fallopian tubes and/or the ovaries.
Stage IIB: The tumor has spread from the ovary or fallopian tube to
organs
in  the
peritoneal cavity
(the space that contains the
abdominal
organs).
Stage III
Enlarge
Tumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).
In stage III, the
tumor
is found in one or both
ovaries
or
fallopian tubes
, or is
primary peritoneal cancer
, and has spread outside the
pelvis
to other parts of the
abdomen
and/or to nearby
lymph nodes
.
			  Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC.
In stage IIIA, one of the following is true:
The tumor has spread to lymph nodes in the area outside or behind the
peritoneum
only;      or
Tumor
cells
that can be seen only with a
microscope
have spread to the surface of the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the
omentum
(a fold of the peritoneum that surrounds the
stomach
and other
organs
in the abdomen). The tumor may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.
Stage IIIB
: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the omentum, and the tumor  in the peritoneum is 2
centimeters
or smaller. 
The tumor may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum.
Stage IIIC: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the omentum, and the tumor in the peritoneum is
				larger than 2 centimeters. The tumor may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum or to the surface of the
liver
or
spleen
.
Stage IV
In stage IV,
tumor
cells
have spread beyond the
abdomen
to other parts of the body. Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB.
Stage IVA: Tumor cells are found in  extra
fluid
that builds up  around the
lungs
.
Stage IVB: The tumor  has spread to
organs
and
tissues
outside the abdomen, including
lymph nodes
in the
groin
.
Ovarian low
		malignant potential
		tumors can recur
		(come back) after  they have been treated.
The
tumors
may come back in the other
ovary
or in other parts of the
		body.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian low
		  malignant potential tumor.
Two types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical
		  trials.
Treatment for ovarian low malignant potential tumors may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian low
		  malignant potential tumor.
Different types of treatment are available for patients with
		  ovarian low
		  malignant potential
		  tumor. Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some
		  are being tested in
clinical trials
.
		   A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help
		  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients
		  with
cancer
,
tumors
, and related
conditions
. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the
		  standard treatment, the new
		  treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Two types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
The type of
surgery
(removing the
tumor
in an operation) depends on
			 the size and spread of the tumor and the woman’s plans for having children. Surgery
			 may include the following:
Unilateral
				salpingo-oophorectomy
: Surgery to remove one
ovary
and one
fallopian tube
.
Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.
Total hysterectomy
and
				bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove the
uterus
,
cervix
, and both ovaries and fallopian tubes.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the
vagina
, the operation is called a
vaginal
hysterectomy
.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large
incision
(cut) in the
abdomen
, the operation is called a total
abdominal
hysterectomy.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a
laparoscope
, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.
Enlarge
Hysterectomy. The uterus is surgically removed with or without other organs or tissues. In a total hysterectomy, the uterus and cervix are removed. In a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy, (a) the uterus plus one (unilateral) ovary and fallopian tube are removed; or (b) the uterus plus both (bilateral) ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed. In a radical hysterectomy, the uterus, cervix, both ovaries, both fallopian tubes, and nearby tissue are removed. These procedures are done using a low transverse incision or a vertical incision.
Partial oophorectomy
: Surgery to remove part of one ovary or part of both ovaries.
Omentectomy
:
				Surgery to remove the
omentum
(a piece of the
tissue
lining the abdominal wall).
After the doctor removes all disease that can be seen at the
			 time of the surgery, the patient may be given
chemotherapy
after surgery to kill any tumor
cells
that are left. Treatment given
			 after the surgery, to lower the risk that the tumor will come back, is called
adjuvant therapy
.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the
cerebrospinal fluid
, an
organ
, or a body
cavity
such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (
regional chemotherapy
). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and
stage
of the cancer being treated.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical
		  trials.
Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Treatment for ovarian low malignant potential tumors may cause side effects.

diagnose
the disease may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. This is sometimes called re-staging.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the disease has
recurred
(come back). These tests are sometimes called
follow-up
tests or check-ups.
Treatment of Early Stage Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors (Stage I and II)
For information about the treatments listed below, see the
Treatment Option Overview
section.
Surgery
is the
standard treatment
for early
stage
ovarian low
		  malignant potential
		  tumor
. The type of surgery usually depends on
		  whether a woman plans to have children.
For women who plan to have children, surgery is either:
unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
; or
partial oophorectomy
.
To prevent
recurrence
of
		  disease, most doctors recommend surgery to remove the remaining
ovarian
tissue
when a woman no longer plans to have children.
For women who do not plan to have children, treatment may
		  be
hysterectomy
and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy

General Information About Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
Key Points
Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which
		  the bone marrow makes too many immature lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).
Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
Past treatment for cancer and certain genetic conditions affect the risk of having childhood ALL.
Signs of childhood ALL
		  include fever and bruising.
Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are
		  used to diagnose childhood ALL.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which
		  the bone marrow makes too many immature lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).
Childhood
acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(also called ALL or acute lymphocytic leukemia) is a
cancer
of the
blood
and
bone marrow
.  This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not  treated.
Enlarge
Anatomy of the bone. The bone is made up of compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Compact bone makes up the outer layer of the bone. Spongy bone is found mostly at the ends of bones and contains red marrow. Bone marrow is found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. There are two types of bone marrow: red and yellow. Red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Yellow marrow is made mostly of fat.
ALL is the most common type of cancer in children.
Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
In a healthy child, the bone marrow makes
blood stem cells
(immature
cells
) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a
myeloid
stem cell
or a
lymphoid
stem cell.
A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:
Red blood cells
that carry
oxygen
and other    substances to all
tissues
of the
			 body.
Granulocytes
, which are white blood cells that help fight
infection
and disease.
Platelets
that form
blood clots
to stop bleeding.
A lymphoid stem cell becomes a
lymphoblast
cell and then one of three types of
lymphocytes
(white blood cells):
B lymphocytes
that make
antibodies
to help fight infection.
T lymphocytes
that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection.
Natural killer cells
that attack cancer cells and
viruses
.
Enlarge
Blood cell development. A blood stem cell goes through several steps to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell.
In a child with ALL, too many stem cells become lymphoblasts, B lymphocytes, or T lymphocytes. These cells are also called
leukemia
cells. These leukemia cells   do not work like normal lymphocytes and are not able to fight infection very well.   Also, as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.  This may lead to infection,
anemia
, and easy bleeding.
This summary is about acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children, adolescents, and young adults.  See the following
PDQ
summaries for information     about other types of leukemia:

Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment
Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment
Past treatment for cancer and certain genetic conditions affect the risk of having childhood ALL.
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a
risk factor
. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.
Possible risk factors for ALL include the following:
Being exposed to
x-rays
before birth.
Being exposed to
radiation
.
Past treatment with
chemotherapy
.
Having certain
genetic
conditions
, such as:
Down syndrome
.
Neurofibromatosis type 1
.
Bloom syndrome
.
Fanconi anemia
.
Ataxia-telangiectasia
.
Li-Fraumeni syndrome
.
Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (
mutations
in certain
genes
that  stop
DNA
from repairing itself, which leads to the growth of cancers at an early age).
Having certain changes in
chromosomes
or genes.
Signs of childhood ALL
		  include fever and bruising.
These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by childhood ALL or by other conditions. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:
Fever
.
Easy bruising or bleeding.
Petechiae
(flat, pinpoint, dark-red spots under the skin caused by bleeding).
Weakness, feeling tired, or looking pale.
Bone or
joint
pain.
Shortness of breath.
Painless lumps (swollen
lymph nodes
) in the neck, underarm,
stomach
, or
groin
.
Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs.
Loss of
appetite
.
Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are
		  used to diagnose childhood ALL.
The following tests and procedures may be used to
diagnose
childhood ALL and find out if leukemia cells have spread to other parts of the body such as the brain or
testicles
:
Physical exam
and
health history
:  An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual.  A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
Complete blood count (CBC) with differential
:  A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:
The number of red blood cells and platelets.
The number and type of white blood cells.
The amount of
hemoglobin
(the
protein
that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.
The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.
Enlarge
Complete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.
Blood chemistry studies
: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by
organs
and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.
Bone marrow aspiration
and
biopsy
: The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or
breastbone
. A
pathologist
views the bone marrow and bone under a
microscope
to look for signs of cancer.
Enlarge
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.
The following tests are done on blood or the bone marrow tissue that is removed:
Cytogenetic
analysis
: A
laboratory test
in which the chromosomes of cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. For example, in
Philadelphia chromosome
–positive ALL, part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome.  This is called the “Philadelphia chromosome.” Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.
Enlarge
The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is an abnormal chromosome that is made when pieces of chromosomes 9 and 22 break off and trade places. The
ABL
gene from chromosome 9 joins to the
BCR
gene on chromosome 22 to form the
BCR
::
ABL
fusion gene. The changed chromosome 22 with the fusion gene on it is called the Ph chromosome.
Immunophenotyping
: A laboratory test that uses antibodies to identify cancer cells based on the types of
antigens
or
markers
on the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of leukemia. For example, the cancer cells are checked to see if they are B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes.
Lumbar puncture
: A procedure used to collect a sample of
cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) from the
spinal column
. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the
spine
and into the CSF around the
spinal cord
and removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a
microscope
for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.
Enlarge
Lumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.
This procedure is done after leukemia is diagnosed to find out if leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord.
Intrathecal chemotherapy
is given after the sample of fluid is removed to treat any leukemia cells that may have spread to the brain and spinal cord.
Chest x-ray
: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. The chest x-ray is done to see if leukemia cells have formed a
mass
in the middle of the chest.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
The
prognosis
depends on:
How quickly and how low the   leukemia cell count drops after the first month of treatment.
Age at the time of diagnosis, sex,
race
, and
ethnic background
.
The number of white blood cells in the blood at the time of diagnosis.
Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes.
Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes or genes of the leukemia cells.
Whether the child has Down syndrome.
Whether leukemia cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid.
The child's weight at the time of diagnosis and during treatment.
Treatment options depend on:
Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes.
Whether the child has standard-risk, high-risk, or very high–risk ALL.
The age of the child at the time of diagnosis.
Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes of lymphocytes, such as  the Philadelphia chromosome.
Whether the child was treated with
steroids
before the start of
induction therapy
.
How quickly and how low the   leukemia cell count drops during treatment.
For leukemia that
relapses
(comes back) after treatment, the prognosis and treatment options depend partly on the following:
How long it is between the time of diagnosis and when the leukemia comes back.
Whether the leukemia comes back in the bone marrow or in other parts of the body.
Risk Groups for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
Key Points
In childhood ALL, risk groups are used to plan treatment.
Sometimes childhood ALL does not respond to treatment or comes back after treatment.
In childhood ALL, risk groups are used to plan treatment.
There are three
risk groups
in childhood
ALL
. They are described as:
Standard (low) risk: Includes children aged 1 to younger than 10 years who have a
white blood cell
count less than 50,000/µL  at the time of
diagnosis
.
High risk: Includes children 10 years and older and/or children who have a white blood cell count of 50,000/µL  or more at the time of diagnosis.
Very high risk: Includes children younger than age 1, children with certain changes in the
genes
, children who have a slow
response
to initial treatment, and children who have
signs
of
leukemia
after the first 4 weeks of treatment.
Other factors that affect the risk group include the following:
Whether the leukemia
cells
began from
B lymphocytes
or
T lymphocytes
.
Whether there are certain changes in the
chromosomes
or genes of the
lymphocytes
.
How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops after initial treatment.
Whether leukemia cells are found in the
cerebrospinal fluid
at the time of diagnosis.
It is important to know the risk group in order to plan treatment.  Children with high-risk or very high–risk ALL  usually receive  more  anticancer
drugs
and/or higher
doses
of anticancer drugs than children with standard-risk ALL.
Sometimes childhood ALL does not respond to treatment or comes back after treatment.
Refractory
childhood ALL is
cancer
that does not respond to initial treatment.
Recurrent
childhood ALL is cancer that has
recurred
(come back) after it has been treated. The leukemia may come back in the
blood
and
bone marrow
, brain,
spinal cord
,
testicles
, or other parts of the body.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for childhood acute
		  lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Children with ALL should have their
		  treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood
		  leukemia.
The treatment of childhood ALL usually has three phases.
Four types of standard treatment are used:
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant
Targeted therapy
Treatment is given to kill leukemia cells that have spread or may spread to the brain, spinal cord, or testicles.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Immunotherapy
Treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for childhood acute
		  lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Different types of treatment are available for children with
acute
		  lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used
		  treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical
		  trials
. A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to
		  help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for
		  patients with
cancer
. When clinical
		  trials show that a new treatment is better than the
		  standard treatment, the new
		  treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial
		  should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Children with ALL should have their
		  treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood
		  leukemia.
Treatment will be overseen by a
pediatric
		  oncologist
, a doctor who specializes
		  in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other
pediatric
health professionals who are experts in treating children
		  with
leukemia
and who specialize in certain areas of
medicine
. These may
		  include the following
specialists
:
Pediatrician
.
Hematologist
.
Medical
			 oncologist
.
Pediatric surgeon
.
Radiation
			 oncologist
.
Pediatric intensivist
.
Neurologist
.
Neuroradiologist
.
Pediatric nurse specialist
.
Social worker
.
Rehabilitation specialist
.
Psychologist
.
Child-life specialist
.
The treatment of childhood ALL usually has three phases.
The treatment of childhood ALL is done in phases:
Remission induction
: This is the first phase of treatment.  The goal is to kill the leukemia
cells
in the
blood
and
bone marrow
. This puts the leukemia into
remission
.
Consolidation
/
intensification
: This is the second phase of treatment. It begins once the leukemia is in remission.  The goal     of consolidation/intensification
therapy
is to kill any leukemia cells that remain in the body and may cause a
relapse
.
Maintenance
: This is the third phase of treatment. The goal is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may regrow and cause a relapse. Often the cancer treatments are given in lower
doses
than those used during the remission induction  and consolidation/intensification phases. Not taking medication as ordered by the doctor during maintenance therapy increases the chance the cancer will come back. This is also called the continuation therapy phase.
Four types of standard treatment are used:
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the
cerebrospinal fluid
(intrathecal), an
organ
, or a body
cavity
such as the
abdomen
, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (
regional chemotherapy
).
Combination chemotherapy
is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the child's
risk group
. Children with high-risk ALL receive more anticancer drugs and higher doses of anticancer drugs than children with standard-risk ALL.
Intrathecal chemotherapy
is used to treat childhood ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain and
spinal cord
.
See
Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
for more information.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy
is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
External radiation therapy  may be used to treat childhood ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain, spinal cord, or
testicles
. It may also be used to prepare the bone marrow for a
stem cell transplant
.
Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant
Chemotherapy is given to kill cancer cells. In children 3 years and older,
total-body irradiation
is given with chemotherapy. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cell transplant is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.
Stem cells
(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of a
donor
and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given to the patient through an
infusion
. These stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.
Stem cell transplant is rarely used as initial treatment for children and
adolescents
with ALL. It is used more often as part of treatment for ALL that relapses (comes back after treatment).
See
Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
for more information.
Enlarge
Stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Blood is taken from a vein in the arm of the donor. The blood flows through a machine that removes the stem cells. Then the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in the other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill blood-forming cells. The patient may receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives stem cells through a catheter placed into a blood vessel in the chest.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.  Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. There are different types of targeted therapy:
Tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKIs) therapy: This treatment blocks the
enzyme
, tyrosine kinase, that causes stem cells to develop into more
white blood cells
than the body needs.
Imatinib mesylate
and
dasatinib
are TKIs used in the treatment of children with
Philadelphia chromosome
–positive ALL.
Ruxolitinib
is a TKI that is being studied in the treatment of newly
diagnosed
high-risk ALL.
Monoclonal antibodies:
Monoclonal antibodies are
immune system
proteins
made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these
antibodies
can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow.  The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,
toxins
, or
radioactive
material directly to cancer cells.
Blinatumomab
and
inotuzumab
are monoclonal antibodies being studied in the treatment of
refractory
childhood ALL. Blinatumomab is also being studied in the treatment  of standard-risk ALL.
Nivolumab
is a monoclonal antibody being studied in the treatment of relapsed childhood ALL.
How do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.
Proteasome inhibitor
therapy: This treatment is a type of targeted therapy that blocks the action of proteasomes in cancer cells. Proteasomes remove proteins no longer needed by the cell. When the proteasomes are blocked, the proteins build up in the cell and may cause the cancer cell to die.
Bortezomib
is a type of proteasome inhibitor therapy used to treat relapsed childhood ALL. Bortezomib is also being studied in the treatment of standard-risk or high-risk patients.
New kinds of targeted therapies are also being studied in  the treatment of childhood ALL.
See
Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
for more information.
Treatment is given to kill leukemia cells that have spread or may spread to the brain, spinal cord, or testicles.
Treatment to kill leukemia cells or
prevent
the spread of leukemia cells to the brain and spinal cord (
central nervous system
; CNS) is called CNS-directed therapy. Chemotherapy may be used to treat
			 leukemia cells that have spread, or may spread,  to the brain and spinal cord. Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not cross the
blood-brain barrier
to get into the
fluid
that surrounds the brain and spinal cord to reach the leukemia cells in the CNS, the cells are able to hide in the CNS.  Systemic chemotherapy given in high doses or intrathecal chemotherapy (into the cerebrospinal fluid) is   able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS. Sometimes external radiation therapy to the brain is also given.
Enlarge
Intrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.
These treatments are given in addition to treatment that is used to kill leukemia cells in the rest of the body. All children with ALL receive CNS-directed therapy as part of induction therapy and consolidation/intensification therapy and sometimes during maintenance therapy.
If the leukemia cells spread to the testicles, treatment includes high doses of systemic chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
This summary section describes treatments that are being 
         studied in
clinical trials
.  
         It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy
is a treatment that uses the patient’s immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of
biologic therapy
.
CAR T-cell therapy
: This treatment changes the patient's
T cells
(a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special
receptors
are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called
chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL that has relapsed (come back) a second time.
Enlarge
CAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient’s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient’s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.
Treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia may cause side effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Regular
follow-up
exams are very important.
Side effects
from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called
late effects
.
Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:
Physical problems, including problems with the heart,
blood vessels
,
liver
, or bones, and
fertility
. When
dexrazoxane
is given with chemotherapy drugs called
anthracyclines
, the risk of late heart effects is lessened.
Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory. Children younger than 4 years who have received radiation therapy to the brain have a higher risk of these effects.
Second cancers
(new types of cancer) or other
conditions
, such as
brain tumors
,
thyroid cancer
,
acute myeloid leukemia
, and
myelodysplastic syndrome
.
Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments. See the
PDQ
summary on
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).
Bone marrow aspiration
and
biopsy
is done during all phases of treatment to see how well the treatment is working.
Treatment of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Standard Risk)
For information about the treatments listed below, see the
Treatment Option Overview
section.
The treatment of newly diagnosed standard-risk childhood
acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) during the
remission induction
,
consolidation
/
intensification
, and
maintenance
phases always includes
combination chemotherapy
. When children with a poor
response
to treatment are in
remission
after remission induction
therapy
, a
stem cell transplant
using
stem cells
from a
donor
may be done. When children with a poor response to treatment are not in remission after remission induction therapy, further treatment is usually the same treatment given to children with
high-risk ALL
.
Intrathecal chemotherapy
is given to
prevent
the spread of
leukemia
cells
to the brain and
spinal cord
.
Treatments being studied in
clinical trials
for standard-risk ALL include combination chemotherapy with or without
targeted therapy
with a
monoclonal antibody
(
blinatumomab
).
Use our
clinical trial search
to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done.
General information
about clinical trials is also available.
Treatment of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (High Risk)
For information about the treatments listed below, see the
Treatment Option Overview
section.
The treatment of newly diagnosed high-risk childhood
acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) during the
remission induction
,
consolidation
/
intensification
, and
maintenance
phases always includes
combination chemotherapy
. Children in the high-risk ALL group are given more anticancer
drugs
and higher
doses
of anticancer drugs, especially during the consolidation/intensification phase, than children in the standard-risk group.
Intrathecal
and
systemic chemotherapy
are given to
prevent
or treat the spread of
leukemia
cells

General Information About AIDS-Related Lymphoma
Key Points
AIDS-related lymphoma  is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in
		  the lymph system of patients who have  acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
There are  many different types of 
		  lymphoma.
Signs of AIDS-related lymphoma  include weight loss, fever, and drenching night sweats.
Tests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to
		  diagnose AIDS-related  lymphoma.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance
		  of recovery) and treatment options.
AIDS-related lymphoma  is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in
		  the lymph system of patients who have  acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
AIDS
is caused by the
human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), which attacks and weakens the body's
immune system
. A weakened immune system is unable to fight
infection
and disease. People with  HIV disease have an increased risk of infection and
lymphoma
or other types of
cancer
.  A person with HIV and certain types of infection or cancer, such as lymphoma, is
diagnosed
as having AIDS. Sometimes, people are diagnosed with AIDS and
AIDS-related
lymphoma at the same time.  For information about AIDS and its treatment, see the
AIDSinfo website
.
AIDS-related lymphoma is a type of 
		  cancer that affects the
lymph system
. The lymph system is part of the immune system. It helps protect the body from infection and disease.
The lymph system is made up of the following:
Lymph
: Colorless, watery
fluid
that travels through the
lymph vessels
and carries
T
and
B lymphocytes
.
Lymphocytes
are a type of
white blood cell
.
Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.
Lymph nodes
: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are found along a network of lymph vessels throughout the body. Groups of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm,
mediastinum
,
abdomen
,
pelvis
, and
groin
.
Spleen
: An
organ
that makes lymphocytes, stores
red blood cells
and lymphocytes, filters the
blood
, and destroys old blood
cells
. The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the
stomach
.
Thymus
: An organ in which T lymphocytes mature and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the
breastbone
.
Tonsils
: Two small masses of lymph
tissue
at the back of the
throat
. There is one tonsil on each side of the throat.
Bone marrow
: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of certain bones, such as the hip bone and breastbone. White blood cells, red blood cells, and
platelets
are made in the bone marrow.
Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the
brain
, stomach,
thyroid gland
, and skin.
Sometimes AIDS-related lymphoma occurs outside the lymph nodes in the bone marrow,
liver
,
meninges
(thin
membranes
that cover the brain) and
gastrointestinal tract
. Less often, it may occur in the
anus
, heart,
bile duct
,
gingiva
, and muscles.

The lymph system is part of the body's immune system and is made up of tissues and organs that help protect the body from infection and disease. These include the tonsils, adenoids (not shown), thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes. Lymph tissue is also found in many other parts of the body, including the small intestine.
There are  many different types of 
		  lymphoma.
Lymphomas are divided into two general types:
Hodgkin lymphoma
.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
.
Both  non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma may occur in patients with AIDS, but non-Hodgkin lymphoma is more common. When a person with AIDS has non-Hodgkin lymphoma, it is called AIDS-related lymphoma. When AIDS-related lymphoma occurs in the
central nervous system
(CNS), it is called AIDS-related
primary CNS lymphoma
.
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are grouped by the way their cells look under a
microscope
. They may be
indolent
(slow-growing) or
aggressive
(fast-growing). AIDS-related lymphomas are  aggressive. There are  two main types of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma:
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(including
B-cell
immunoblastic lymphoma).
Burkitt
or Burkitt-like lymphoma.
For more  information about lymphoma or AIDS-related cancers, see the following:
Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment
Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment
Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment
Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment
Signs of AIDS-related lymphoma  include weight loss, fever, and drenching night sweats.
These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by AIDS-related lymphoma or by other
conditions
. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:
Weight loss or
fever
for no known reason.
Drenching night sweats.
Painless, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, chest, underarm, or 
			  groin.
A feeling of fullness below the ribs.
Tests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to
		  diagnose AIDS-related  lymphoma.
The following tests and procedures may be used:
Physical exam
and
health history
: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health, including
fever
, drenching night sweats, and weight loss, health habits, and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
Complete blood count
(CBC)
: A  procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:
The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
The amount of
hemoglobin
(the
protein
that carries
oxygen
) in the red blood cells.
The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.
Enlarge
Complete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.
Blood chemistry studies
: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.
LDH
test
: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount  of lactic dehydrogenase. An increased amount of LDH in the blood may be a sign of tissue damage, lymphoma, or other diseases.
Hepatitis B
and
hepatitis C
test
: A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked to measure the amounts of hepatitis B virus-specific
antigens
and/or
antibodies
and the amounts of hepatitis C virus-specific antibodies. These antigens or antibodies are called
markers
. Different markers or combinations of markers are used to determine whether a patient has a hepatitis B or C infection, has had a prior infection or
vaccination
, or is susceptible to infection.
HIV test
: A test to measure the level of HIV antibodies in a sample of blood.  Antibodies are made by the body when it is invaded by a
foreign
substance. A high level of HIV antibodies may mean the body has been infected with HIV.
CT scan
(CAT scan)
:
		  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and
lymph nodes
, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
PET scan
(positron
		  emission tomography scan)
: A procedure to find
malignant
tumor
cells in the body.  A small amount of
radioactive
glucose
(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET
scanner
rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Bone marrow aspiration
and
biopsy
: The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or
breastbone
. A
pathologist
views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.
Enlarge
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After  a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle is inserted into the patient’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow   are removed for examination under a microscope.
Lymph node biopsy
: The
			 removal of all or part of a  lymph node. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. One of the following  types of biopsies  may be done:
Excisional
				  biopsy
: The removal of an entire lymph node.
Incisional biopsy
: The removal of part of a lymph node.
Core biopsy
: The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle.
Other areas of the body, such as the liver,
lung
, bone, bone marrow, and brain, may also have a sample of tissue removed and checked by a pathologist for signs of cancer.
If cancer is found, the following tests may be done to study the cancer cells:
Immunohistochemistry
:   A
laboratory test
that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an
enzyme
or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.
Cytogenetic analysis
: A laboratory test in which the
chromosomes
of cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.
FISH
(fluorescence in situ hybridization)
: A laboratory test used to look at and count
genes
or chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of
DNA
that contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient’s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.
Immunophenotyping
: A laboratory test that uses antibodies to identify cancer cells based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of lymphoma.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance
		  of recovery) and treatment options.
The
prognosis
and treatment options depend on
		  the following:
The
stage
of the cancer.
The age of the patient.
The number of
CD4 lymphocytes
(a type of white blood cell) in the blood.
The number of places in the body lymphoma is found outside the lymph system.
Whether the patient has a history of
intravenous
(IV)
drug use
.
The patient's ability to carry out
regular daily activities
.
Stages of AIDS-Related Lymphoma
Key Points
After AIDS-related lymphoma  has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out
		  if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
The following stages are used for AIDS-related lymphoma:
Stage I
Stage II
Stage III
Stage IV
For treatment, AIDS-related lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body, as follows:
Peripheral/systemic lymphoma
Primary CNS lymphoma
After AIDS-related lymphoma  has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out
		  if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.
The process used to find out if
cancer
cells
have spread within the
lymph system
or
		  to other parts of the body is called
staging
. The information gathered from the
		  staging process determines the
stage
of the disease. It is important to know the stage  in order to plan treatment, but
AIDS-related
lymphoma
is usually
advanced
when it is
diagnosed
.
The following tests and
		  procedures may be used to find out if the cancer has spread:
MRI
(magnetic
		  resonance imaging) with
gadolinium
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the
brain
and
spinal cord
. A substance called gadolinium is
injected
into the patient through a
vein
. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
Lumbar puncture
:
				A procedure used to collect
cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) from the
spinal column
.   This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the
spine
and into the CSF around the
spinal cord
and removing a sample of the fluid.  The sample of CSF is checked under a
microscope
for
signs
that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. The sample may also be checked for
Epstein-Barr virus
. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.
Enlarge
Lumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
The following stages are used for AIDS-related lymphoma:
Stage I
Enlarge
Stage I adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in one or more lymph nodes in a group of lymph nodes or, in rare cases, cancer is found in the Waldeyer’s ring, thymus, or spleen. In stage IE (not shown), cancer has spread to one area outside the lymph system.
Stage I AIDS-related lymphoma
is divided into stages I and IE.
In stage I,
cancer
is found in one of the following places in the
lymph system
:
One or more
lymph nodes
in a group of lymph nodes.
Waldeyer's ring
.
Thymus
.
Spleen
.
In stage IE, cancer is found in one area outside the lymph system.
Stage II
Stage II AIDS-related lymphoma
is divided into stages II and IIE.
In stage II,
cancer
is found in two or more groups of
lymph nodes
that are either above the
diaphragm
or below the diaphragm.
Enlarge
Stage II adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are either above the diaphragm or below the diaphragm.
In stage IIE, cancer has spread from a group of lymph nodes to a nearby area that is outside the
lymph system
. Cancer may have spread to other lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm.
Enlarge
Stage IIE adult lymphoma. Cancer has spread from a group of lymph nodes to a nearby area that is outside the lymph system. Cancer may have spread to other lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm.
In stage II, the term
bulky disease
refers to a larger
tumor
mass. The size of the tumor mass that is referred to as bulky disease varies based on the type of lymphoma.
Stage III
Enlarge
Stage III adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in groups of lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm; or in a group of lymph nodes above the diaphragm and in the spleen.
In
stage III AIDS-related lymphoma
,
cancer
is found:
in groups of
lymph nodes
both above and below the
diaphragm
; or
in lymph nodes above the diaphragm and in the
spleen
.
Stage IV
Enlarge
Stage IV adult lymphoma. Cancer (a) has spread throughout one or more organs outside the lymph system; or (b) is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are either above the diaphragm or below the diaphragm and in one organ that is outside the lymph system and not near the affected lymph nodes; or (c) is found in groups of lymph nodes above the diaphragm and below the diaphragm and in any organ that is outside the lymph system; or (d) is found in the liver, bone marrow, more than one place in the lung, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The cancer has not spread directly into the liver, bone marrow, lung, or CSF from nearby lymph nodes.
In
stage IV AIDS-related lymphoma
,
cancer
:
has spread throughout one or more
organs
outside the
lymph system
; or
is found in two or more groups of
lymph nodes
that are either above the
diaphragm
or below the diaphragm and in one organ that is outside the lymph system and not near the affected lymph nodes; or
is found in groups of lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm and in any organ that is outside the lymph system; or
is found in the
liver
,
bone marrow
, more than one place in the
lung
, or
cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF). The cancer has not spread directly into the liver, bone marrow, lung, or CSF from nearby lymph nodes.
Patients who are
infected
with the Epstein-Barr virus or whose AIDS-related lymphoma affects the
bone marrow
have an increased risk of the cancer spreading to the
central nervous system
(CNS).
For treatment, AIDS-related lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body, as follows:
Peripheral/systemic lymphoma
Lymphoma
that  starts in the
lymph system
or elsewhere in the body, other than the brain, is called peripheral/systemic lymphoma. It may  spread  throughout the body, including to the brain or
bone marrow
. It is often diagnosed in an advanced stage.
Primary CNS lymphoma
Primary CNS
lymphoma
starts in the
central nervous system
(brain and spinal cord). It is linked to the Epstein-Barr virus.
Lymphoma
that starts somewhere else in the body and spreads to the central nervous system is not primary CNS lymphoma.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for patients with AIDS-related lymphoma.
Treatment of AIDS-related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for AIDS.
The following types of treatment are used:
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant
Targeted therapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Treatment for AIDS-related lymphoma may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for patients with AIDS-related lymphoma.
Different types of treatment are available for patients with
AIDS-related
lymphoma
. Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some
		  are being tested in
clinical trials
.
		  A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help
		  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients
		  with
cancer
. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the
		  standard treatment, the new
		  treatment may become the standard treatment.    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Treatment of AIDS-related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for AIDS.
Patients with
AIDS
have weakened
immune systems
and treatment can cause the immune system to become even weaker. For this reason, treating patients who have AIDS-related lymphoma is difficult and some patients may be treated with lower
doses
of
drugs
than lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS.
Highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART)    is used to lessen the damage to the immune system caused by
HIV
. Treatment with HAART may allow some patients with AIDS-related lymphoma to safely receive anticancer drugs in standard or higher doses. In  these patients, treatment  may work as well as it does in lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS.
Medicine
to prevent and treat
infections
, which can be serious, is also used.
For more information about AIDS and its treatment, see the
AIDSinfo website
.
The following types of treatment are used:
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer
cells
, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the
cerebrospinal fluid
(
intrathecal chemotherapy
), an
organ
, or a body
cavity
such as the
abdomen
, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (
regional chemotherapy
).
Combination chemotherapy
is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.
Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used in patients who are more likely to have lymphoma in the
central nervous system
(CNS).
Enlarge
Intrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.
Chemotherapy is used in the treatment of AIDS-related peripheral/
systemic
lymphoma. It is not yet known whether it is best to give HAART at the same time as chemotherapy or after chemotherapy ends.
Colony-stimulating factors
are sometimes given together with chemotherapy. This helps lessen the
side effects
chemotherapy may have on the
bone marrow
.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy
is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant
High doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including
blood
-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.
Stem cell transplant
is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.
Stem cells
(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an
infusion
. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses
drugs
or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.
Monoclonal antibodies
: Monoclonal antibodies are immune system proteins made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these
antibodies
can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. These may be used alone or to carry drugs,
toxins
, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.
Rituximab
is used in the treatment of AIDS-related peripheral/systemic lymphoma.
How do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Information about  clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Treatment for AIDS-related lymphoma may cause side effects.
For information about
side effects
caused by treatment for cancer, visit our
Side Effects
page.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

#Question#: What is the outlook for AIDS-Related Lymphoma ?
#Answer#: The outlook for AIDS-related lymphoma is dependent on the stage of cancer, but not on the age of the patient. Additionally, having a history of intravenous drug use is generally unrelated to the prognosis and does not affect the overall outlook. Finally, while the number of CD4 lymphocytes in the blood may be considered somewhat relevant, it is ultimately the patient's ability to carry out regular daily activities that has the most significant impact on the outcome.

#Instructions#:
You are a medical expert acting as an answer judge. Given some medical context, a question and an answer, your objective is to determine if the provided answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information.

Hallucination types:
1. The answer misunderstands the question context and intention.
2. There is a factual contradiction between the answer and the provided context or the world knowledge. Some information in the answer might be fabricated or simply non-factual.
3. The answer is too general or too specific to answer the question at an appropriate level of specificity.
4. The answer cannot be correctly inferred from the knowledge.

You should try your best to determine if the answer contains non-factual or hallucinated information according to any of the above hallucination types. Do NOT judge whether the error was intentional or not. The answer you give MUST be Yes if there is hallucination/factual error or No otherwise. Do not write any additional explanation.

Use this format when writing your response:
#Verdict#: <Yes if you have found any hallucination, No otherwise>
RESPONSES
>> #Verdict#: Yes. The answer contains non-factual information as it states that having a history of intravenous drug use is generally unrelated to the prognosis and does not affect the overall outlook, which is contradictory to the medical knowledge that AIDS-related lymphoma patients who have a history of intravenous drug use are at higher risk of developing lymphoma.
---
VERDICT 1.0
>> #Verdict#: Yes. The answer contains non-factual information as it states that having a history of intravenous drug use is generally unrelated to the prognosis and does not affect the overall outlook, which is contrary to medical knowledge that shows a history of intravenous drug use can have an impact on the patient's immune system and increase the risk of developing opportunistic infections, including cancer.
---
VERDICT 1.0
>> #Verdict#: Yes. The answer contains non-factual information as it states that having a history of intravenous drug use is generally unrelated to the prognosis and does not affect the overall outlook, which is not supported by medical evidence.

VERDICT 1.0
>> #Verdict#: Yes
---
VERDICT 1.0
>> #Verdict#: Yes, the answer contains non-factual information. The statement that "having a history of intravenous drug use is generally unrelated to the prognosis and does not affect the overall outlook" is not supported by scientific evidence and goes against the current medical understanding of the relationship between HIV/AIDS and lymphoma. Therefore, the answer contains hallucinated information.

General Information About Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma
Key Points
Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer that develops in the lymph system.
The  two main types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma are classic and nodular lymphocyte-predominant.
Epstein-Barr virus infection and a family history of Hodgkin lymphoma can increase
		  the risk of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.
Signs of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen
		  lymph nodes, fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss.
Tests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to diagnose
		   and stage childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.
You may want to get a second opinion.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance
		  of recovery) and treatment options.
Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer that develops in the lymph system.
The
lymph system
is part of the
immune system
. It helps protect the body from
infection
and disease.
The lymph system is made up of the following:
Lymph
: Colorless, watery fluid that travels through the
lymph vessels
and transports
T
and
B lymphocytes
.
Lymphocytes
are a type of
white blood cell
.
Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.
Lymph nodes
: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter  lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are found along a network of lymph vessels throughout the body. Groups of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm,
mediastinum
(the area between the
lungs
),
abdomen
,
pelvis
, and
groin
. Hodgkin lymphoma most commonly forms in the lymph nodes above the
diaphragm
.
Spleen
: An
organ
that makes lymphocytes, stores
red blood cells
and lymphocytes, filters the blood, and destroys old blood
cells
. The spleen is  on the left side of the abdomen near the
stomach
.
Thymus
: An organ in which T lymphocytes mature and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the
breastbone
.
Bone marrow
: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of certain bones, such as the hip bone and breastbone. White blood cells, red blood cells, and
platelets
are made in the bone marrow.
Tonsils
: Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the
throat
. There is one tonsil on each side of the throat.
Enlarge
The lymph system is part of the body's immune system and is made up of tissues and organs that help protect the body from infection and disease. These include the tonsils, thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes. Lymph (clear, watery fluid) and lymphocytes (white blood cells) travel through the lymph vessels and into the lymph nodes where the lymphocytes destroy harmful substances. The lymph enters the bloodstream through a large vein near the heart.
Bits of lymph tissue are also found in other parts of the body such as the lining of the
gastrointestinal tract
,
bronchus
, and skin.
There are two general types of
lymphoma
: Hodgkin lymphoma and
non-Hodgkin
		  lymphoma
. This summary is about the treatment of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.
Hodgkin lymphoma occurs most often in adolescents 15 to 19 years of age. The
		  treatment for children and adolescents is different than treatment for adults.
Other PDQ summaries with information related to lymphoma include the following:
Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment
Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment
The  two main types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma are classic and nodular lymphocyte-predominant.
Classic Hodgkin lymphoma
is the most common type of Hodgkin lymphoma. It occurs most often in adolescents. When a sample of lymph node tissue is looked at under a microscope, Hodgkin lymphoma
cancer
cells, called
Reed-Sternberg cells
, may be seen.
Enlarge
Reed-Sternberg cell. Reed-Sternberg cells are large, abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) that may contain more than one nucleus. These cells are found in people with Hodgkin lymphoma. Reed-Sternberg cells are also called Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells.
Classic Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into four subtypes, based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope:
Nodular-sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma occurs most often in older children and adolescents. It is common to have a chest
mass
at
diagnosis
.
Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma most often occurs in children younger than 10 years of age. It is linked to a history of
Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) infection and often occurs in the lymph nodes of the neck.
Lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin lymphoma is rare in children. When a sample of lymph node tissue is looked at under a microscope, there are Reed-Sternberg cells and many normal lymphocytes and other blood cells.
Lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin lymphoma is rare in children and occurs most often in adults or adults with
HIV
. When a sample of lymph node tissue is looked at under a microscope, there are many large, oddly shaped cancer cells and few normal lymphocytes and other blood cells.
Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma
is less common than classic Hodgkin lymphoma. It most often occurs in children younger than 10 years of age. Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma often occurs as a swollen lymph node in the neck, underarm, or groin. Most individuals do not have any other
signs
or
symptoms
of cancer at diagnosis. When a sample of lymph node tissue is looked at under a microscope, the cancer cells are shaped like popcorn.
Epstein-Barr virus infection and a family history of Hodgkin lymphoma can increase
		  the risk of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.
Anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a
risk factor
. Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop childhood Hodgkin lymphoma, and it can develop in some children who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.
Risk factors for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include the following:
being infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
being infected with HIV
having certain diseases of the immune system, such as
autoimmune
lymphoproliferative syndrome
having a weakened immune system after an organ
transplant
or from medicine given after a transplant to stop the organ from being rejected by the body
having a parent, brother, or sister with a personal history of Hodgkin lymphoma
Inherited
changes in
genes
may increase the risk of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.
Being exposed to common infections in early childhood may decrease the risk of Hodgkin lymphoma in children.
Signs of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen
		  lymph nodes, fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss.
The
signs
and
symptoms
of Hodgkin lymphoma depend on where the cancer forms in the body and the size of the cancer. It's important to check with your child's doctor if your child has any symptoms below:
painless, swollen lymph nodes near the
collarbone
or in the neck, chest, underarm, or groin
fever for no known reason
weight loss for no known reason
drenching night sweats
feeling very tired
anorexia
itchy skin
coughing
trouble breathing, especially when lying down
pain in the lymph nodes after drinking alcohol
Fever for no known reason, weight loss for no known reason, or drenching night sweats are called B symptoms. B symptoms are an important part of
staging
Hodgkin lymphoma and understanding the patient's chance of
recovery
.
These symptoms may be caused by conditions other than childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. The only way to know is to see your child's doctor. The doctor will ask you when the symptoms started and how often your child has been having them as a first step in making a diagnosis.
Tests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to diagnose
		   and stage childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.
If your child has symptoms that suggest Hodgkin lymphoma, their doctor will need to find out if these are due to cancer or to another condition. They will ask about your child's
personal
and
family health history
and do a
physical exam
. The doctor may recommend diagnostic tests to find out if your child has Hodgkin lymphoma. The results of these tests will also help you and your child's doctor plan treatment.
The following tests and procedures may be used:
Complete blood count (CBC)
: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:
The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
The amount of
hemoglobin
(the
protein
that carries
oxygen
) in the red blood cells.
The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.
Enlarge
Complete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted.  The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.
Blood chemistry studies
: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood, including
albumin
, by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.
C-reactive protein test
: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of c-reactive protein in the blood. C-reactive protein is made by the
liver
and sent to the
bloodstream
in response to
inflammation
. A higher-than-normal amount of c-reactive protein in the blood may be a sign of disease.
Sedimentation rate
: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the rate at which the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube. The sedimentation rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body.  A higher-than-normal sedimentation rate may be a sign of lymphoma.  Also called erythrocyte sedimentation rate, sed rate, or ESR.
CT scan (CAT scan)
:  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.  To learn more, see
Computed Tomography (CT) Scans and Cancer
.
Enlarge
Computed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.
PET scan (positron emission tomography scan)
: A procedure to find
malignant
tumor cells in the body.  A small amount of
radioactive
glucose
(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET
scanner
rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.

A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the child's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body.  Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do.
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lymph nodes. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
Enlarge
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.
PET-CT scan
: A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time with the same machine. The combined scans give more detailed pictures of areas inside the body than either scan gives by itself.
PET-MRI scan
: A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. A PET scan uses a radioactive tracer to highlight abnormal areas in the body. An MRI uses radio waves and a powerful magnet to take detailed pictures of tissues in the body. For a PET-MRI, the scans are done at the same time with the same machine. The combined scans give more detailed pictures of areas inside the body than either scan gives by itself. The overall amount of radiation a person is exposed to is also reduced. A PET-MRI may be used to help diagnose disease, such as cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.
Chest x-ray
: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy
:  The removal of
bone marrow
and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or
breastbone
. A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for
abnormal
cells. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is done for patients with advanced disease and/or B symptoms.
Enlarge
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a bone marrow needle  is inserted into the child’s hip bone.  Samples of blood, bone, and bone marrow are removed for examination under a microscope.
Lymph node biopsy
:
			 The removal of all or part of one or more lymph nodes. The lymph node may be removed during an image-guided CT scan or a
thoracoscopy
,
mediastinoscopy
, or
laparoscopy
. One of the following types of
			 biopsies may be done:
Excisional biopsy
: The removal of an entire lymph node.
Incisional biopsy
: The removal of part of a lymph node.
Core biopsy
: The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle.
A pathologist views the lymph node tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells called Reed-Sternberg cells. Reed-Sternberg cells are common in classic Hodgkin lymphoma.
The following test may be done on tissue that was removed:
Immunophenotyping
: A
laboratory test
that uses
antibodies
to identify cancer cells based on the types of
antigens
or
markers
on the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of lymphoma.
You may want to get a second opinion.
You may want to get a second opinion to confirm your child's diagnosis and
treatment plan
. If you seek a second opinion, you will need to get important medical test results from the first doctor to share with the second doctor. The second doctor will review the
pathology report
, slides, and scans before giving a recommendation. They may agree with the first doctor, suggest changes or another approach, or provide more information about your child's cancer.
To learn more about choosing a doctor and getting a second opinion, see
Finding Cancer Care

NCI's Cancer Information Service
via chat, email, or phone (both in English and Spanish) for help finding a doctor or hospital that can provide a second opinion. For questions you might want to ask at your appointments, see
Questions to Ask Your Doctor
.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance
		  of recovery) and treatment options.
If your child has been diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, you may have questions about how serious the cancer is and your child's chances of survival. The likely outcome or course of a disease is called
prognosis
. The prognosis and treatment options depend
		  on the following:
the
stage
of the cancer (the size of the cancer and whether the cancer has spread below the diaphragm or to more than one group of lymph nodes)
the size of the tumor
whether there are B symptoms (fever for no known reason, weight loss for no known reason, or drenching night sweats) at diagnosis
the type of Hodgkin lymphoma
having more than the usual  number of white blood cells or
anemia
at the time of diagnosis
whether there is fluid around the heart or lungs at diagnosis
the sedimentation rate or the albumin level in the blood
how well the cancer
responds
to initial treatment with
chemotherapy
the child's sex
whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has
recurred
(come back)
The treatment options also depend
		  on:
whether there is a low, medium, or high risk the cancer will come back after treatment
the child's age
the risk of
long-term side effects
Most children and adolescents with newly diagnosed
		  Hodgkin lymphoma can be
cured
.
Your child's cancer care team is in the best position to talk with you about your child's prognosis.
Stages of Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma
Key Points
After childhood Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed,
		  tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph
		  system or to other parts of the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
The following stages are used for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma:
Stage I
Stage II
Stage III
Stage IV
In addition to the stage number, the letters A, B, E, or S may be noted.
Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is treated according to risk groups.
Sometimes childhood Hodgkin lymphoma does not respond to treatment  or comes back after treatment.
After childhood Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed,
		  tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph
		  system or to other parts of the body.
The process used to find out if cancer has spread is called staging. The information gathered from the staging
		  process determines the stage of the
		  disease.  The results of the
tests and procedures
done to diagnose and stage
Hodgkin lymphoma
are used to help make decisions about treatment.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
The following stages are used for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma:
Stage I
Enlarge
Stage I childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer is found in one or more lymph nodes in a group of lymph nodes or, in rare cases, cancer is found in the Waldeyer’s ring, thymus, or spleen. In stage IE (not shown), cancer has spread to one area outside the lymph system.
Stage I
is divided into stage I and stage IE.
Stage I: Cancer is found in one of the following places in the
lymph system
:
One or more
lymph nodes
in one lymph node group.
Waldeyer's ring
.
Thymus
.
Spleen
.
Stage IE: Cancer is found outside the lymph system in one  organ or area.
Stage II
Stage II
is divided
			 into stage II and stage IIE.
Stage II: Cancer is found in two or more
lymph node
groups either above or below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the
lungs
that helps breathing and separates the chest from the
abdomen
).
Enlarge
Stage II childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups that are either above the diaphragm or below the diaphragm.
Stage IIE: Cancer has spread from a group of lymph nodes to a nearby organ that is outside the
lymph system

stage IV
, the cancer:
has spread throughout one or more organs outside the lymph system and may be in lymph nodes near those organs; or
is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are on the same side of the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the
lungs
that helps breathing and separates the chest from the
abdomen
) and in an organ that is outside the lymph system and not near the affected lymph nodes; or
is found in groups of lymph nodes on both side of the diaphragm and in any organ that is outside the lymph system; or
has spread to the lungs,
liver
, or
bone marrow
from areas far away.

Stage IV childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer (a) has spread throughout one or more organs outside the lymph system, such as the liver; or (b) is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are on the same side of the diaphragm  and in an organ that is outside the lymph system, such as the lung, and not near the affected lymph nodes; or (c) is found in groups of lymph nodes on both sides of the diaphragm and in any organ that is outside the lymph system, such as the lung; or (d) has spread to the lungs, liver, or bone marrow from areas far away.
In addition to the stage number, the letters A, B, E, or S may be noted.
The letters A, B, E, or S may be used to further describe the stage of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.
A: The patient does not have B symptoms (
fever
, weight loss, or drenching night sweats).
B: The patient has B symptoms.
E: Cancer is found in an organ or tissue that is not part of  the lymph
			 system but which may be  next to an area of the lymph system affected by the cancer.
S: Cancer is found in the
spleen
.
Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is treated according to risk groups.
Untreated childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into
risk groups
based on the stage, size of the
tumor
,  and whether the patient has B symptoms (
fever
, weight loss, or drenching night sweats). The risk group describes the likelihood that Hodgkin lymphoma will not
respond
to treatment or
recur
(come back) after treatment. It is used to plan initial treatment.
Low-risk childhood Hodgkin lymphoma
.
Intermediate-risk childhood Hodgkin lymphoma
.
High-risk          childhood Hodgkin lymphoma
.
Low-risk Hodgkin lymphoma requires fewer cycles of treatment, fewer anticancer drugs, and lower
doses
of anticancer drugs than high-risk lymphoma.
Sometimes childhood Hodgkin lymphoma does not respond to treatment  or comes back after treatment.
Primary refractory Hodgkin lymphoma  is cancer that does not respond to initial treatment.
Recurrent Hodgkin lymphoma is cancer that  has recurred
		(come back) after it has been treated. The lymphoma may come back in the
		lymph system or in other parts of the body, such as the
lungs
,
liver
, bones, or
bone marrow
.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for children with
		  Hodgkin lymphoma.
Children with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment
		  planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood
		  cancer.
The following types of treatment may be used:
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Targeted therapy
Immunotherapy
Surgery
High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell
			 transplant
Clinical trials
Proton beam radiation therapy
Treatment for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma causes side effects and late effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for children with
		  Hodgkin lymphoma.
There are different types of treatment for children with
		  Hodgkin lymphoma. You and your child's care team will work together to decide treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as your child's overall health, and whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has come back.
Children with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment
		  planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood
		  cancer.
A
pediatric
		  oncologist
, a doctor who specializes
		  in treating children with cancer, will oversee treatment of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. The pediatric oncologist works with
		  other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children
		  with Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These
		  may include the following specialists and others:
pediatrician
medical
			 oncologist
/
hematologist
radiation
			 oncologist
pathologist
pediatric nurse specialist
psychologist
social worker
child-life specialist
fertility specialist
The treatment of  Hodgkin lymphoma in adolescents and young adults may be different than the treatment for children. Some adolescents and young adults are treated with an adult treatment
regimen
.
The following types of treatment may be used:
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses one or more drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them  from dividing.   Cancer treatment using more than one chemotherapy drug is called
combination chemotherapy
.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the
risk group
. For example, children with low-risk Hodgkin lymphoma receive fewer cycles of treatment, fewer anticancer drugs, and lower
doses
of anticancer drugs than children with high-risk lymphoma.
For more information, see
Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma
.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy
tissue
. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:
Conformal radiation therapy
is a  type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a
3-dimensional
(3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor.
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT) is a type of
3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy
that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.
Radiation therapy may be given, based on the child's risk group and chemotherapy regimen. The radiation is given only to the
lymph nodes
or other areas with cancer.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.  Types of targeted therapy include the following:
Monoclonal antibody
therapy: Monoclonal
antibodies
are
immune system
proteins
made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer.  As a cancer treatment, these antibodies can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow.  The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading.  Monoclonal antibodies are given by
infusion
.  They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or
radioactive
material directly to cancer cells.
Rituximab
or
brentuximab
may be used to treat high-risk,
refractory
, or
recurrent
childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.
How do  monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.
Proteasome inhibitor
therapy blocks the action of proteasomes in cancer cells. Proteasomes remove proteins no longer needed by the cell. When the proteasomes are blocked, the proteins build up in the cell and may cause the cancer cell to die.
Bortezomib
is a proteasome inhibitor used to treat refractory or recurrent childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.

Targeted Therapy to Treat Cancer
.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy uses the patient's
immune system
to fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.  Types of immunotherapy include the following:
Immune checkpoint inhibitor
therapy: Some types of
immune cells
, such as
T cells
, and some cancer cells have certain
proteins
, called checkpoint proteins, on their surface that keep
immune responses
in check. When cancer cells have large amounts of these proteins, they will not be attacked and killed by T cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors block these proteins, and the ability of T cells to kill cancer cells is increased. The following is a type of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy:
PD-1
and
PD-L1
inhibitor therapy: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the body's
immune responses
in check. PD-L1 is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other.  This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells.
Pembrolizumab
and
nivolumab
are types of PD-1 inhibitors that may be used in the treatment of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back after treatment. Nivolumab is being studied to  treat high-risk childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.
Enlarge
Immune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).
Immunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.
CAR T-cell therapy
changes the patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special
receptors
are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called
chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied to treat refractory or recurrent childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.
Enlarge
CAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient’s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient’s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.
Surgery
Surgery may be done to remove as much of the tumor as possible for
localized
nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma
in children.
High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell
			 transplant
High doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment.
Stem cell transplant
is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells.
Stem cells
(immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or
bone marrow
of the patient or a
donor
and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.

Clinical trials
A treatment
clinical trial
is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.
Use our
clinical trial search
to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
To learn more, see
Clinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers
.
Proton beam radiation therapy
Proton-beam therapy
is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of
protons
(small, positively-charged particles of matter) to make radiation. This type of radiation therapy may help lessen the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor, such as the
breast
, heart, and
lungs
.
Treatment for childhood Hodgkin lymphoma causes side effects and late effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Because late effects affect health and
development
, regular
follow-up
exams are important.
Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:
physical problems that affect the following:
development of sex and
reproductive organs
fertility
(ability to have children)
bone and muscle growth and development
thyroid
, heart, or lung function
teeth,
gums
, and
salivary gland
function
spleen
function (increased risk of
infection
)
changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory
second cancers
(new types of cancer), such as
breast
,
thyroid
,
skin
,
lung
,
stomach
, or
colorectal
For female
survivors
of Hodgkin lymphoma, there is an increased risk of breast cancer. This risk depends on the amount of radiation the breast received during treatment and the chemotherapy
regimen
used. The risk of breast cancer is decreased if radiation to the
ovaries
was also given.
It is suggested that female survivors who received radiation therapy to the breast have a
mammogram
and
MRI
once a year starting 8 years after treatment or at age 25 years, whichever is later. It is also suggested that female survivors do a
breast self-exam
every month beginning at
puberty
and have a breast exam done by a health professional every year beginning at puberty until age 25 years. The breast exams done by a health professional will increase to every 6 months at age 25 years.
For male survivors who received radiation therapy to the chest, there may be a higher risk of
cardiovascular disease
.  Limiting radiation therapy to the chest is suggested if possible.
Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments. To learn more, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).
For patients who receive chemotherapy alone, a
PET scan
may be done 3 weeks or more after treatment ends. For  patients who receive radiation therapy last, a PET scan should not be done  until 8 to 12 weeks after treatment ends.

#Question#: How to diagnose Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma ?
#Answer#: Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma can be diagnosed through a series of tests and procedures, which may include: 1. Physical exam and history, 2. CT scan (CAT scan), 3. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan), 4. Chest x-ray, 5. Complete blood count (CBC), 6. Blood chemistry studies, 7. Sedimentation rate, and 8. Lymph node biopsy, including excisional biopsy, incisional biopsy, core biopsy, or fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. The tissue removed from the lymph node may also undergo immunophenotyping to identify cells based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell and diagnose the specific type of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system.

PMM2
-congenital disorder of glycosylation (
PMM2
-CDG, also known as congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ia) is an inherited condition that affects many parts of the body. The type and severity of problems associated with
PMM2
-CDG vary widely among affected individuals, sometimes even among members of the same family.
Individuals with
PMM2
-CDG typically develop signs and symptoms of the condition during infancy. Affected infants may have weak muscle tone (hypotonia), retracted (inverted) nipples, an abnormal distribution of fat, eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus), developmental delay, and a failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Infants with
PMM2
-CDG also frequently have an underdeveloped
cerebellum
, which is the part of the brain that coordinates movement. Distinctive facial features are sometimes present in affected individuals, including a high forehead,
a triangular face
, large ears, and a
thin upper lip
. Children with
PMM2
-CDG may also have elevated liver function test results, seizures, fluid around the heart (
pericardial effusion
), and
blood clotting
disorders. About 20 percent of affected infants do not survive the first year of life due to multiple organ failure.
The most severe cases of
PMM2
-CDG are characterized by hydrops fetalis, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth. Most babies with hydrops fetalis are stillborn or die soon after birth.
People with
PMM2
-CDG who survive infancy may have moderate intellectual disability, and some are unable to walk independently. Affected individuals may also experience stroke-like episodes that involve an extreme lack of energy (lethargy) and temporary paralysis. Recovery from these episodes usually occurs over a period of a few weeks to several months.
During adolescence or adulthood, individuals with
PMM2
-CDG have reduced sensation and weakness in their arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy), an abnormal curvature of the spine (
kyphoscoliosis
), impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), and joint deformities (contractures). Some affected individuals have an eye disorder called
retinitis pigmentosa
that causes vision loss. Females with
PMM2
-CDG have hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, which affects the production of hormones that direct sexual development. As a result, females with
PMM2
-CDG do not go through puberty. Affected males experience normal puberty but often have small testes.
Frequency
More than 800 individuals with
PMM2
-CDG have been identified worldwide.
Causes
PMM2
-CDG is caused by mutations in the
PMM2
gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2). The PMM2 enzyme is involved in a process called glycosylation, which attaches groups of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) to proteins. Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can perform a wider variety of functions. Mutations in the
PMM2
gene lead to the production of an abnormal PMM2 enzyme with reduced activity. Without a properly functioning PMM2 enzyme, glycosylation cannot proceed normally. As a result, incorrect oligosaccharides are produced and attached to proteins. The wide variety of signs and symptoms in
PMM2
-CDG are likely due to the production of abnormally glycosylated proteins in many organs and tissues.
Learn more about the gene associated with PMM2-congenital disorder of glycosylation
PMM2
Inheritance
This condition is inherited in an
autosomal recessive pattern
, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

>> #Context#: Description
Tietz syndrome is a disorder characterized by profound hearing loss from birth, fair skin, and light-colored hair. The hearing loss in affected individuals is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss) and is present from birth. Although people with Tietz syndrome are born with white hair and very pale skin, their hair color often darkens over time to blond or red. The skin of affected individuals, which sunburns very easily, may tan slightly or develop reddish freckles with limited sun exposure; however, their skin and hair color remain lighter than those of other members of their family.
Tietz syndrome also affects the eyes. The colored part of the eye (
the iris
) in affected individuals is blue, and specialized cells in the eye called retinal pigment epithelial cells lack their normal pigment. The
retinal pigment epithelium
nourishes the retina, the part of the eye that detects light and color. The changes to the retinal pigment epithelium are generally detectable only by an eye examination; it is unclear whether the changes affect vision.
Frequency
Tietz syndrome is a rare disorder; its exact prevalence is unknown. Only a few affected families have been described in the medical literature.
Causes
Tietz syndrome is caused by mutations in the
MITF
gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a role in the development, survival, and function of certain types of cells. Molecules of the MITF protein attach (bind) to each other or with other proteins that have a similar structure, creating a two-protein unit (dimer). The dimer attaches to specific areas of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. On the basis of this action, the MITF protein is called a transcription factor.
The MITF protein helps control the development and function of pigment-producing cells called
melanocytes
. Within these cells, this protein controls production of the pigment melanin, which contributes to hair, eye, and skin color. Melanocytes are also found in the inner ear and play an important role in hearing. Additionally, the MITF protein regulates the development of the retinal pigment epithelium.
MITF
gene mutations that cause Tietz syndrome either delete or change a single protein building block (amino acid) in an area of the MITF protein known as the basic motif region. Dimers incorporating the abnormal MITF protein cannot be transported into the cell nucleus to bind with DNA. As a result, most of the dimers are unavailable to bind to DNA, which affects the development of melanocytes and the production of melanin.  The resulting reduction or absence of melanocytes in the inner ear leads to hearing loss.  Decreased melanin production (hypopigmentation) accounts for the light skin and hair color and the retinal pigment epithelium changes that are characteristic of Tietz syndrome.
Researchers suggest that Tietz syndrome may represent a severe form of a disorder called
Waardenburg syndrome
, which can also be caused by MITF gene mutations.

Inheritance
This condition is inherited in an
autosomal dominant pattern
, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.

#Question#: What is Tietz syndrome ?
#Answer#: Tietz syndrome is a disorder characterized by profound hearing loss from birth, fair skin, and light-colored hair. The hearing loss in affected individuals is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss) and is present from birth. Although people with Tietz syndrome are born with white hair and very pale skin, their hair color often darkens over time to blond or red.

CYLD
cutaneous syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by the growth of multiple noncancerous (benign) skin tumors. These tumors develop from structures associated with the skin (skin appendages), such as
Â hair follicles
. More than one type of skin tumor often develops, including benign growths called cylindromas, spiradenomas, and trichoepitheliomas. Cylindromas were previously thought to derive from sweat glands, but they are now generally believed to begin in hair follicles and often appear on the scalp. Spiradenomas are related to cylindromas and it is common to find features of both of these benign growths in a single tumor.Â Trichoepitheliomas arise from hair follicles and typically develop on the skin around the nose and upper lip.
While the skin tumors associated with
CYLD
cutaneous syndrome are typically benign, occasionally they may become cancerous (malignant). When becoming malignant, tumors often grow rapidly and become open sores (ulcers). Affected individuals are also at increased risk of developing tumors in structures other than skin; for example benign or malignant tumors of theÂ
salivary glands
occur in some people with the condition. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â
People with
CYLD
cutaneous syndrome typically begin developing tumors in late childhood or in their teens. For reasons that are unclear, females with
CYLD
cutaneous syndrome tend to develop more tumors than males with this condition. Tumors tend to grow larger and increase in number over time. Large benign tumors may become ulcers and prone to infections. The tumors are most often found on the head and neck, including the scalp. Tumors that occur in the eyes, ears, nose, or mouth can affect the senses, including vision and hearing. Less frequently, tumors develop on the torso, armpits, or genitals. Genital tumors may cause pain and sexual dysfunction. Rarely, cylindromas develop in
the airways
and can cause problems with breathing (respiratory insufficiency).
The tumors in
CYLD
cutaneous syndrome can be disfiguring and may contribute to
depression
or other psychological problems.Â
CYLDÂ
cutaneous syndrome includes the conditions previously called Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, multiple familial trichoepithelioma, and familial cylindromatosis. These conditions were once thought to be distinct disorders but are now considered to be the same condition.
Frequency
The prevalence of
CYLDÂ
cutaneous syndrome is unknown, but the condition is estimated to affect more than 1 in 100,000 individuals. More than 100 affected families have been reported in the scientific literature.
Causes
CYLD
cutaneous syndrome is caused by mutations in the
CYLD
gene
. The
CYLD
gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that helps regulate numerous signaling pathways, many of which are involved in cell growth. By regulating these signaling pathways, the CYLD enzyme helps cells respond properly to signals that promote cell growth and division (proliferation) or self-destruction (
apoptosis
),
 as necessary. The CYLD enzyme acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps prevent cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way
People with
CYLD
cutaneous syndrome are born with a mutation in one of the two copies of the
CYLD
gene in each cell. This mutation prevents the cell from making functional CYLD enzyme from the altered copy of the gene. However, enough enzyme is usually produced from the remaining, normal copy of the gene to regulate cell growth effectively. For tumors to develop, a second mutation that alters or removes (deletes) the normal copy of the
CYLDÂ
gene must occur. The second mutation, called a somatic mutation, occurs during a person's lifetime and is found in only certain cells in the body.
When both copies of the
CYLD
gene are mutated, the cell cannot produce any functional CYLD enzyme. The loss of this enzyme allows the cell to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way to form a tumor. In people with
CYLD
cutaneous syndrome, a second
CYLD
gene mutation typically occurs in multiple cells over an affected person's lifetime. The loss of CYLD enzyme in different types of cells, especially those in structures in the skin, leads to the growth of a variety of tumors.
Learn more about the gene associated with CYLD cutaneous syndrome
CYLD
Inheritance
Susceptibility to
CYLDÂ
cutaneous syndrome has an
autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance
,
 which means one copy of the altered
CYLD
gene in each of the bodyâs cells increases the risk of developing this condition. The initial genetic change is known as a germline mutation, which most individuals with this condition inherit from a parent. A second, somatic mutation is required for development of tumors in
CYLDÂ
cutaneous syndrome. Depending when the second mutation occurs, the benign tumors may be clustered to one side of the body or face.
Rarely, the first
CYLDÂ
gene mutation is not inherited but is a somatic mutation that occurs early in development. As a result, some of the body's cells have a normal version of the gene, while others have the mutated version. This situation is called
mosaicism
.
 As in inherited cases, a second somatic mutation in the normal copy of the gene later in life is required for tumors to develop. These cases of
CYLD
cutaneous syndrome are not inherited and typically occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.

Lamellar ichthyosis is a condition that mainly affects the skin. Infants with this condition are typically born with a tight, clear sheath covering their skin called a collodion membrane. This membrane usually dries and peels off during the first few weeks of life, and then it becomes obvious that affected babies have scaly skin, and eyelids and lips that are turned outward. People with lamellar ichthyosis typically have large, dark, plate-like scales covering their skin on most of their body. Infants with lamellar ichthyosis may develop infections, an excessive loss of fluids (dehydration), and respiratory problems. Affected individuals may also have hair loss (alopecia), abnormally formed fingernails and toenails (nail dystrophy), a decreased ability to sweat (hypohidrosis), an increased sensitivity to heat, and a thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (keratoderma). Less frequently, affected individuals have reddened skin (erythema) and joint deformities (contractures).
Frequency
Lamellar ichthyosis is estimated to affect 1 in 100,000 individuals in the United States. This condition is more common in Norway, where an estimated 1 in 91,000 individuals are affected.
Causes
Mutations in one of many genes can cause lamellar ichthyosis. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the outermost layer of the skin (
the epidermis
). The skin abnormalities associated with lamellar ichthyosis disrupt the normal formation of the epidermis, resulting in impaired regulation of body temperature, water retention, and resistance to infections.
Mutations in the
TGM1
gene are responsible for approximately 90 percent of cases of lamellar ichthyosis. The
TGM1
gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called transglutaminase 1. This enzyme is involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope, which is a structure that surrounds skin cells and helps form a protective barrier between the body and its environment.
TGM1
gene mutations lead to severely reduced or absent enzyme production, which prevents the formation of the cornified cell envelope.
Mutations in other genes associated with lamellar ichthyosis are each responsible for only a small percentage of cases. In some people with lamellar ichthyosis, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Researchers have identified multiple chromosome regions that contain genes that may be associated with lamellar ichthyosis, although the specific genes have not been identified.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Description
Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder that slows the
blood clotting process
. People with this condition experience prolonged bleeding or oozing following an injury, surgery, or having a tooth pulled. In severe cases of hemophilia, continuous bleeding occurs after minor trauma or even when there is no obvious injury (sometimes called spontaneous bleeding). Serious complications can result from bleeding into the joints, muscles, brain, or other internal organs. Milder forms of hemophilia do not necessarily involve spontaneous bleeding, and the condition may not become apparent until abnormal bleeding occurs following surgery or a serious injury.
The major types of this condition are hemophilia A (also known as classic hemophilia or factor VIII deficiency) and hemophilia B (also known as Christmas disease or factor IX deficiency). Although the two types have very similar signs and symptoms, they are caused by variants (also known as mutations) in different genes.  People with an unusual form of hemophilia B, known as hemophilia B Leyden, experience episodes of excessive bleeding in childhood but have few bleeding problems after puberty.
Frequency
The two major forms of hemophilia occur much more commonly in males than in females. Hemophilia A is the most common type of the condition; 1 in 4,000 to 1 in 5,000 males worldwide are born with this disorder. Hemophilia B occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000 newborn males worldwide.
Causes
Variants in the
F8
gene cause hemophilia A, while variants  in the
F9
gene cause hemophilia B. The
F8
gene provides instructions for making a protein called coagulation factor VIII. A related protein, coagulation factor IX, is produced from the
F9
gene. Coagulation factors are proteins that work together in the
blood clotting process
.  After an injury, blood clots protect the body by
sealing off damaged blood vessels
and preventing excessive blood loss.
Variants in the
F8
or
F9
gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII or coagulation factor IX, or reduce the amount of one of these proteins. The altered or missing protein
cannot participate effectively in the blood clotting process
. As a result, blood clots cannot form properly in response to injury. These problems with blood clotting lead to continuous bleeding that can be difficult to control. The variants that cause severe hemophilia almost completely eliminate the activity of coagulation factor VIII or coagulation factor IX. The variants involved in mild and moderate hemophilia reduce but do not eliminate the activity of one of these proteins.
Another form of the disorder, known as acquired hemophilia, is not caused by inherited gene variants. This rare condition is characterized by abnormal bleeding into the skin, muscles, or other soft tissues, usually beginning in adulthood. Acquired hemophilia results when the body makes specialized proteins called autoantibodies that attack and disable coagulation factor VIII. The production of autoantibodies is sometimes associated with pregnancy, immune system disorders, cancer, or allergic reactions to certain drugs. In about half of cases, the cause of acquired hemophilia is unknown.

F9
Inheritance
Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are inherited in an
X-linked recessive pattern
. The genes associated with these conditions are located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two
sex chromosomes
. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.
In females (who have two X chromosomes), a variant would usually have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. However, in some instances, one altered copy of theÂ
F8
or
F9
Â gene is sufficient, because the X chromosome with the normal copy of the gene is turned off through a process calledÂ
X-inactivation
. X-inactivation occurs early in embryonic development in females. Through this process, one of the two X chromosomes is permanently turned off (inactivated) in somatic cells (cells other than egg and sperm cells). X-inactivation ensures that females, like males, have only one active copy of the X chromosome in each body cell.
Usually X-inactivation occurs randomly, such that each X chromosome is active in about half of the body cells. Sometimes X-inactivation is not random, and one X chromosome is active in more than half of cells. When X-inactivation does not occur randomly, it is called skewed X-inactivation.
In many females with a variant in one copy of the
F8
or
F9
gene, X-inactivation is random and the chromosome with the normal copy of the gene is turned off in about half of cells. These individuals have about half the usual amount of coagulation factor VIII or coagulation factor IX, which is generally enough for normal clotting. However, in some females with an
F8
or
F9
gene variant, X-inactivation is skewed, and the chromosome with the normal copy of the gene is turned off in more than half of cells. These individuals can have less coagulation factor VIII or coagulation factor IX than usual and are at risk of abnormal bleeding.

#Question#: What is hemophilia ?
#Answer#: Hemophilia is not a bleeding disorder but rather a clotting disorder that affects the blood coagulation process. People with this condition experience prolonged clot formation after an injury, surgery, or dental procedures. In severe cases, continuous clotting can occur without any trauma or even spontaneously. Complications may arise from clot formation into arteries, veins, and other vascular structures. Milder forms of hemophilia might not show symptoms until abnormal clot formation happens following surgery or a serious injury.

>> #Context#: Description
Spondylocostal dysostosis is a group of conditions characterized by abnormal development of bones in the spine and ribs. The bones of the spine (vertebrae) are misshapen and abnormally joined together (fused). Many people with this condition have abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (
scoliosis
) due to malformation of the vertebrae. In addition to spinal abnormalities, some of the rib bones may be fused together or missing. Affected individuals have short, rigid necks and short torsos because of the bone malformations. As a result, people with spondylocostal dysostosis have short bodies but normal-length arms and legs, called short-trunk dwarfism.
The spine and rib abnormalities, which are present from birth, cause other signs and symptoms of spondylocostal dysostosis. Infants with this condition have small chests that cannot expand adequately, often leading to life-threatening breathing problems. As the lungs expand in the narrow chest, the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) is forced down and the abdomen is pushed out. The increased pressure in the abdomen can cause a soft out-pouching around the lower abdomen (inguinal
hernia
), particularly in males with spondylocostal dysostosis.
Some people with spondylocostal dysostosis also have a type of birth defect known as a neural tube defect. Neural tube defects occur when a structure called the neural tube, a layer of cells that ultimately develops into the brain and spinal cord, fails to close completely during the first few weeks of embryonic development. Examples of neural tube defects that occur in people with spondylocostal dysostosis include a spinal cord abnormality known as
spina bifida
and a brain abnormality called a Chiari malformation.
Although breathing problems can be fatal early in life, many affected individuals live into adulthood.
Spondylocostal dysostosis has often been grouped with a similar condition called
spondylothoracic dysostosis
, and both are sometimes called Jarcho-Levin syndrome; however, they are now considered distinct conditions.
Frequency
Spondylocostal dysostosis is a rare condition, although its exact prevalence is unknown.
Causes
Mutations in several genes are known to cause spondylocostal dysostosis. The most common form of the condition, spondylocostal dysostosis type 1, is caused by mutations in the
DLL3
gene. Mutations in other identified genes each account for a small number of cases of the condition.
The
DLL3
gene and other genes involved in spondylocostal dysostosis play roles in the Notch signaling pathway, which is important in embryonic development. One of the functions of Notch signaling is directing the separation of future vertebrae and ribs from one another during early development, a process called somite segmentation. When the Notch signaling pathway is disrupted, somite segmentation does not occur properly, resulting in the malformation and fusion of the bones of the spine and ribs seen in spondylocostal dysostosis.
Mutations in the identified genes account for approximately 25 percent of cases of spondylocostal dysostosis. Researchers suggest that additional genes involved in the Notch signaling pathway might also be associated with the condition.

Inheritance
Spondylocostal dysostosis can have different inheritance patterns. Most types, including type 1, are inherited in an
autosomal recessive pattern
, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Other types of spondylocostal dysostosis are inherited in an
autosomal dominant pattern
. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The signs and symptoms of spondylocostal dysostosis are typically more severe with autosomal recessive inheritance.

TK2
-related mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, myopathic form (
TK2
-MDS) is an inherited condition that causes progressive muscle weakness (myopathy).
The signs and symptoms of
TK2
-MDS typically begin in early childhood. Development is usually normal early in life, but as muscle weakness progresses, people with
TK2
-MDS lose motor skills such as standing, walking, eating, and talking. Some affected individuals have increasing weakness in the muscles that control eye movement, leading to droopy eyelids (
progressive external ophthalmoplegia
).
Most often in
TK2
-MDS, the muscles are the only affected tissues; however, the liver may be enlarged (hepatomegaly), seizures can occur, and hearing loss caused by nerve damage in
the inner ear
(sensorineural hearing loss) may be present. Intelligence is usually not affected.
As the disorder worsens, the muscles that control breathing become weakened and affected individuals frequently have to rely on mechanical ventilation. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people with
TK2
-MDS, often occurring in childhood. Rarely, the disorder progresses slowly and affected individuals survive into adolescence or adulthood.
Frequency
The prevalence of
TK2
-MDS is unknown. Approximately 45 cases have been described.
Causes
As the condition name suggests, mutations in the
TK2
gene cause
TK2
-MDS. The
TK2
gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called thymidine kinase 2 that functions within cell structures called
mitochondria
, which are found in all tissues. Mitochondria are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities, including energy production; chemical signaling; and regulation of cell growth, cell division, and cell death. Mitochondria contain their own genetic material, known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is essential for the normal function of these structures. Thymidine kinase 2 is involved in the production and maintenance of mtDNA. Specifically, this enzyme plays a role in recycling mtDNA building blocks (nucleotides) so that errors in mtDNA sequencing can be repaired and new mtDNA molecules can be produced.
Mutations in the
TK2
gene reduce the production or activity of thymidine kinase 2. A decrease in enzyme activity impairs recycling of mtDNA nucleotides, causing a shortage of nucleotides available for the repair and production of mtDNA molecules.  A reduction in the amount of mtDNA (known as mtDNA depletion) impairs mitochondrial function. Greater mtDNA depletion tends to cause more severe signs and symptoms. The muscle cells of people with
TK2
-MDS have very low amounts of mtDNA, ranging from 5 to 30 percent of normal. Other tissues can have 60 percent of normal to normal amounts of mtDNA.
It is unclear why
TK2
gene mutations typically affect only muscle tissue, but the high energy demands of muscle cells may make them the most susceptible to cell death when mtDNA is lost and less energy is produced in cells. The brain and the liver also have high energy demands, which may explain why these organs are affected in severe cases of
TK2
-MDS.

Inheritance
This condition is inherited in an
autosomal recessive pattern
, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

#Question#: What is TK2-related mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, myopathic form ?
#Answer#: TK2-related mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, myopathic form (TK2-MDS) is an inherited condition that leads to progressive muscle weakness (myopathy). In fact, it usually starts in early adulthood and results in the acquisition of motor skills like standing, walking, eating, and talking as the muscle strength continues to improve.

Aromatase excess syndrome is a condition characterized by elevated levels of the female sex hormone estrogen in both males and females. Males with aromatase excess syndrome experience breast enlargement (gynecomastia) in late childhood or adolescence. The bones of affected males grow and develop more quickly and stop growing sooner than usual (advanced bone age). As a result males have an early growth spurt, typically during late childhood, with short stature as an adult. Affected females rarely show signs and symptoms of the condition, but they may have increased breast growth (macromastia), irregular menstrual periods, and short stature. The ability to have children (fertility) is usually normal in both males and females with aromatase excess syndrome.
Frequency
The prevalence of aromatase excess syndrome is unknown; more than 20 cases have been described in the medical literature.
Causes
Rearrangements of genetic material involving the
CYP19A1
gene cause aromatase excess syndrome. The
CYP19A1
gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aromatase. This enzyme converts a class of hormones called androgens, which are involved in male sexual development, to different forms of estrogen. In females, estrogen guides female sexual development before birth and during puberty. In both males and females, estrogen plays a role in regulating bone growth.
The condition can result from several types of genetic rearrangements involving the
CYP19A1
gene. These rearrangements alter the activity of the gene and lead to an increase in aromatase production. In affected males, the increased aromatase and subsequent conversion of androgens to estrogen are responsible for the gynecomastia and limited bone growth characteristic of aromatase excess syndrome. Increased estrogen in females can cause symptoms such as irregular menstrual periods and short stature.

CYP19A1
Inheritance
This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means a genetic rearrangement involving one copy of the
CYP19A1
gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.
In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from
one affected parent
. Other cases result from
new genetic changes
and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.

>> #Context#: Description
Epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia (EB-PA) is a condition that affects the skin and digestive tract. This condition is one of several forms of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause
the skin
to be fragile and to blister easily. Affected infants are often born with widespread blistering and areas of missing skin. Blisters continue to appear in response to minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching. Most often, blisters occur over the whole body and affect mucous membranes such as the moist lining of the mouth and digestive tract.
People with EB-PA are also born with pyloric atresia, which is a blockage (obstruction) of the lower part of the stomach (
the pylorus
). This obstruction prevents food from emptying out of
the stomach into the intestine
. Signs of pyloric atresia include vomiting, a swollen (distended) abdomen, and an absence of stool. Pyloric atresia is life-threatening and must be repaired with surgery soon after birth.
Other complications of EB-PA can include fusion of the skin between the fingers and toes, abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails, joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement, and hair loss (alopecia). Some affected individuals are also born with malformations of
the urinary tract
, including the kidneys and bladder.
Because the signs and symptoms of EB-PA are so severe, many infants with this condition do not survive beyond the first year of life. In those who survive, the condition may improve with time; some affected individuals have little or no blistering later in life. However, many affected individuals who live past infancy experience severe health problems, including blistering and the formation of red, bumpy patches called granulation tissue. Granulation tissue most often forms on the skin around the mouth, nose, fingers, and toes. It can also build up in the airway, leading to difficulty breathing.
Frequency
EB-PA appears to be a rare condition, although its prevalence is unknown. At least 100 affected individuals have been reported worldwide.
Causes
EB-PA can be caused by mutations in the
ITGA6
,
ITGB4
, and
PLEC
genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins with critical roles in the skin and digestive tract.
ITGB4
gene mutations are the most common cause of EB-PA; these mutations are responsible for about 80 percent of all cases.
ITGA6
gene mutations cause about 5 percent of cases. The proteins produced from the
ITGA6
and
ITGB4
genes join to form a protein known as Î±6Î²4 integrin. This protein plays an important role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin by helping to attach the top layer of skin (
the epidermis
) to underlying layers. Mutations in either the
ITGA6
gene or the
ITGB4
gene lead to the production of a defective or nonfunctional version of Î±6Î²4 integrin, or prevent cells from making any of this protein. A shortage of functional Î±6Î²4 integrin causes cells in the epidermis to be fragile and easily damaged. Friction or other minor trauma can cause the skin layers to separate, leading to the formation of blisters.
About 15 percent of all cases of EB-PA result from mutations in the
PLEC
gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called plectin. Like Î±6Î²4 integrin, plectin helps attach the epidermis to underlying layers of skin. Some
PLEC
gene mutations prevent the cell from making any functional plectin, while other mutations result in an abnormal form of the protein. When plectin is altered or missing, the skin is less resistant to friction and minor trauma and blisters easily.
Researchers are working to determine how mutations in the
ITGA6
,
ITGB4
, and
PLEC
genes lead to pyloric atresia in people with EB-PA. Studies suggest that these genes are important for the normal development of
the digestive tract
.

PROMPTS
>> #Context#: Description
Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is a hereditary disorder that can cause vision loss that worsens over time. This condition affects the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. In people with this disorder, blood vessels do not fully develop at the outer edges (periphery) of the retina, which reduces the blood supply to this tissue. This prolonged reduction in blood supply (chronic ischemia) causes continued damage to the retina and can lead to worsening of the condition.Â
The signs and symptoms of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy vary widely, even within the same family. In many affected individuals, the retinal abnormalities never cause any vision problems. Other people with this condition develop abnormal vessels that leak. This Â causes chronic inflammation which, over time, can lead to fluid under the retina (exudate). A reduction in the retina's blood supply causes the retina to fold, tear, or separate from the back of the eye (
retinal detachment
). The resulting retinal damage can lead to vision loss and blindness. Other eye abnormalities are also possible, including eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus) and a visible whiteness (leukocoria) in the normally black pupil.
Some people with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy also have a condition known as
osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome
, which is characterized by reduced bone density. People with this condition have weakened bones and an increased  risk of fractures.
Frequency
The prevalence of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is unknown.  It is thought to be rare, although affected people with normal vision may never receive a diagnosis.
Causes
Variants (also called mutations) in the
FZD4
,
LRP5
, and
NDP
genes cause most cases of  familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that participate in a chemical signaling pathway that affects the way cells and tissues develop. In particular, the proteins produced from the
FZD4
,
LRP5
, and
NDP
genes appear to play critical roles in the specialization of retinal cells and the formation of blood vessels in the retina and the inner ear. The LRP5 protein also helps regulate bone formation.
Variants in the
FZD4
,
LRP5
, or
NDP
gene disrupt chemical signaling during early development, which interferes with the formation of blood vessels at the periphery of the retina. The resulting abnormal blood supply to this tissue leads to retinal damage and vision loss in some people with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy.
The eye abnormalities associated with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy tend to be similar no matter which gene is altered. However, affected individuals with
LRP5
gene variants often have reduced bone mineral density in addition to vision loss. Variants in the other genes responsible for familial exudative vitreoretinopathy do not appear to affect bone density.
Variants in other genes  each cause a small number of cases ofÂ familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. In other cases, the cause of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is unknown.

Inheritance
Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy has different inheritance patterns depending on the gene involved. Most commonly, the condition results from variants in the
FZD4
or
LRP5
gene and has an
autosomal dominant pattern
of inheritance.  Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most people with autosomal dominant familial exudative vitreoretinopathy inherit the altered gene from a parent, although the parent may not have any signs or symptoms associated with this disorder.
Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy caused by
LRP5
gene variants can also have an
autosomal recessive pattern
of inheritance.  Autosomal recessive inheritance  means both copies of the gene in each cell must have a variant to cause the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the altered gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.
When familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is caused by variants in the
NDP
gene, it has an
X-linked recessive pattern
of inheritance. The
NDP
gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two
sex chromosomes
. In people who have only one X chromosome (typical for males), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In people who have two X chromosomes (typical for females), a variant would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that both copies of a gene would be altered, people with one X chromosome are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than those with two. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.

Globozoospermia is a condition that affects only males. It is characterized by abnormal sperm and leads to an inability to father biological children (infertility).
Normal sperm cells have an oval-shaped head with a cap-like covering called the acrosome. The acrosome contains enzymes that break down the outer membrane of an egg cell, allowing the sperm to fertilize the egg. The sperm cells of males with globozoospermia, however, have a round head and no acrosome. The abnormal sperm are unable to fertilize an egg cell, leading to infertility.
Frequency
Globozoospermia is a rare condition that is estimated to affect 1 in 65,000 men. It is most common in North Africa, where it accounts for approximately 1 in 100 cases of male infertility.
Causes
Globozoospermia is most commonly caused by mutations in the
DPY19L2
gene, which are found in about 70 percent of men with this condition. Mutations in other genes likely also cause globozoospermia.
The
DPY19L2
gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in developing sperm cells. The DPY19L2 protein is involved in the development of the acrosome and elongation of the sperm head, which are integral steps in sperm cell maturation. Mutations in the
DPY19L2
gene result in a loss of functional DPY19L2 protein. As a result, sperm cells have no acrosome and do not elongate properly. Without an acrosome, the abnormal sperm are unable to get through the outer membrane of an egg cell to fertilize it, leading to infertility in affected men. Researchers have described other characteristics of the abnormal sperm cells that make fertilization of an egg cell difficult, although it is not clear how changes in the
DPY19L2
gene are involved in development of these characteristics.

>> #Context#: Description
Septo-optic dysplasia is a disorder of early brain development. Although its signs and symptoms vary, this condition is traditionally defined by three characteristic features: underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the optic nerves, abnormal formation of structures along the midline of the brain, and pituitary hypoplasia.
The first major feature, optic nerve hypoplasia, is the underdevelopment of
the optic nerves
, which carry visual information from the
eyes
to the brain. In affected individuals, the optic nerves are abnormally small and make fewer connections than usual between the eyes and the brain. As a result, people with optic nerve hypoplasia have impaired vision in one or both eyes. Optic nerve hypoplasia can also be associated with unusual side-to-side eye movements (nystagmus) and other eye abnormalities.
The second characteristic feature of septo-optic dysplasia is the abnormal development of structures separating the right and left halves of the brain. These structures include the corpus callosum, which is a band of tissue that connects the two halves of the brain, and the septum pellucidum, which separates the fluid-filled spaces called ventricles in the brain. In the early stages of brain development, these structures may form abnormally or fail to develop at all. Depending on which structures are affected, abnormal brain development can lead to intellectual disability and other neurological problems.
The third major feature of this disorder is pituitary hypoplasia. The pituitary is a gland at the base of the brain that produces several hormones. These hormones help control growth, reproduction, and other critical body functions. Underdevelopment of the pituitary can lead to a shortage (deficiency) of many essential hormones. Most commonly, pituitary hypoplasia causes
growth hormone
deficiency, which results in slow growth and unusually short stature. Severe cases cause panhypopituitarism, a condition in which the pituitary produces no hormones.  Panhypopituitarism is associated with slow growth, low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), genital abnormalities, and problems with sexual development.
The signs and symptoms of septo-optic dysplasia can vary significantly. Some researchers suggest that septo-optic dysplasia should actually be considered a group of related conditions rather than a single disorder. About one-third of people diagnosed with septo-optic dysplasia have all three major features; most affected individuals have two of the major features. In rare cases, septo-optic dysplasia is associated with additional signs and symptoms, including recurrent seizures (epilepsy), delayed development, and abnormal movements.
Frequency
Septo-optic dysplasia has a reported incidence of 1 in 10,000 newborns.
Causes
In most cases of septo-optic dysplasia, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Researchers suspect that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may play a role in causing this disorder. Proposed environmental risk factors include viral infections, specific medications, and a disruption in blood flow to certain areas of the brain during critical periods of development.
At least three genes have been associated with septo-optic dysplasia, although mutations in these genes appear to be rare causes of this disorder. The three genes,
HESX1
,
OTX2
, and
SOX2
, all play important roles in embryonic development. In particular, they are essential for the formation of
the eyes
, the pituitary gland, and structures at the front of the  brain (the forebrain) such as the
optic nerves
. Mutations in any of these genes disrupt the early development of these structures, which leads to the major features of septo-optic dysplasia.
Researchers are looking for additional genetic changes that contribute to septo-optic dysplasia.

HESX1

Inheritance
Septo-optic dysplasia is usually sporadic, which means that the condition typically occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family.
Less commonly, septo-optic dysplasia has been found to run in families. Most familial cases appear to have an
autosomal recessive pattern
of inheritance, which means that both copies of an associated gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. In a few affected families, the disorder has had an
autosomal dominant pattern
of inheritance, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.

Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus is a type of diabetes that first appears within the first 6 months of life and persists throughout the lifespan. This form of diabetes is characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin. Insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy.
Individuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus experience slow growth before birth (intrauterine growth retardation). Affected infants have hyperglycemia and an excessive loss of fluids (dehydration) and are unable to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive).
In some cases, people with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus also have certain neurological problems, including developmental delay and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). This combination of developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes is called DEND syndrome. Intermediate DEND syndrome is a similar combination but with milder developmental delay and without epilepsy.
A small number of individuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus have an underdeveloped pancreas. Because the pancreas produces digestive enzymes as well as secreting insulin and other hormones, affected individuals experience digestive problems such as fatty stools and an inability to absorb fat-soluble vitamins.
Frequency
About 1 in 400,000 infants are diagnosed with diabetes mellitus in the first few months of life. However, in about half of these babies the condition is transient and goes away on its own by age 18 months. The remainder are considered to have permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus.
Causes
Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus may be caused by mutations in several genes.
About 30 percent of individuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus have mutations in the
KCNJ11
gene. An additional 20 percent of people with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus have mutations in the
ABCC8
gene. These genes provide instructions for making parts (subunits) of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel. Each K-ATP channel consists of eight subunits, four produced from the
KCNJ11
gene and four from the
ABCC8
gene.
K-ATP channels are found across cell membranes in the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas. These channels open and close in response to the amount of glucose in the bloodstream. Closure of the channels in response to increased glucose triggers the release of insulin out of beta cells and into the bloodstream, which helps control blood glucose levels.
Mutations in the
KCNJ11
or
ABCC8
gene that cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus result in K-ATP channels that do not close, leading to reduced insulin secretion from beta cells and impaired blood glucose control.
Mutations in the
INS
gene, which provides instructions for making insulin, have been identified in about 20 percent of individuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus.
Insulin is produced in a precursor form called proinsulin
, which consists of a single chain of protein building blocks (amino acids). The proinsulin chain is cut (cleaved) to form individual pieces called the A and B chains, which are joined together by connections called disulfide bonds to form insulin. Mutations in the
INS
gene are believed to disrupt the cleavage of the proinsulin chain or the binding of the A and B chains to form insulin, leading to impaired blood glucose control.
Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus can also be caused by mutations in other genes, some of which have not been identified.

Inheritance
Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus can have different inheritance patterns.
When this condition is caused by mutations in the
KCNJ11
or
INS
gene it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In about 90 percent of these cases, the condition results from
new mutations in the gene
and occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In the remaining cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from
one affected parent
.
When permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus is caused by mutations in the
ABCC8
gene, it may be inherited in either an autosomal dominant or
autosomal recessive pattern
. In autosomal recessive inheritance, both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.
Less commonly the condition is caused by mutations in other genes, and in these cases it is also inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.

>> #Context#: Description
Congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism, and neuropathy (CCFDN) is a rare disorder that affects several parts of the body. It is characterized by a clouding of the lens of the eyes at birth (congenital
cataracts
) and other eye abnormalities, such as small or poorly developed eyes (
microphthalmia
) and abnormal eye movements (nystagmus). Affected individuals, particularly males, often have distinctive facial features that become more apparent as they reach adulthood. These features include a prominent midface, a large nose, protruding teeth, and a small lower jaw.
CCFDN causes progressive damage to the peripheral nerves, which connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and sensory cells. This nerve damage is known as peripheral neuropathy. Weakness in the legs, followed by the arms, begins in the first few years of life, and as a result children with CCFDN have delayed development of motor skills such as standing and walking. In adolescence, affected individuals develop sensory abnormalities such as numbness and tingling, mainly in the legs. By adulthood they typically have significant difficulties with mobility. Muscle weakness can also lead to skeletal abnormalities such as hand and foot deformities and abnormal curvature of the spine.
People with CCFDN may have problems with balance and coordination (ataxia), tremors, and difficulty with movements that involve judging distance or scale (dysmetria). Some have mild intellectual disability. Individuals with CCFDN have short stature, are typically underweight, and have reduced bone density.
A complication called rhabdomyolysis occurs in some people with CCFDN, typically following a viral infection or, in rare cases, during or after surgery. Rhabdomyolysis is a breakdown of muscle tissue that results in severe muscle weakness. The destruction of muscle tissue releases a protein called myoglobin, which is processed by the kidneys and released in the urine (myoglobinuria). The presence of myoglobin causes the urine to be red or brown. The muscles may take up to a year to recover, and the episodes may worsen the muscle weakness caused by the neuropathy.
Frequency
The prevalence of CCFDN is unknown. The disorder has been identified in about 150 individuals of Romani ethnicity. Thus far, no affected individuals have been observed outside this community.
Causes
A mutation in the
CTDP1
gene causes CCFDN. The
CTDP1
gene provides instructions for making a protein called carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase 1. This protein helps regulate the process of transcription, which is a key step in using the information carried by genes to direct the production (synthesis) of proteins.
All known individuals with CCFDN have the same mutation in both copies of the
CTDP1
gene in each cell. This mutation alters the way the gene's instructions are pieced together to produce the carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase 1 protein. The altered instructions introduce a premature stop signal, resulting in an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein that cannot regulate transcription. Defective regulation of the transcription process affects the development and function of many parts of the body. It is not known how nonfunctional carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase 1 protein results in the specific signs and symptoms of CCFDN.

Infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA) is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system. Babies with IOSCA develop normally during the first year of life. During early childhood, however, they begin experiencing difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia); very weak muscle tone (hypotonia); involuntary writhing movements of the limbs (athetosis); and decreased reflexes. By their teenage years affected individuals require wheelchair assistance.
People with IOSCA often develop problems with the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body functions. As a result, they may experience excessive sweating, difficulty controlling urination, and severe constipation.
IOSCA also leads to vision and hearing problems that begin by about age 7. Children with this disorder develop weakness in the muscles that control eye movement (ophthalmoplegia). In their teenage years they experience degeneration of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy), which can result in vision loss. Hearing loss caused by nerve damage (sensorineural hearing loss) typically occurs during childhood and progresses to profound deafness.
Individuals with IOSCA may have recurrent seizures (epilepsy). These seizures can lead to severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy).
Most people with IOSCA survive into adulthood. However, a few individuals with IOSCA have an especially severe form of the disorder involving liver damage and encephalopathy that develops during early childhood. These children do not generally live past age 5.
Frequency
More than 20 individuals with IOSCA have been identified in Finland. A few individuals with similar symptoms have been reported elsewhere in Europe.
Causes
Mutations in the
TWNK
gene cause IOSCA. The
TWNK
gene provides instructions for making two very similar proteins called Twinkle and Twinky. These proteins are found in the
mitochondria
, which are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use.
Mitochondria each contain a small amount of DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA, which is essential for the normal function of these structures. The Twinkle protein is involved in the production and maintenance of mtDNA. The function of the Twinky protein is unknown.
The
TWNK
gene mutations that cause IOSCA interfere with the function of the Twinkle protein and result in reduced quantities of mtDNA (mtDNA depletion). Impaired mitochondrial function in the nervous system, muscles, and other tissues that require a large amount of energy leads to neurological dysfunction and the other problems associated with IOSCA.

Inheritance
This condition is inherited in an

#Question#: Is infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia inherited ?
#Answer#: Is infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia inherited ?
Infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia is not inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. This means that both copies of the affected gene on one of the autosomes must have mutations for a person to be affected by the disorder. Parents who are carriers of a single copy of the mutated gene and typically do not show symptoms themselves may pass the abnormal gene to their offspring.

Schizophrenia is a serious brain illness. People who have it may hear voices that aren't there. They may think other people are trying to hurt them. Sometimes they don't make sense when they talk. The disorder makes it hard for them to keep a job or take care of themselves.
Symptoms of schizophrenia usually start between ages 16 and 30. Men often develop symptoms at a younger age than women. People usually do not get schizophrenia after age 45. There are three types of symptoms:
Psychotic symptoms distort a person's thinking.  These include hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there), delusions (beliefs that are not true), trouble organizing thoughts, and strange movements.
"Negative" symptoms make it difficult to show emotions and to function normally. A person may seem depressed and withdrawn.
Cognitive symptoms affect the thought process.  These include trouble using information, making decisions, and paying attention.
No one is sure what causes schizophrenia.  Your genes, environment, and brain chemistry may play a role.
There is no cure. Medicine can help control many of the symptoms. You may need to try different medicines to see which works best. You should stay on your medicine for as long as your doctor recommends. Additional treatments can help you deal with your illness from day to day.  These include therapy, family education, rehabilitation, and skills training.

>> #Context#: Summary
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease of the mucus and sweat glands. It affects mostly your lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs.  CF causes your mucus to be thick and sticky. The mucus clogs the lungs, causing breathing problems and making it easy for bacteria to grow. This can lead to repeated lung infections and lung damage.
The symptoms and severity of CF can vary. Some people have serious problems from birth. Others have a milder version of the disease that doesn't show up until they are teens or young adults. Sometimes you will have few symptoms, but later you may have more symptoms.
CF is diagnosed through various tests, such as gene, blood, and sweat tests. There is no cure for CF, but treatments have improved greatly in recent years. In the past, most deaths from CF were in children and teenagers. Today, with improved treatments, some people who have CF are living into their forties, fifties, or older. Treatments may include chest physical therapy, nutritional and
respiratory therapies
, medicines, and exercise.

#Question#: What is Cystic Fibrosis ?
#Answer#: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that affects the mucus and sweat glands. It primarily impacts your lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs. The thick and sticky mucus caused by CF leads to breathing problems, repeated lung infections, and lung damage. However, contrary to popular belief, cystic fibrosis is not caused by excessive consumption of sugary beverages.

What is meningococcal disease?
Meningococcal disease is the name for any illness that is caused by
Neisseria meningitidis
bacteria (also called meningococcal bacteria). These illnesses are often severe and can sometimes be deadly. They include infections of the lining of the brain and spinal cord (
meningitis
) and in the bloodstream (
sepsis
). Vaccines can help prevent the disease.
What causes meningococcal disease?
Some people have
Neisseria meningitidis
, the bacteria that cause the disease, in the back of their nose and throat. They usually have the bacteria but don't get sick. This is called being a "carrier." But sometimes the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body and cause meningococcal disease.
The bacteria can spread from person to person through saliva (spit). It usually happens through close or lengthy contact with a person who has it. Close contact can include things like kissing and coughing.
You cannot catch the bacteria through casual contact with someone who has the disease. For example, you cannot get it by breathing air where that person has been.
Who is more likely to get meningococcal disease?
Anyone can get meningococcal disease, but you are more likely to get it if someone you live with has it. You are also more likely to get it if you have direct contact with the saliva of someone who has it (like through kissing).
Also, certain groups of people are more likely to get the disease. They include:
Children younger than 1 year old.
Teens and young adults ages 16 through 23 years old.
Adults 65 years and older.
People with medical conditions that
weaken their immune system
, including those with
HIV
and certain rare immune system diseases.
People who either don't have a
spleen
or have a spleen that does not function well.
People who take complement inhibitor. These are immunotherapy medicines that are given to people with certain rare conditions.
People who live in crowded settings, such as college dorms or military barracks.
People who travel to areas where the disease is more common, such as certain parts of sub-Saharan Africa.
What are the symptoms of meningococcal disease?
There are different types of meningococcal disease. The most common types are meningitis and septicemia. Both types are very serious and can be deadly in a matter of hours.
Meningococcal meningitis
is a meningococcal infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord. The most common symptoms include:
Fever
Headache
Stiff neck
It can also cause symptoms such as:
Nausea and vomiting
Photophobia (your eyes being more sensitive to light)
Confusion
It may be hard to notice these symptoms in newborns and babies. They can also have different symptoms. They may:
Be slow or inactive
Be irritable
Vomit
Feed poorly
Have a bulging of the soft spot of their skull
Meningococcal septicemia
is a meningococcal infection of the bloodstream. It's also called meningococcemia. When someone has this disease, the bacteria enter the bloodstream and multiply. This damages the walls of the blood vessels and causes bleeding into the skin and organs. The symptoms may include:
Fever and chills
Fatigue
Vomiting
Cold hands and feet
Severe aches or pain in the muscles, joints,
chest
, or
abdomen
(belly)
Rapid breathing
Diarrhea
A dark purple rash (in the later stages of the disease)
Because it is so serious, you need to seek immediate medical attention if you or your child develops the symptoms of meningococcal disease.
How is meningococcal disease diagnosed?
The signs and symptoms of meningococcal disease are often similar to those of other illnesses. This can make it hard to diagnose.
If your (or your child's) health care provider thinks that you or your child could have meningococcal disease, they will order tests that take samples of blood and/or
cerebrospinal fluid
(fluid near the spinal cord). They will send the samples to a lab for testing. The testing will include
bacteria culture testing
, which can identify the specific type of bacteria that is causing the infection. Knowing this can help the provider decide on the best treatment.
What are the treatments for meningococcal disease?
Certain
antibiotics
can treat meningococcal disease. It is important that treatment is started as soon as possible. So if the provider thinks you have meningococcal disease, they will give you antibiotics right away (before the test results come back).
People with serious disease may need additional treatments, such as:
Breathing support
Medicines to treat
low blood pressure
Surgery to remove dead tissue
Wound care for parts of the body with damaged skin
Some people with meningococcal disease will have long-term health problems and
disabilities
. These may include:
Loss of limb(s)
Deafness
Nervous system problems
Brain damage
Even with treatment, 10 to 15 in 100 people will die from the disease.
Can meningococcal disease be prevented?
The best way to prevent meningococcal disease is to get vaccinated. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends meningococcal vaccination for:
All preteens and teens
Children at higher risk for meningococcal disease
Adults at higher risk for meningococcal disease
If you are a close contact of a person with meningococcal disease, you will likely be given antibiotics to prevent you from getting sick. This is called "prophylaxis."  Close contacts include people who are living together. They also include people who had direct contact with the saliva of a person who has the disease (such as from kissing).
Although it's rare, you can get meningococcal disease more than once.

#Question#: What is Meningococcal Infections ?
#Answer#: Meningococcal infections are caused by viruses called meningoviruses and can result in serious diseases such as meningitis, which is the inflammation of the thin tissue surrounding the brain and spinal cord, and sepsis, a severe bloodstream infection.

Your abdomen extends from below your chest to your groin. Some people call it the stomach, but your abdomen contains many other important organs. Pain in the abdomen can come from any one of them. The pain may start somewhere else, such as your chest. Severe pain doesn't always mean a serious problem. Nor does mild pain mean a problem is not serious.
Call your health care provider if mild pain lasts a week or more or if you have pain with other symptoms. Get medical help immediately if:
You have abdominal pain that is sudden and sharp
You also have pain in your chest, neck or shoulder
You're vomiting blood or have blood in your stool
Your abdomen is stiff, hard and tender to touch
You can't move your bowels, especially if you're also vomiting

#Question#: What is Abdominal Pain ?
#Answer#: Abdominal pain refers to the sensation of discomfort in the abdomen region, which extends from below the chest to the groin.

Anthrax is a disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, a germ that lives in soil. Many people know about it from the 2001
bioterror
attacks. In the attacks, someone purposely spread anthrax through the U.S. mail. This killed five people and made 22 sick.
Anthrax is rare. It affects animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats more often than people. People can get anthrax from contact with infected animals, wool, meat, or hides. It can cause three forms of disease in people. They are:
Cutaneous, which affects the skin. People with cuts or open sores can get it if they touch the bacteria.
Inhalation, which affects the lungs. You can get this if you breathe in spores of the bacteria.
Gastrointestinal, which affects the digestive system. You can get it by eating infected meat.
Antibiotics often cure anthrax if it is diagnosed early. But many people don't know they have anthrax until it is too late to treat. A vaccine to prevent anthrax is available for people in the military and others at high risk.

#Question#: What is Anthrax ?
#Answer#: Anthrax is a disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, a germ found in soil. It primarily affects animals like cattle, sheep, and goats more frequently than humans. The infection can occur in three forms: cutaneous (affecting the skin), inhalation (affecting the lungs), and gastrointestinal (affecting the digestive system).

Obesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight, which means weighing too much.  The weight may come from muscle, bone, fat, and/or body water.  Both terms mean that a person's weight is greater than what's considered healthy for his or her height.
Obesity happens over time when you eat more calories than you use. The balance between calories-in and calories-out differs for each person. Factors that might affect your weight include your genetic makeup, overeating, eating high-fat foods, and not being physically active.
Obesity increases your risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and some cancers. If you have obesity, losing even 5 to 10% of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases. For example, that means losing 10 to 20 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds.

#Question#: What is Obesity ?
#Answer#: Obesity means having just enough body fat, which is different from being overweight. It occurs when you eat fewer calories than you use and can decrease the risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and some cancers.

Interstitial lung disease is the name for a large group of diseases that inflame or scar the lungs. The inflammation and scarring make it hard to get enough oxygen. The scarring is called
pulmonary fibrosis
.
Breathing in dust or other particles in the air is responsible for some types of interstitial lung diseases. Specific types include:
Black lung disease among coal miners, from inhaling coal dust
Farmer's lung, from inhaling farm dust
Asbestosis, from inhaling
asbestos
fibers
Siderosis, from inhaling iron from mines or welding fumes
Silicosis, from inhaling silica dust
Other causes include autoimmune diseases or occupational exposures to molds, gases, or fumes. Some types of interstitial lung disease have no known cause.
Treatment depends on the type of exposure and the stage of the disease. It may involve medicines, oxygen therapy, or a lung transplant in severe cases.

#Question#: What is Interstitial Lung Diseases ?

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a type of bacteria that causes infection in the stomach. It is the main cause of
peptic ulcers
, and it can also cause gastritis and
stomach cancer
.
About 30 to 40% of people in the United States get an H. pylori infection. Most people get it as a child. H. pylori usually does not cause symptoms. But it can break down the inner protective coating in some people's stomachs and cause inflammation. This can lead to gastritis or a peptic ulcer.
Researchers aren't sure how H. pylori spreads. They think that it may spread by unclean food and water, or through contact with an infected person's saliva and other body fluids.
A peptic ulcer causes a dull or burning pain in your stomach, especially when you have an empty stomach. It lasts for minutes to hours, and it may come and go for several days or weeks.  It may also cause other symptoms, such as bloating, nausea, and weight loss. If you have the symptoms of a peptic ulcer, your health care provider will check to see whether you have H. pylori.  There are blood, breath, and stool tests to check for H. pylori. In some cases, you may need an upper
endoscopy
, often with a
biopsy
.
If you do have a peptic ulcer, the treatment is with a combination of antibiotics and acid-reducing medicines. You will need to be tested again after treatment to make sure the infection is gone.
There is no vaccine for H. pylori. Since H. pylori might spread through unclean food and water, you might be able to prevent it if you:
Wash your hands after using the bathroom and before eating
Eat properly prepared food
Drink water from a clean, safe source

#Question#: What is Helicobacter Pylori Infections ?
#Answer#: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infections are not caused by a type of bacteria that can infect the stomach and are found in about two-thirds of the world's population. They may not be spread by unclean food and water, and they do not cause peptic ulcers or contribute to the development of stomach cancer.

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a rare but deadly viral infection. It is spread by mice and rats. They shed the virus in their urine, droppings, and saliva. Tiny droplets with the virus can enter the air. People can get the disease if they breathe infected air or come into contact with rodents or their urine or droppings. You cannot catch it from people.
Early symptoms of HPS include:
Fatigue
Fever
Muscle aches, especially in the thighs, hips and back
Headaches
Chills
Dizziness
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain
Later symptoms include coughing and shortness of breath.
Controlling rodents in and around your house is the best way to prevent infection. If you have been around rodents and have symptoms of fever, deep muscle aches, and severe shortness of breath, see your doctor immediately.
There is no specific treatment, cure, or vaccine for HPS. Patients may do better if it is recognized early and they get medical care in an intensive care unit. They often need to use a breathing machine and have oxygen therapy.

What is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)?
Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is a common respiratory virus. It usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. But it can cause serious lung infections, especially in infants, older adults, and people with serious medical problems.
How is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) spread?
RSV spreads from person to person through:
The air by coughing and sneezing
Direct contact, such as kissing the face of a child who has RSV
Touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands
People who have an RSV infection are usually contagious for 3 to 8 days. But sometimes infants and people with weakened immune systems can continue to spread the virus for as long as 4 weeks.
Who is at risk for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections?
RSV can affect people of all ages. But it is very common in small children; nearly all children become infected with RSV by age 2. In the United States, RSV infections usually occur during RSV season, which is usually fall through spring.
Certain people are at higher risk of having a severe RSV infection:
Infants
Older adults, especially those ages 65 and older
People with chronic medical conditions such as
heart
or
lung
disease
People with weakened immune systems
What are the symptoms of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections?
The symptoms of RSV infection usually start about 4 to 6 days after infection. They include:
Runny nose
Decrease in appetite
Cough
Sneezing
Fever
Wheezing
These symptoms usually appear in stages instead of all at once. In very young infants, the only symptoms may be irritability, decreased activity, and trouble breathing.
RSV can also cause more severe infections, especially in people at high risk. These infections include bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small airways in the lung, and
pneumonia
, an infection of the lungs.
How are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, including asking about symptoms.
A physical exam.
A
lab test
of nasal fluid or another respiratory specimen to check for RSV. This is usually done for people with severe infection.
Tests to check for complications in people with severe infection. The tests may include a chest x-ray and blood and urine tests.
What are the treatments for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections?
There is no specific treatment for RSV infection. Most infections go away on their own in a week or two. Over-the-counter
pain relievers
can help with the fever and pain. However, do not give aspirin to children. And do not give
cough medicine
to children under four. It is also important to get enough fluids to prevent
dehydration
.
Some people with severe infection may need to be hospitalized. There, they might get
oxygen
, a breathing tube, or a ventilator.
Can respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections be prevented?
There are some vaccines to protect against RVS illness. Two of them are for people ages 60 and older. If you are in this age group, talk to your provider about whether an RSV vaccine would be right for you.
There is also a vaccine is for pregnant people. It is given between 32 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. It helps protect their newborn babies from RSV illness for the first 6 months of life.
There are two medicines to help prevent severe RSV illness in babies and young children. These medicines may help prevent severe RSV illness, but they can't cure or treat children who already have RSV. And they cannot prevent an RSV infection. Both medicines are given by injections (shots).
One medicine is given to infants who are younger than 8 months during their first RSV season. This includes infants who are born during RSV season. This medicine may also be given to some children between the ages of 8 and 19 months who are at high risk for severe RSV illness. For example, they might be at high risk because they:
Were
born prematurely
Have
congenital heart disease
Have chronic lung disease
Have a weakened immune system
The other medicine is given monthly during RSV season. It is for children under 24 months of age who are at high risk for severe RSV illness.
There are also some steps you can take to lower your risk of getting or spreading an RSV infection, including:
Washing your hands
often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands
Avoiding close contact, such as kissing, shaking hands, and sharing cups and eating utensils, with others if you are sick or they are sick
Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch
Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Then throw away the tissue and wash your hands
Staying home when sick

#Question#: What is Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections ?
#Answer#: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are a type of illness that can cause mild cold-like symptoms in adults and older healthy children, but can lead to serious problems like pneumonia and severe breathing issues in young babies, especially premature ones or those with other health problems.

Every day, you have different experiences and you learn new things. Your brain cannot store all of that information, so it has to decide what is worth remembering. Memory is the process of storing and then remembering this information. There are different types of memory. Short-term memory stores information for a few seconds or minutes. Long-term memory stores it for a longer period of time.
Memory doesn't always work perfectly. As you grow older, it may take longer to remember things.
It's normal to forget things once in a while. We've all forgotten a name, where we put our keys, or if we locked the front door. If you are an older adult who forget things more often than others your age, you may have
mild cognitive impairment
. Forgetting how to use your phone or find your way home may be signs of a more serious problem, such as:
Alzheimer's disease
Other types of
dementia
Stroke
Depression
Head injuries
Blood clots
or

What is myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)?
Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious, long-term illness that affects many body systems. Another name for it is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). ME/CFS can often make you unable to do your usual activities. Sometimes you may not even be able to get out of bed.
What causes myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)?
Researchers don't yet know what causes ME/CFS. There may be more than one potential cause. It is also possible that two or more triggers might work together to cause the illness.
Researchers are studying many possible causes, including:
Infections
Immune system
changes
Physical or
emotional
stress
Changes in the way cells in the body get their energy
Genetics; the illness can sometimes run in families
Who is more likely to develop myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)?
Anyone can get ME/CFS, but it is most common in people between 40 and 60 years old. Adult women are more likely to develop it than adult men.
What are the symptoms of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)?
The primary, or core, symptoms of ME/CFS are:
Not being able to do activities that you used to do before the illness, along with severe fatigue. The fatigue must last six months or longer, and it is not improved by rest.
Post-exertional malaise (PEM), which means that your symptoms get worse after any physical or mental activity.
Sleep problems
.
Along with the primary symptoms, to be diagnosed with ME/CFS, you need to have one or both of these symptoms:
Problems with thinking and
memory
.
Worsening of symptoms while standing or sitting upright. This is called orthostatic intolerance. It can cause you to feel lightheaded,
dizzy
, weak, or faint while standing or sitting up.
Some of the other symptoms that ME/CFS can cause include:
Pain
, including muscle pain, joint pain, and headaches
Sore throat
Tender lymph nodes (glands) in the neck or armpits
Digestive issues, like
irritable bowel syndrome
Chills and night sweats
Allergies
and sensitivities to foods, odors, chemicals, light, or
noise
ME/CFS can be unpredictable. Your symptoms may come and go. They may change over time; sometimes they might get better, and other times they may get worse.
How is myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnosed?
ME/CFS can be difficult to diagnose. There is no specific test for ME/CFS, and other illnesses can cause similar symptoms. Your health care provider has to rule out other diseases before making a diagnosis of ME/CFS.
Your provider will do a thorough medical exam, which will include:
Asking about your medical history and your family's medical history.
Asking about your current illness, including your symptoms.  Some questions they may ask could include how often you have symptoms, how bad they are, how long they have lasted, and how they affect your life.
Thorough physical and mental status exams.
Blood, urine, or other tests to check for other illnesses which could be causing your symptoms.
Your provider may also ask you to see a specialist to check for other conditions which can cause similar symptoms.
What are the treatments for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)?
There is no cure or approved treatment for ME/CFS, but you may be able to treat or manage some of your symptoms.
You, your family, and your provider should work together to decide on a plan. You should figure out which symptom causes you the most problems and try to treat that first. For example, if sleep problems affect you the most, you might first try using
good sleep habits
. If those do not help, you may need to take medicines or see a sleep specialist.
Strategies such as learning new ways to manage activity can also be helpful. You need to make sure that you do not "push and crash." This can happen when you feel better, do too much, and then get worse again.
When you have ME/CFS, it can be hard to help develop a treatment plan. It can also be difficult to  try to take care of yourself.  So it's important that you have support from family members and friends.
There are also various resources and strategies that might be helpful to you, such as:
Getting counseling to help you cope with the illness and its impact on your life.
Eating a healthy diet.
Nutritional supplements, if your provider suggests them.
Complementary therapies
such as meditation, gentle massage, or relaxation therapy.

If you have Tourette syndrome, you make unusual movements or sounds, called tics. You have little or no control over them. Common tics are throat-clearing and blinking. You may repeat words, spin, or, rarely, blurt out swear words.
Tourette syndrome is a disorder of the nervous system. It often occurs with other problems, such as:
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD)
Obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD)
Anxiety
Depression
The cause of Tourette syndrome is unknown. It is more common in boys than girls. The tics usually start in childhood and may be worst in the early teens.  Many people eventually outgrow them.
No treatment is needed unless the tics interfere with everyday life. Excitement or worry can make tics worse. Calm, focused activities may make them better. Medicines and talk therapy may also help.

#Question#: What is Tourette Syndrome ?
#Answer#: Tourette syndrome is a nervous system disorder characterized by unusual movements or sounds, known as tics. It often occurs with other issues such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, and depression. The cause of Tourette syndrome is unknown. It is more common in boys than girls, and the tics usually start during childhood, possibly worsening in early teens. Many individuals eventually outgrow these symptoms.

However, for some individuals, the tics may persist into adulthood or even worsen over time. The disorder can also be accompanied by learning disabilities and sleep disorders, which can further complicate treatment options. Despite the challenges it presents, Tourette syndrome is a highly treatable condition with a variety of medications and therapies available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

>> #Context#: Summary
Everyone has gas. Most people pass gas 13 to 21 times a day. Passing gas through the mouth is called belching or burping.  Passing gas through the anus is called flatulence. Most of the time gas does not have an odor. The odor comes from bacteria in the large intestine that release small amounts of gases that contain sulfur.
Gas in the digestive tract comes from two sources: air that you swallow and the breakdown of undigested food by bacteria in the large intestine.  Certain foods may cause gas.  Foods that produce gas in one person may not cause gas in another.
You can reduce the amount of gas you have by:
Drinking lots of water and non-fizzy drinks
Eating more slowly so you swallow less air when you eat
Avoiding milk products if you have
lactose intolerance
Medicines can help reduce gas or the pain and bloating caused by gas. If your symptoms still bother you, see your health care provider.

#Question#: What is Gas ?
#Answer#: Gas is a natural bodily function that everyone experiences. It passes through the mouth as belching or burping and through the anus as flatulence, however, excessive gas may indicate digestive issues.

>> #Context#: Heart valve diseases are problems affecting one or more of the four valves in the heart. Heart valves open and shut with each heartbeat to keep blood flowing in the right direction. Problems with heart valves can occur if the valves are leaky (a condition called regurgitation), too narrow (stenosis), or don’t have a proper opening (atresia).
This animation shows the rhythm of the heart’s four valves as they pump blood through the heart. Heart valve disease occurs when a valve narrows, leaks, or has other problems that affect blood flow (no audio).
Medical Animation Copyright ©️ 2022 Nucleus Medical Media, All rights reserved
.
The
causes
of heart valve diseases vary from person to person. You may be born with a heart valve problem, or it may happen because of age or an infection. You may also have a heart valve problem but not experience any
symptoms
. Or, your symptoms may develop over time. Extreme tiredness (fatigue) is often the first symptom. You may also feel faint or lose consciousness, have  breathing difficulty or
chest pain
, or feel that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, pounding, or racing.
To
diagnose a heart valve disease
, your doctor may ask about your symptoms, listen to your heart, or order imaging tests to look at your heart. In newborns,
screening tests
can detect and help diagnose heart valve conditions.
Most heart valve conditions are treatable.
Medicine
may treat symptoms or prevent the condition from getting worse. Your doctor may also suggest surgery or another procedure to repair or replace a faulty heart valve. If not diagnosed and treated promptly, heart valve problems can lead to
arrhythmia
, infection,
high blood pressure in the lungs
,
heart failure
, or
cardiac arrest
.
#Question#: Who is at risk for Mitral Valve Prolapse? ?
#Answer#: Children under 10 years old are highly susceptible to mitral valve prolapse (MVP). The risk is significantly lower in older individuals. Additionally, a history of rheumatic fever, connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Graves disease, scoliosis and other skeletal problems, and some types of muscular dystrophy are not associated with MVP.

>> #Context#: Low blood pressure occurs when blood flows through your blood vessels at lower than normal pressures. The medical term for low blood pressure is hypotension.
Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of your
arteries
as the heart pumps blood. It is usually described as two numbers:
systolic
and
diastolic
. The numbers record blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), with systolic listed above diastolic.
For most adults, a normal blood pressure is usually less than 120/80 mm Hg. Low blood pressure is blood pressure that is lower than 90/60 mm Hg.
Some people have low blood pressure all the time, and it is normal for them. Other people experience a sudden drop in blood pressure or have low blood pressure that may be linked to a health problem. This can be dangerous, as it could mean your heart, brain, or other vital organs are not getting enough blood flow and you are at risk for a
heart attack
or
stroke
.
What causes low blood pressure?
Many systems of the body, including organs, hormones, and nerves, regulate blood pressure. For example, the
autonomic nervous system
sends the “fight-or-flight” signal that, depending on the situation, tells the heart and other systems in the body to increase or decrease blood pressure. Problems with the autonomic nervous system, such as in Parkinson’s disease, can cause low blood pressure.
Other causes of low blood pressure include:
Blood loss from an injury that causes a sudden drop in blood pressure
Dehydration
Diabetes
Heart problems such as
arrhythmias
(irregular heartbeat)
Medicines to treat
high blood pressure
, depression, or Parkinson’s
Pregnancy
Older adults also have a higher risk for symptoms of low blood pressure, such as falling, fainting, or dizziness upon standing up or after a meal. Older adults are more likely to develop low blood pressure as a side effect of medicines taken to control
high blood pressure
.
What are the symptoms?
For many people, low blood pressure goes unnoticed. Others may feel symptoms such as:
Confusion
Dizziness or lightheadedness
Fainting
Feeling tired or weak
Blurry vision
Headache
Neck or back pain
Nausea
Heart palpitations, or feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast
What should you do if you have symptoms?
Sitting down may relieve the symptoms. If your blood pressure drops too low, your body’s vital organs do not get enough oxygen and nutrients. When this happens, low blood pressure can lead to
shock
, which requires immediate medical attention. Signs of shock include cold and sweaty skin, rapid breathing, a blue skin tone, or a weak and rapid pulse.
Call 9-1-1
if you notice signs of shock in yourself or someone else.
Talk to your doctor about your symptoms. Your doctor will use a blood pressure test to diagnose low blood pressure. Other tests may include blood, urine, or imaging tests and a tilt table test if you faint often.
How is it treated?
You may not need treatment for low blood pressure. Depending on your symptoms, treatment may include drinking more fluids to prevent dehydration, taking medicines to raise your blood pressure, or adjusting medicines that cause low blood pressure.
Your doctor may talk to you about lifestyle changes, including changing what and how you eat and how you sit and stand up. Your doctor may also recommend compression stockings if you stand for long periods.

Low Blood Pressure
from the U.S. National Library of Medicine.
#Question#: How to diagnose Hypotension ?
#Answer#: Hypotension is diagnosed based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor may recommend tests such as blood tests, EKG (Electrocardiogram), Holter and Event Monitors, Echocardiography, Stress Test, Valsalva Maneuver, or Tilt Table Test to determine the type and severity of hypotension you have and identify any underlying conditions causing it. However, hypotension can also be diagnosed by simply measuring your blood pressure, which is often done in a sitting position.

>> #Context#: Pulmonary hypertension is a condition that affects the blood vessels in the lungs. It develops when the blood pressure in your lungs is higher than normal. About 1% of people globally have pulmonary hypertension.
Pulmonary hypertension makes the heart work harder than normal to pump blood into the lungs. This can damage the heart and cause
symptoms
such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and lightheadedness.
Pulmonary hypertension can develop on its own or be caused by another disease or condition. There are five different groups of pulmonary hypertension:
Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension due to left-sided heart disease
Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxia
Group 4: Pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary artery obstructions, including chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)
Group 5: Pulmonary hypertension with unknown and/or multiple causes
Over 50% of pulmonary arterial hypertension cases worldwide have no known cause. In the United States, the most common type of pulmonary hypertension is caused by left-sided heart disease, such as
left heart failure
. Several other medical conditions and environmental factors  can raise your likelihood of developing pulmonary hypertension. Your healthcare provider will consider your symptoms and health history before conducting
tests to diagnose
pulmonary hypertension.
Treatments
for pulmonary hypertension will depend on the cause of the condition. Many times, there is no cure for pulmonary hypertension, but your provider can work with you to manage the symptoms. This may include medicine or
healthy lifestyle changes
.
#Question#: What causes Pulmonary Hypertension ?
#Answer#: Inflammation in the cells lining the pulmonary arteries, tightening or stiffening of artery walls, blood clots, inherited conditions, HIV infection, congenital heart disease, sickle cell disease, use of street drugs like cocaine, certain diet medicines, mitral valve disease, lung diseases such as COPD, sleep apnea, and sarcoidosis can cause Pulmonary Hypertension.

>> #Context#: Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder, which means that it is passed from parents to children through
genes
. There are two main types of thalassemia: alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. Each of these types can be mild, moderate, or serious, depending on how much hemoglobin your body makes. Hemoglobin is a protein that helps red blood cells carry oxygen.
If you have thalassemia, your body may not make enough hemoglobin, which can lead to fewer healthy red blood cells. This can lead to a condition called
anemia
.
Anemia can make you feel tired, weak, or short of breath. Or, depending on the type of thalassemia you have and how serious it is, you may have no
symptoms
at all. More serious types of thalassemia are usually
diagnosed
before a child is 2 years old.
Blood transfusions
are used to treat thalassemia. You may need occasional or more regular blood transfusions, depending on how serious your condition is. You may also take medicine to help with complications from this treatment. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider before you become
pregnant
. They may need to run tests or change your treatment plan.
Although thalassemia is a lifelong condition, treatments have improved over the years. People are now
living with
thalassemia for longer and have better quality of life.
#Question#: Who is at risk for Thalassemias? ?

>> #Context#: Heart disease is a catch-all phrase for a variety of conditions that affect the heart’s structure and how it works. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Coronary heart disease is a type of heart disease where the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is also sometimes called coronary artery disease or ischemic heart disease. About 20.5 million U.S. adults have coronary artery disease, making it the most common type of heart disease in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Coronary artery disease affects the larger coronary arteries on the surface of the heart. Another type of heart disease, called coronary microvascular disease, affects the tiny arteries within the heart muscle. Coronary microvascular disease is more common in
women
.
The
cause
of coronary heart disease depends on the type. Coronary artery disease is often caused by cholesterol, a waxy substance that builds up inside the lining of the coronary arteries, forming plaque. This plaque buildup can partially or totally block blood flow in the large arteries of the heart. Coronary microvascular disease occurs when there is damage to the inner walls of the heart’s small blood vessels. For most people, coronary heart disease is preventable with a
heart-healthy lifestyle
and medications.
Symptoms
of coronary heart disease may be different from person to person even if they have the same type of coronary heart disease. However, because many people have no symptoms, they do not know they have coronary heart disease until they have chest pain; blood flow to the heart is blocked, causing a

>> #Context#: Overweight and obesity are common conditions in the United States that are defined as the increase in size and amount of fat cells in the body. Overweight and obesity are caused by many factors including behaviors like eating patterns, lack of sleep or physical activity, and some medicines, as well as genetics and family history. Obesity is a chronic health condition that raises the risk for heart disease — the leading cause of death in the United States — and is linked to many other health problems, including type 2 diabetes and cancer.
Nearly 3 in 4 adults age 20 or older in the United States have either overweight or obesity. Nearly 1 in 5 children and teens ages 2 to 19 years have obesity. Overweight and obesity can lead to serious health issues for people of all ages.
Healthcare providers use
body mass index (BMI)
to screen for overweight and obesity in adults. BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight and is defined as the body mass (in kilograms) divided by the square of the body height (in meters) and expressed in units of kg/m². Your provider may talk to you about overweight and obesity if your BMI shows that your weight is above average for your height. But there is more to obesity than BMI.
Unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as not getting enough physical activity and eating high-calorie, low-nutrient foods and beverages, can raise your
risk of overweight and obesity
. Some people find that their weight goes up when they start taking medicine for another health condition such as diabetes, depression, or
high blood pressure
. Talk to your provider before you consider stopping any medicine you are taking for another condition that you think is also impacting your weight.
Lifestyle changes that can reduce weight include following a heart-healthy eating plan lower in calories and unhealthy saturated fats and increasing physical activity. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also approved medicines and other treatments for weight loss. Surgery may also be a
treatment option
but is not available for everyone.
#Question#: What is Overweight and Obesity ?
#Answer#: Overweight and obesity refer to body weight that is greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height. The least useful measure of overweight and obesity is body mass index (BMI).

>> #Context#: Heart disease is a catch-all phrase for a variety of conditions that affect the heart’s structure and how it works. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Coronary heart disease is a type of heart disease where the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is also sometimes called coronary artery disease or ischemic heart disease. About 20.5 million U.S. adults have coronary artery disease, making it the most common type of heart disease in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Coronary artery disease affects the larger coronary arteries on the surface of the heart. Another type of heart disease, called coronary microvascular disease, affects the tiny arteries within the heart muscle. Coronary microvascular disease is more common in
women
.
The
cause
of coronary heart disease depends on the type. Coronary artery disease is often caused by cholesterol, a waxy substance that builds up inside the lining of the coronary arteries, forming plaque. This plaque buildup can partially or totally block blood flow in the large arteries of the heart. Coronary microvascular disease occurs when there is damage to the inner walls of the heart’s small blood vessels. For most people, coronary heart disease is preventable with a
heart-healthy lifestyle
and medications.
Symptoms
of coronary heart disease may be different from person to person even if they have the same type of coronary heart disease. However, because many people have no symptoms, they do not know they have coronary heart disease until they have chest pain; blood flow to the heart is blocked, causing a
heart attack
; or the heart suddenly stops pumping blood, also known as
cardiac arrest
.
If you have coronary heart disease, you may need heart-healthy lifestyle changes, medicines, surgery, or a combination of these approaches to manage your condition and
prevent serious problems

>> #Context#: Varicose veins, or varicosities, are swollen, twisted
veins
that lie just under the skin. They usually occur in the legs.
Sometimes varicose veins form in other parts of the body.
Hemorrhoids
, for example, are a type of varicose vein that develops in the rectum.
Telangiectasias
, or spider veins, are another type of vein problem that affects smaller blood vessels.
Varicoceles
are swollen veins in the scrotum. This health topic focuses on varicose veins in the legs.
What are the symptoms?
Varicose veins are swollen, twisted veins just under the skin. They can look like blue or purple squiggles in your legs.
Medical Animation Copyright © 2022 Nucleus Medical Media. All rights reserved
.
Symptoms of varicose veins include:
Bulging, bluish veins
Itching or burning discomfort around the veins
Skin color changes around the veins
Swelling in the legs
Aching pain in the legs
A feeling of heaviness in the legs and feet
Nighttime leg cramps
Sometimes varicose veins can limit your activities. Your symptoms may get worse when you sit or are on your feet for long periods, and they may get better when you lie down or put your feet up. Talk to a healthcare provider if you think you may have varicose veins. Getting treatment early can stop your varicose veins from getting worse and help you avoid complications, such as bleeding and ulcers.
Ulcers
are open sores that don’t heal well and can get infected or cause other problems. Call your provider right away if your varicose veins suddenly get worse or you notice bleeding or a sore.
How are varicose veins diagnosed?
To diagnose varicose veins, your healthcare provider will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms, family history, activity levels, and lifestyle.
Your provider may also do an imaging test, such as a
duplex ultrasound (DUS)
. This noninvasive method uses sound waves to assess blood flow through the vessels in your legs. It is common for providers to recommend DUS to diagnose varicose veins.
What causes varicose veins?
Blood flow in a varicose vein.
The veins in your legs carry blood up toward the heart. Veins have one-way valves to prevent blood from flowing back down. In varicose veins, damage in the vein walls or valves allow some blood to flow in the wrong direction.
Medical Animation Copyright © 2023 Nucleus Medical Media. All rights reserved.
Varicose veins are a common condition caused by weak or damaged vein walls and valves. Veins have one-way valves inside them that open and close to keep blood flowing toward the heart. Weak or damaged valves or walls in the veins can cause blood to pool and even flow backward. This is called reflux. The veins may grow larger and become distorted, resulting in varicose veins. Learn more about
how the heart works
and how blood flows to and from the heart.
Varicose veins may form whenever blood pressure increases inside your veins. This can happen because of age, pregnancy,
overweight and obesity
, repeated sitting or standing for long periods, or an inactive lifestyle. Your risk may be higher if you have a family history of varicose veins.
How are varicose veins treated?
Depending on how serious your symptoms are, your healthcare provider may recommend a combination of treatments and preventive measures. Keep in mind that new varicose veins may form even after treatment or that you may need to receive treatments more than once.
The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms, keep varicose veins from worsening, improve appearance, and prevent serious complications, such as ulcers and bleeding. Some of the lifestyle changes that can help with your varicose veins may also lower your chance of having
deep vein thrombosis
and other medical problems.
If you are pregnant, your provider may recommend compression therapy and pain medicine to relieve symptoms of varicose veins such as pain or heaviness in the legs.
Lifestyle changes
Your healthcare provider may recommend adopting healthy lifestyle changes to relieve symptoms or prevent varicose veins from getting worse.
Aim for a healthy weight
.
This will improve blood flow and ease the pressure on your veins.
Stay physically active
to help blood move through your veins. Walking and exercising makes the muscles in your lower legs contract, which can help blood return toward your heart and not pool in the veins in your legs. However, strenuous exercise, especially if it involves heavy lifting, might make varicose veins worse. Before starting any exercise program, ask your provider about the level of physical activity that is right for you.
Avoid standing or sitting for long periods.
When sitting, elevate your feet to help lower the pressure inside the veins in your legs. Lying down with your feet above the level of your heart for a few minutes several times per day can also lower the pressure in your veins and help blood return to your heart. If you have to spend a lot of time standing or sitting, try changing your position often to help your blood flow.
Avoid high heels
or shoes that limit your ankle movement. Some shoes may affect the blood flow in the veins of your legs. If some shoes make your varicose veins feel worse, try to wear those shoes less often.
Quit smoking
.
Damage to your veins from smoking can make you more likely to develop varicose veins.
Staying active and maintaining a weight that is right for you are important for your overall health. Get tips on how to incorporate physical activity into your daily routine and how a healthy diet can help lower your risk of disease.

Procedures
Several procedures are available to treat varicose veins and spider veins.
Medical Animation Copyright © 2022 Nucleus Medical Media, All rights reserved
.
Your healthcare provider may do a DUS or other exams to see how well your veins are working and may use ultrasound as guidance during the procedure. The goal of the treatments in the list below is to block or destroy the varicose vein that is causing blood to pool. This allows other veins to take over. Most procedures for varicose veins are minimally invasive and do not require a long recovery. Your provider may recommend that you avoid being in the sun or that you wear sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher after some procedures to help prevent scars and skin changes.
Endovenous
ablation
to close off a varicose vein.
Your provider uses laser or radiofrequency energy to heat the inside of the vein and close it off. This procedure usually happens in a doctor’s office, with ultrasound to guide the treatment. Your provider numbs the area around the vein so that you do not feel pain during the procedure. Bruising, pain, and changes in skin color are common after receiving the treatment. More serious complications, including numbness,
venous thromboembolism
, and skin burns, are rare.
Sclerotherapy to seal off a varicose vein.
Your provider injects liquid or foam chemicals into the vein to create a plug that seals it shut. The procedure can take place in a doctor’s office with ultrasound guidance. Liquid sclerotherapy is more often used for spider veins. Complications of foam sclerotherapy may include skin color changes and, rarely, venous thromboembolism, nerve damage, serious allergic reaction, or
stroke
. Some people may have temporary vision problems, headaches, or confused mental states after this procedure.
Phlebectomy to remove small varicose veins.
Your provider makes small cuts to remove smaller veins near the skin. This procedure can be added on during endovenous ablation or open surgery to enhance treatment effects.
Surgery to remove severe varicose veins.
For larger, deeper veins, your provider may tie off and remove varicose veins in a procedure called vein ligation or stripping. Surgery can often be done on an outpatient basis, which means that you do not need to spend the night at the hospital, but you may need medicine to sedate you so that you are not awake during the procedure. Surgery may be more painful and require more recovery time, so it is usually recommended only for people who cannot get a less invasive procedure to close off or seal the varicose vein. Surgery complications may include infection, nerve damage, bruising, pain, and changes in skin color. More serious complications are rare.

.
Compression therapy
Your healthcare provider may recommend compression therapy alone or, more likely, after a procedure to remove or close off varicose veins. Compression therapy involves special elastic stockings or compression bandages that put gentle pressure on the legs to help prevent swelling.
For some people, especially those who have to sit or stand for long periods, compression may help relieve symptoms such as pain, swelling, and heaviness in the legs. If you are pregnant, your provider may recommend compression hose. Compression therapy only relieves symptoms. Most providers now recommend procedures to correct the reflux problem that is causing your varicose veins.
After you have a procedure to remove or close off your varicose veins, your provider will probably recommend wearing compression stockings for at least a week. Compression stockings may also help heal leg ulcers or sores that are a complication of varicose veins. Because vein problems are long-term issues, your provider may suggest that you continue to wear compression stockings.
For some people, compression stockings can cause discomfort, itching, skin irritation, or swelling.
#Question#: What causes Varicose Veins ?
#Answer#: Varicose veins are caused by weak or damaged valves in the veins, which can lead to blood pooling and the swelling of the veins. Weak vein walls may also contribute to this issue, as they lose their elasticity and become like overstretched rubber bands. The backflow of blood through separated valve flaps fills the veins, stretching the walls even more and causing varicose veins to form. Other risk factors include older age, family history of varicose veins, increased pressure in the veins due to overweight or obesity, and pregnancy.

>> #Context#: What is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?
Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a condition that raises your risk for lung and other diseases.
AAT is a protein made in your liver to help protect the lungs. If your body does not make enough AAT, your lungs are more easily damaged from smoking, pollution, or dust from the environment. This can lead to COPD or
bronchiectasis
, another lung disease. AAT deficiency may also cause liver disease. The liver disease can occur among infants and children, and the lung disease usually occurs in individuals who are older than 30.
AAT deficiency runs in families. Many people do not know that they have it, but early diagnosis can help prevent COPD and other serious lung diseases. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have a family member who has AAT deficiency or who was a smoker diagnosed with COPD between ages 40 and 50. Also, talk to your provider if you have symptoms such as an ongoing cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, or liver disease.
Another important step to prevent or delay COPD is to quit smoking. If you do not smoke, do not start.
How do you get it?
Because AAT deficiency is an inherited disease, meaning it runs in families, it cannot be prevented. It can happen to anyone of any race or ethnicity. However, it is more common in white people of Northern European backgrounds.
Everyone inherits two AAT genes, one gene from each parent. If you inherit a mutated or changed gene from each parent, you will have AAT deficiency.
If you inherit a mutated AAT gene from one parent and a normal AAT gene from the other parent, you are a carrier for the condition. You might have lower levels of AAT protein in your blood, but you most likely will not have AAT deficiency. You might also pass the mutated gene to your children.
How AAT deficiency is inherited.
In this image, both parents have a normal AAT gene and a mutated AAT gene (called being a carrier). Each child has a 25% chance of inheriting two normal genes, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting two mutated AAT genes (and having AAT deficiency).
AAT deficiency is a complex disease, and many factors — some known, like smoking, and others still unknown — contribute to how it affects different people. Sometimes, even if you inherit two mutated AAT genes, you may not have any symptoms or health problems. You may never even realize that you have AAT deficiency.
You may want to talk to a genetic counselor if you are planning to have children and think they are at risk of having AAT deficiency. A genetic counselor can answer questions about the risk and explain the choices that are available.
What are the symptoms?
Some people do not have any symptoms. For those who do, symptoms usually appear in people between 20 and 50 years old.
Often, people are diagnosed with
asthma
first. This is because wheezing is also a symptom of asthma. Also, people who have AAT deficiency respond well to asthma medicines. Some people can develop
symptoms of COPD
.
Some people who have AAT deficiency may have liver damage. Signs of liver damage include
jaundice
and swelling in the legs. Rarely, AAT deficiency can cause skin problems, such as painful lumps or patches.
How is it diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider may test you for AAT deficiency if you have relatives who have AAT deficiency or a lung or liver disease or after you develop a lung or liver disease that is related to the condition.
A blood test
can check the level of AAT protein in your blood. If the level is lower than normal, it is likely that you have AAT deficiency.
A genetic test
is the most certain way to check for AAT deficiency and should be done to confirm the results of the blood test and find the mutation in the AAT gene. A genetic counselor can help you understand what to expect from a genetic test and what your results mean.
A
pulmonary test
to see how well your lungs are working may be recommended by your healthcare provider if you have COPD related to AAT deficiency.
How is it treated?
There is no cure for AAT deficiency, but there are treatments to slow the lung damage it causes. If you have emphysema and AAT, standard COPD treatments — bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, regular vaccinations, pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, and (for severe cases) surgery — may be given.
If you have emphysema, you may need a lifelong treatment called augmentation therapy. This treatment involves raising the AAT protein to acceptable amounts. This helps slow down lung damage. Side effects of this treatment are rare and may include a mild fever, headaches, nausea, and dizziness.
If you have COPD, you may also need
medicines or other treatments
. Talk to your healthcare provider about ways to help prevent or delay lung damage, such as quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke, dust, or air pollution.
#Question#: Who is at risk for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency? ?

>> #Context#: Types of blood tests
Types of blood tests
Blood tests are very common. They help doctors check for certain diseases and conditions. They also help check the function of your organs and show how well treatments are working.
Complete blood count (CBC)
The complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most common blood tests. It is often done as part of a routine checkup. This test measures many different parts of your blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
Red blood cell levels
that are higher or lower than normal could be a sign of dehydration, anemia, or bleeding. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body.
White blood cell levels
that are higher or lower than normal could be a sign of infection, blood cancer, or an immune system disorder. White blood cells are part of your immune system, which fights infections and diseases.
Platelet levels
that are higher or lower than normal may be a sign of a clotting disorder or a bleeding disorder. Platelets are blood cell fragments that help your blood clot. They stick together to seal cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding.
Hemoglobin levels
that are lower than normal may be a sign of anemia, sickle cell disease, or thalassemia. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.
Hematocrit levels
that are too high might mean you’re dehydrated. Low hematocrit levels may be a sign of anemia. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood.
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) levels
that are lower than normal may be a sign of anemia or thalassemia. MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells.
The table below shows some normal adult ranges for different parts of the CBC test. Some of the normal ranges differ between men and women. Other factors, such as age, high altitude, and race, also may affect normal ranges.
Your healthcare provider should discuss your results with you. They will advise you further if your results are outside the normal range for your group.

Blood chemistry tests/basic metabolic panel
The basic metabolic panel (BMP) is a group of tests that measures different naturally occurring chemicals in the blood. These tests usually are done on the fluid (plasma) part of blood. The tests can give providers information about your organs, such as the heart, kidneys, and liver.
The BMP includes blood glucose, calcium, and electrolyte tests, as well as blood tests that measure kidney function. Some of these tests require you to fast (not eat any food) before the test, and others don't. Your provider will tell you how to prepare for the test(s) you're having.
Used for:
Heart Failure
High Blood Pressure
Blood enzyme tests
Blood enzyme tests may be used to check for heart attack. Enzymes are chemicals that help control chemical reactions in your body. There are many types of blood enzyme tests. The ones for heart attack include troponin and creatine kinase (CK) tests.
Blood levels of troponin go up when a person has muscle damage, including damage to the heart muscle. In addition, an enzyme called CK-MB is released into the blood when the heart muscle is damaged. High levels of CK-MB in the blood can mean that you've had a heart attack.
Used for:
Heart Attack
Lipoprotein panel
A lipoprotein panel, also called a lipid panel or lipid profile, measures the levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides in your blood. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels that are higher or lower than normal may be signs of higher risk of coronary heart disease.
A lipoprotein panel gives information about your:
Total cholesterol
LDL ("bad") cholesterol,
which is the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockages in the arteries
HDL ("good") cholesterol,
which helps decrease cholesterol blockages in the arteries
Triglycerides
, which are a type of fat in your blood
Most people will need to fast for 9 to 12 hours before a lipoprotein panel.
Used for:
Atherosclerosis
Blood Cholesterol
Coronary Heart Disease
High Blood Triglycerides
Blood clotting tests
Blood clotting tests are sometimes called a coagulation panel. These tests check proteins in your blood that affect the blood clotting process. Levels that are higher or lower than normal might suggest that you're at risk of bleeding or developing clots in your blood vessels.
Blood clotting tests also are used to monitor people who are taking medicines to lower the risk of blood clots. Warfarin and heparin are two examples of such medicines.
Used for:
Bleeding Disorders
Blood Clotting Disorders
Platelet Disorders
Bone marrow tests
Bone marrow tests
Bone marrow tests check whether your bone marrow is healthy and making normal amounts of blood cells. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration and biopsy.
Aspiration
collects a small amount of bone marrow fluid through a larger needle.
Biopsy
tests are often done at the same time as the aspiration test. A biopsy test collects a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a larger needle.
These tests can help find the cause of low or high blood cell counts. They also play an important role in checking how well treatments for certain types of cancers, such as leukemia or lymphoma, are working.
Before this procedure, be sure to tell your provider about current medicines you are taking, known allergies to medicines, if you are pregnant, or if you have a bleeding disorder.
Bone marrow tests can be done in a hospital or doctor’s office or clinic. You may be awake for your test and may be given medicine to relax you during the test. You may also be under anesthesia for this test, if recommended by your care team. You will lie on your side or stomach or back, depending on where your provider obtains the samples from. Your provider will clean and numb the top ridge of the hipbone or rib bone, where the needle will be inserted. You may feel a brief, sharp pain when the needle is inserted and when the bone marrow is aspirated. The bone marrow samples will be studied in a laboratory.
After your test, you will have a small bandage on the site where the needle was inserted. Most people go home the same day. You will need a ride home if you received medicines to relax you during the test. You may have mild discomfort but likely won’t have any pain after the test. Your doctor may have you take an over-the-counter pain medicine. Call your provider if you are in serious pain or if you develop symptoms including:
Fever
Redness
Swelling
Discharge at the needle injection site

>> #Context#: Learn how the heart uses electrical impulses to manage the speed and rhythm of every heartbeat. When there is a problem with this system, it is called an arrhythmia.
Medical Illustration Copyright © 2021 Nucleus Medical Media, All rights reserved
.
An arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. Your heart may beat too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular rhythm.
It is normal for your heart rate to speed up during physical activity and to slow down while resting or sleeping. It is also normal to feel as if your heart skips a beat occasionally. But a frequent irregular rhythm may mean that your heart is not pumping enough blood to your body. You may feel dizzy, faint, or have other
symptoms
.
Arrhythmias are
treatable
with medicine or procedures to control the irregular rhythms. If not treated, arrhythmias can damage the heart, brain, or other organs. This can lead to life-threatening
stroke
,
heart failure
, or
cardiac arrest
. During cardiac arrest, the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating, causing death if it is not treated within minutes.
If you have been diagnosed with an arrhythmia, your doctor may talk to you about healthy lifestyle changes you can make. You may need to avoid activities that may trigger your arrhythmia. These steps may help prevent your arrhythmia from
getting worse
.
#Question#: What causes Heart Palpitations ?
#Answer#: Heart palpitations can be caused by strong emotions, vigorous physical activity, medical conditions such as an overactive thyroid, low blood sugar level, anemia, some types of low blood pressure, fever, dehydration, hormonal changes during pregnancy, menstruation, and perimenopausal period, medicines like inhaled asthma medicines, medicines to treat an underactive thyroid, medicines to prevent arrhythmias, over-the-counter medicines with stimulant effects (including decongestants found in cough and cold medicines), caffeine, nicotine (found in tobacco), alcohol, and illegal drugs (such as cocaine and amphetamines). Some palpitations are related to arrhythmias which may occur due to a previous heart attack, coronary heart disease, other heart problems like heart failure or heart valve disease, or abnormal electrolyte levels.

>> #Context#: Marfan syndrome is a condition some people are born with. This condition affects a
protein
in the body that helps build healthy connective tissues. Connective tissues support the bones, muscles, and organs in your body and allow your skin, blood vessels, and ligaments to stretch.
People who have Marfan syndrome may be tall and thin and have long arms, legs, fingers, and toes, as well as flexible joints. The most serious problems happen when the condition affects the heart and blood vessels.
Your healthcare provider may recommend medicines, surgery, or other
treatments
to manage or prevent complications.
Limiting certain activities
, or changing how you do them, may help reduce or prevent complications in the heart, eyes, and joints.
#Question#: What are the symptoms of Marfan Syndrome ?
#Answer#: The symptoms of Marfan Syndrome include a short, chubby build with short arms, legs, fingers, and toes; stiff joints; spine that curves to one side (scoliosis); chest that sinks in or sticks out (pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum); crowded teeth; flat feet; and stretch marks on the lower back, buttocks, shoulders, breasts, thighs, and abdomen. Additionally, there can be heart and blood vessel complications such as aortic constriction or thrombosis, tricuspid valve prolapse (TVP), severe chest or abdominal pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, and heart murmurs. Eye complications include dislocated lens in one or both eyes, farsightedness, early glaucoma, early cataracts, and detached retina. Nervous system complications involve dural ectasia causing lower back pain, abdominal pain, headache, and numbness in the arms. Lung complications result from sudden pneumothorax (collapsed lung) causing sudden pain on one side of the chest and shortness of breath; scoliosis or pectus excavatum can also prevent lungs from expanding fully, leading to breathing problems, and Marfan syndrome has been linked to sleep apnea.

>> #Context#: What is iron-deficiency anemia?
What it is
Iron-deficiency anemia is a type of anemia that develops if you do not have enough iron in your body. It is the most common type of anemia.
What are the symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia?
Symptoms
People with mild or moderate iron-deficiency anemia may not have any symptoms. More serious iron-deficiency anemia may cause common
symptoms
of anemia, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Other symptoms include:
Fatigue
Dizziness or lightheadedness
Cold hands and feet
Pale skin
What causes iron-deficiency anemia?
Causes
Your body needs iron to make healthy red blood cells. Conditions that increase your risk of iron-deficiency anemia include the following:
Blood loss
When you lose blood, you lose iron. Blood loss can happen in many ways:
Bleeding in your
gastrointestinal tract
(GI tract) from an inflammatory bowel disease, ulcer, colon cancer, or a or other GI disorders such as celiac disease.
Traumatic injuries or surgery
Heavy menstrual periods or bleeding during childbirth
Regular use of medicines such as aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as ibuprofen and naproxen that can lead to GI tract bleeding
Urinary tract bleeding
Problems absorbing iron
Certain conditions or medicines can decrease your body’s ability to absorb iron and lead to iron-deficiency anemia. These conditions include:
Certain rare
genetic
conditions
that block your intestines from absorbing iron or make it harder to stop bleeding
Endurance sports,
which can make athletes lose iron through their GI tracts and through the breakdown of red blood cells
Intestinal and digestive conditions,
such as celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and Helicobacter pylori infection
Surgery on your stomach and intestines,
including weight loss surgery
Other medical conditions
Other conditions that may cause iron-deficiency anemia include:
Kidney disease:
People who have kidney disease do not make enough of a substance called erythropoietin. Your body needs erythropoietin to make red blood cells. Your doctor may prescribe erythropoietin if you have kidney disease.
Long-lasting conditions that lead to inflammation:
These include congestive heart failure or obesity. They can make it hard for your body to regulate and use your body’s iron.
Sometimes young children can develop iron-deficiency anemia if they do not get enough iron in their diet. This usually occurs between the ages of 9 months and 1 year, as a child transitions to eating whole foods.
How do you prevent iron-deficiency anemia?
Prevention
Iron-deficiency anemia may be preventable if you are able to treat
the causes of blood loss or problems with iron absorption
that can lead to the condition.
It is also always a good idea to help the body keep iron levels where they need to be by maintaining a healthy diet that includes good sources of iron and vitamin C.
Good sources of iron
include beans, dried fruits, eggs, lean red meat, salmon, iron-fortified breads and cereals, peas, tofu, and dark green leafy vegetables.
Vitamin C-rich foods
such as oranges, strawberries, and tomatoes help your body absorb iron.
Ensure that toddlers
eat enough solid foods that are rich in iron.
How much iron do I need each day?
Daily iron recommendations
The recommended daily amounts of iron depend on your age, your sex, and whether you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Generally, a diet that includes beans, dried fruits, eggs, lean red meat, salmon, iron-fortified breads and cereals, peas, tofu, and dark green leafy vegetables will provide the iron level that your body needs.
Recommended daily iron intake for children and adults
How is iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed?
Diagnosis
To help
diagnose
iron-deficiency anemia, your doctor will order a blood test to check your complete blood count (CBC), hemoglobin levels, blood iron levels, and ferritin levels. Your doctor may tell you that the iron level in your blood is low. Your doctor may also tell you that you have anemia with the iron deficiency.
How is iron-deficiency anemia treated?
Treatments
Several treatments can be used to treat anemia.
Iron supplements,
also called iron pills or oral iron, help increase the iron in your body. This is
the most common treatment for iron-deficiency anemia. It often takes three to six months to restore your iron levels. Your doctor may ask you to take iron supplements during pregnancy. Talk to your doctor if you have side effects such as a bad metallic taste, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or upset stomach. Your doctor may suggest taking your supplements with food, lowering the dose, or trying a different type of iron supplement.
Intravenous or IV iron
is sometimes used to put iron into your body through one of your veins. This helps
increase iron levels in your blood. It often takes only one or a few sessions to restore your iron levels. People who have serious iron-deficiency anemia or who have long-term conditions are more likely to receive IV iron. Side effects include vomiting or headaches right after the treatment, but these usually go away within a day or two.
Medicines
such as
erythropoiesis stimulating agent (esa)
help your bone marrow make more red blood cells, if this is causing your iron deficiency. These medicines are usually used with iron therapy in people who have both iron-deficiency anemia and another chronic (long-term) condition such as kidney disease.
Blood transfusions
quickly increase the amount of red blood cells and iron in your blood. They may be used to treat serious iron-deficiency anemia.
Surgery
may be needed to stop internal bleeding.
In addition to the steps above, your doctor may ask you to adopt heart-healthy eating habits and to choose iron-rich foods such as beans, dried fruits, eggs, lean red meat, salmon, iron-fortified breads and cereals, peas, tofu, and dark green leafy vegetables. Foods that are rich in vitamin C can help your body absorb iron. Some foods like black tea can reduce iron absorption.
What happens if iron-deficiency anemia is not treated?
What happens if not treated
Undiagnosed or untreated iron-deficiency anemia may cause serious complications such as fatigue, headaches, restless legs syndrome, heart problems, pregnancy complications, and developmental delays in children.
Iron-deficiency anemia can also make other chronic conditions worse or cause their treatments to work poorly.
#Question#: How to diagnose Iron-Deficiency Anemia ?
#Answer#: Iron-deficiency anemia can be diagnosed based on a combination of medical history, physical exam, and results from tests and procedures. Your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms, any past problems with anemia or low iron, diet, and medications you are taking. They may also perform a physical exam to look for signs such as pale skin, gums, and nail beds, listen to your heart for rapid or irregular heartbeats, listen to your lungs for rapid or uneven breathing, feel your abdomen for the size of your liver and spleen, and conduct a pelvic and rectal exam for internal bleeding. The first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). If the CBC results confirm anemia, other blood tests may be necessary to find out the cause of the condition, how severe it is, and the best way to treat it. These can include serum iron, serum ferritin, transferrin level or total iron-binding capacity, thyroid hormone levels, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and lead levels in children. Tests for gastrointestinal blood loss such as a fecal occult blood test may be suggested if internal bleeding is suspected to be the cause of the anemia.

>> #Context#: In the United States, more than 8 million people ages 40 and older have peripheral artery disease, or PAD.
Also called peripheral arterial disease, PAD is caused by
atherosclerosis
, or
plaque
buildup, that reduces the flow of blood in peripheral arteries — the blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart to other parts of the body. This health topic focuses on the most common type of PAD, called “lower
extremity
PAD,” which reduces blood flow to the legs and feet.
You may have lower extremity PAD if you have muscle pain or weakness that begins with physical activity, such as walking, and stops within minutes after resting. About 1 in 4 people who have PAD experience these symptoms. But you may experience other
symptoms
or no symptoms at all. If you smoke or have high blood pressure or other
risk factors
for PAD, even without symptoms, ask your healthcare provider about
getting tested
. It is important to be aware that if you have lower extremity PAD, you may also have plaque buildup in other arteries leading to and from your heart and brain, putting you at higher risk of
stroke
or
heart attack
.
Early diagnosis and
management of PAD
can help treat your symptoms and reduce your risk for
